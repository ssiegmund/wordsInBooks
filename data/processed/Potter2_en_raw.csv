Harry Potter AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX 
The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and 
"a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet "
Drive. Cars that were usually glea
ming stood dusty in their drives and 
lawns that were once emerald green 
lay parched and yellowing; the use 
of hosepipes had been banned due to 
drought. Deprived of their usual 
car-washing and lawn-mowing pursui
"ts, the inhabitants of Privet "
Drive had retreated into the shad
"e of their cool houses, windows "
thrown wide in the hope of temp
ting in a nonexistent breeze. The 
only person left outdoors was a teen
age boy who was lying flat on his 
back in a flower bed outside number four. 
"He was a skinny, black-haired, "
bespectacled boy who had the 
"pinched, slightly unhealthy look of"
 someone who has grown a lot in a 
short space of time. His jeans were 
"torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy "
"and faded, and the soles of his traine"
rs were peeling away from the up-
pers. Harry Potter’s appearance di
d not endear him to
" the neighbors, "
who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be pun-
"ishable by law, but as he had hi"
dden himself behind a large hydrangea 
bush this evening he was quite invisi
"ble to passersby. In fact, the only "
T 
 2 way he would be spotted was if his
 Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia 
stuck their heads out of the living 
room window and looked straight 
down into the flower bed below. 
"On the whole, Harry thought he "
was to be congratulated on his 
"idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on "
"the hot, hard earth, but on the "
"other hand, nobody"
 was glaring at 
"him, grinding their teeth so loudly th"
"at he could not hear the news, or "
"shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had "
tried sitting down in the living room
 and watching television with his 
aunt and uncle. 
Almost as though this thought 
had fluttered through the open win-
"dow, Vernon Dursley, Harry’s uncle, suddenly spoke. “Glad to see the "
boy’s stopped trying to butt
 in. Where is 
he anyway?” 
"“I don’t know,” said Aunt Petu"
nia unconcernedly. “Not in the 
house.” 
Uncle Vernon grunted. 
“
Watching the news
 . . .” he said scathingly. “I’d like to know what 
he’s really up to. As if a normal 
boy cares what’s on the news — Dud-
ley hasn’t got a clue what’s goin
"g on, doubt he knows who the Prime "
"Minister is! Anyway, it’s not as if there’d be anything about "
his lot
 on 
our
 news —” 
"“Vernon, "
shh
!” said Aunt Petunia. 
“The window’s open!” 
"“Oh — yes — sorry, dear . . .” "
The Dursleys fell silent. Harry list
ened to a jingle about Fruit ’N 
Bran breakfast cereal while he watc
"hed Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-loving "
old lady from nearby 
"Wisteria Walk, amble "
slowly past. She was 
frowning and muttering to herself.
 Harry was very pleased that he was 
concealed behind the bush; Mrs. Fi
gg had recently taken to asking 
him around for tea whenever she 
met him in the street. She had 
rounded the corner and vanished fr
om view before Uncle Vernon’s 
voice floated out of 
the window again. 
   3 “Dudders out for tea?” 
"“At the Polkisses’,” said Aunt Petunia fondly. “He’s got so many lit-"
"tle friends, he’s "
so popular . . .” 
Harry repressed a snort with difficu
lty. The Dursleys really were as-
"tonishingly stupid about their son, "
Dudley; they had swallowed all his 
dim-witted lies about having tea wi
th a different member of his gang 
every night of the summer holidays
. Harry knew perfectly well that 
Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every 
"evening vandalizing the play park, "
"smoking on street corners, and "
throwing stones at passing cars 
and children. Harry had seen them at 
it during his evening walks around
 Little Whinging; he had spent 
most of the holidays 
"wandering the streets, "
scavenging newspapers 
from bins along the way. 
The opening notes of the music th
at heralded the seven o’clock 
news reached Harry’s ears and his 
stomach turned over. Perhaps 
tonight — after a month of waiting — would be the night — 
“Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the 
Spanish baggage-handlers’ strike
 reaches its second week —” 
"“Give ’em a lifelong siesta, I would,” snarled Uncle Vernon over the "
"end of the newsreader’s sentence, but "
no matter: Outside in the flower 
"bed, Harry’s stomach seemed to un"
"clench. If anything had happened, "
it would surely have been the first item on the news; death and de-
struction were more im
portant than stranded holidaymakers. . . . 
"He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky. "
Every day this summer had been th
"e same: the tension, the expecta-"
"tion, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again . . . and "
"always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of "
why
 noth-
ing had happened yet. . . . 
"He kept listening, just in case "
"there was some small clue, not rec-"
ognized for what it really was 
by the Muggles — an unexplained 
"disappearance,   perhaps,   or   some "
  strange   accident . . . but   the  
 4 baggage-handlers’ strike was followe
d by news on the drought in the 
Southeast (“I hope he’s listening 
"next door!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, "
“with his sprinklers on at three in the morning!”); then a helicopter 
"that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress’s di-"
vorce from her famous husband (“as if
 we’re interested in their sordid 
"affairs,” sniffed Aunt Petunia, who "
had followed the case obsessively 
in every magazine she coul
d lay her bony hands on). 
Harry closed his eyes against the 
now blazing evening sky as the 
"newsreader said, “And finally, Bung"
y the budgie has found a novel 
way of keeping cool this summer. Bu
"ngy, who lives at the Five Feath-"
"ers in Barnsley, has learned to wate"
r-ski! Mary Dorkins went to find 
out more. . . .” 
Harry opened his eyes 
again. If they had 
reached water-skiing 
"budgerigars, there was nothing el"
se worth hearing. He rolled cau-
tiously onto his front and raised 
"himself onto his knees and elbows, "
preparing to crawl out from under the window. 
He had moved about two inches 
when several things happened in 
very quick succession. 
"A loud, echoing "
crack
 broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat 
streaked out from under a parked car 
"and flew out of sight; a shriek, a "
"bellowed oath, and the sound of breaking china came from the Durs-"
"leys’ living room, and as though"
 Harry had been waiting for this 
"signal, he jumped to his feet, at th"
e same time pulling from the waist-
band of his jeans a thin wooden wa
nd as if he were unsheathing a 
sword. But before he could draw himse
"lf up to full height, the top of "
"his head collided with the Dursleys’ open window, and the resultant "
crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder. 
Harry felt as if his head had been sp
"lit in two; eyes streaming, he "
"swayed, trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise, "
but he had barely staggered upri
ght again when two large purple 
hands reached through the open wi
ndow and closed 
tightly around 
his throat. 
   5 “
Put 
— 
it 
— 
away
!”
Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry’s ear. “
Now
!
Before 
— 
anyone 
— 
sees
!” 
“Get — off — me!” Harry gasped
; for a few seconds they strug-
"gled, Harry pulling at his uncle’s sa"
usage-like fingers with his left 
"hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand. Then, as "
"the pain in the top of Harry’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, Un-"
cle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an 
electric shock — some invisible forc
e seemed to have surged through 
"his nephew, making him "
impossible to hold. 
"Panting, Harry fell forward over th"
"e hydrangea bush, straightened "
"up, and stared around. There was no "
sign of what had caused the loud 
"cracking noise, but there were se"
veral faces peering through various 
nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wa
nd hastily back into his jeans 
and tried to look innocent. 
“Lovely evening!” shouted Uncle Ve
"rnon, waving at Mrs. Number "
"Seven, who was glaring from behind"
 her net curtains. “Did you hear 
that car backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!” 
He continued to grin in a horribl
"e, manic way until all the curious "
neighbors had disappeared from thei
"r various windows, then the grin "
became a grimace of ra
ge as he beckoned Harry back toward him. 
"Harry moved a few steps closer, taking "
care to stop just short of the 
point at which Uncle Vernon’s outs
tretched hands could resume their 
strangling. 
“What the 
devil
" do you mean by it, boy?” "
asked Uncle Vernon in a 
croaky voice that trembled with fury. 
“What do I mean by what?” said Ha
rry coldly. He kept looking left 
"and right up the street, still hoping"
 to see the person who had made 
the cracking noise. 
“Making a racket like a starting
 pistol right outside our —” 
“I didn’t make that no
"ise,” said Harry firmly. "
"Aunt Petunia’s thin, horsey face"
 now appeared beside Uncle Ver-
"non’s wide, purple one. She looked livid. "
 6 “Why were you lurkin
g under our window?” 
"“Yes — yes, good point, Petunia! "
What were you doing under our 
"window, boy"
?” 
"“Listening to the news,” said"
 Harry in a resigned voice. 
His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage. 
“Listening to the news! 
Again
?” 
"“Well, it changes every da"
"y, you see,” said Harry. "
"“Don’t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what you’re re-"
ally up to — and don’t give me any more of this 
listening to the news
tosh! You know perfectly well that 
your lot
 . . .” 
"“Careful, Vernon!” breathed Aunt"
" Petunia, and Uncle Vernon low-"
ered his voice so that Harry coul
"d barely hear him, “. . . that "
your lot 
don’t get on 
our
 news!” 
"“That’s all you know,” said Harry. "
The Dursleys goggled at him for 
"a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia "
"said, “You’re a nasty little liar. Wh"
at are all those —” she too lowered 
her voice so that Harry had to
" lip-read the next word, “— "
owls
 — 
doing if they’re not bringing you news?” 
“Aha!” said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. “Get out of that 
"one, boy! As if we didn’t know yo"
u get all your news from those pesti-
lential birds!” 
Harry hesitated for a moment. It co
st him something to tell the 
"truth this time, even though his "
aunt and uncle could not possibly 
know how bad Harry fe
lt at admitting it. 
“The owls . . . aren’t
" bringing me news,” said Harry tonelessly. "
"“I don’t believe it,” said"
 Aunt Petunia at once. 
"“No more do I,” said Un"
cle Vernon forcefully. 
“We know you’re up to somethin
"g funny,” said Aunt Petunia. "
"“We’re not stupid, you kn"
"ow,” said Uncle Vernon. "
"“Well, "
that’s
" news to me,” said Harry, his temper rising, and before "
"the Dursleys could call him back, he"
" had wheeled about, crossed the  "
   7 "front lawn, stepped over the low ga"
"rden wall, and was "
striding off up 
the street. 
He was in trouble now and he knew
 it. He would have to face his 
aunt and uncle later and pay the pric
"e for his rudeness, but he did not "
care very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing mat-
ters on his mind. 
Harry was sure that the cracking 
noise had been made by someone 
Apparating or Disapparating. It
 was exactly the sound Dobby the 
house-elf made when he vanished into
 thin air. Was it possible that 
Dobby was here in Privet Drive? 
Could Dobby be following him right 
at this very moment? As this though
t occurred he wheeled around and 
"stared back down Privet Drive, but "
it appeared to be completely de-
serted again and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to 
become invisible. . . . 
"He walked on, hardly aware of th"
"e route he was taking, for he had "
pounded these streets so often lately 
that his feet carri
ed him to his fa-
vorite haunts automatically. Every 
few steps he glanced back over his 
shoulder. Someone magical had been 
near him as he lay among Aunt 
"Petunias dying begonias, he was sure "
of it. Why hadn’t 
they spoken to 
"him, why hadn’t they made contact, why were they hiding now? "
"And then, as his feeling of frustr"
"ation peaked, his "
certainty leaked 
away. 
Perhaps it hadn’t been a magical so
und after all. Perhaps he was so 
desperate for the tiniest sign of co
ntact from the world to which he 
belonged that he was simply overre
acting to perfectly ordinary noises. 
Could he be 
sure
 it hadn’t been the sound 
of something breaking in-
side a neighbor’s house? 
"Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation "
"in his stomach and, before he "
"knew it, the feeling of hopelessness "
that had plagued him all summer 
rolled over him once again. . . . 
Tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at five  
 8 o’clock so that he could pay the owl that delivered the 
Daily 
Prophet
 — but was there any point in 
continuing to take it? Harry 
merely glanced at the front page b
efore throwing it aside these days; 
when the idiots who ran the paper fi
nally realized that Voldemort was 
"back it would be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry "
cared about. 
"If he was lucky, there would also "
be owls carrying letters from his 
"best friends, Ron and Hermione, th"
ough any expectat
ion he had had 
that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed. 
“
"We can’t say much about you-know-what, obviously"
. . . .” “
We’ve been 
told not to say anything importan
t in case our letters go astray.
 . . .”
“
We’re quite busy but I can’t give you details here
. . . .” “
There’s a fair 
"amount going on, we’ll tell you "
everything when we see you
. . . .” 
But when were they going to s
ee him? Nobody seemed too both-
ered with a precise date. 
"Hermione had scribbled, "
“I expect we’ll be see-
ing you quite soon
"” inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As "
"far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione "
"and Ron were in the same place, pr"
esumably at Ron’s parents’ house. 
He could hardly bear to
 think of the pair of 
them having fun at the 
Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Dr
"ive. In fact, he was so angry at "
them that he had thrown both th
eir birthday presents of Honeydukes 
"chocolates away unopened, though he"
 had regretted this after eating 
the wilting salad Aunt Petunia had 
provided for dinner that night. 
"And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasn’t he, "
"Harry, busy? Hadn’t he proved him"
self capable of handling much 
more than they? Had they all forgo
tten what he had done? Hadn’t it 
been 
he
 who had entered that gravey
ard and watched Cedric being 
murdered and been tied to that 
tombstone and near
ly killed . . . ? 
"Don’t think about that, "
Harry told himself ster
nly for the hundredth 
time that summer. It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the grave-
"yard in his nightmares, without dwel"
ling on it in his waking moments 
too. 
   9 He turned a corner into Magnol
ia Crescent; halfway along he 
passed the narrow alleyway down the 
side of a garage where he had 
"first clapped eyes on his godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to under-"
stand how Harry was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as empty 
of proper news as Ron and Hermione’
"s, but at least they contained "
words of caution and consolatio
n instead of tantalizing hints: 
“
I know this must be frustrating for you
. . . .” “
Keep your nose clean 
and everything will be okay
. . . .” “
Be careful and don’t do anything 
rash
. . . .” 
"Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into "
"Magnolia Road, and headed toward the darkening play park, he had "
(by and large) done as Sirius advised;
 he had at least resisted the temp-
tation to tie his trunk 
to his broomstick and set off for the Burrow 
by himself. In fact Harry thought 
his behavior had been very good 
considering how frustrated and angry 
he felt at being stuck in Privet 
"Drive this long, reduced to hiding in "
flower beds in the hope of hear-
ing something that might point to
 what Lord Voldemort was doing. 
"Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man "
"who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped, "
attempted to commit the murder he
 had been convicted for in the 
"first place, then gone on the ru"
n with a stolen 
hippogriff. . . . 
Harry vaulted over the locked pa
rk gate and se
t off across the 
parched grass. The park was as em
pty as the surrounding streets. 
When he reached the swings he sank onto the only one that Dudley 
and his friends had not yet managed 
"to break, coiled one arm around "
"the chain, and stared moodily at th"
e ground. He would not be able to 
hide in the Dursleys’ flower bed ag
ain. Tomorrow he would have to 
"think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, he "
"had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night, "
because even when he escaped nightm
ares about Cedric he had unset-
tling dreams about long dark corridor
"s, all finishing in dead ends and "
"locked doors, which he supposed "
had something to do with the 
 10 trapped feeling he had when he was aw
ake. Often the old scar on his 
"forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that "
Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting any-
more. . . . In the past his scar hu
rting had warned that Voldemort was 
"getting stronger again, but now th"
at Voldemort was back they would 
probably remind him that its regula
r irritation was only to be ex-
pected. . . . Nothing to worr
y about . . . old news . . . 
The injustice of it all welled up insi
de him so that he wanted to yell 
with fury. If it hadn’t been for 
"him, nobody would even have known "
Voldemort was back! And his reward 
was to be stuck in Little Whing-
"ing for four solid weeks,"
" completely cut off from the magical world, "
reduced to squatting among dying be
gonias so that he could hear 
about water-skiing budgerigars! Ho
w could Dumbledore have forgot-
ten him so easily? Why had Ron an
d Hermione got together without 
inviting him along too? How much 
longer was he supposed to endure 
Sirius telling him to sit tight and be
 a good boy; or resist the tempta-
tion to write to the stupid 
Daily Prophet
 and point ou
t that Volde-
mort had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around in Harry’s 
"head, and his insides writhed with an"
"ger as a sultry, velvety night fell "
"around him, the air full of the smel"
"l of warm, dry grass and the only "
sound that of the low grumble of tr
affic on the road beyond the park 
railings. 
He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the 
sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up. The street-
lamps from the surrounding roads we
re casting a misty glow strong 
enough to silhouette a group of pe
ople making their way across the 
park. One of them was singing a lo
"ud, crude song. The others were "
laughing. A soft tickin
g noise came from seve
ral expensive racing 
bikes that they we
re wheeling along. 
Harry knew who those people were. 
The figure in front was unmis-
"takably his cousin, Dudley Dursle"
"y, wending his way home, accom-"
panied by his faithful gang. 
   11 "Dudley was as vast as ever, but a "
year’s hard dieting and the discov-
ery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique. As 
Uncle Vernon delightedl
"y told anyone who would listen, Dudley had "
recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Cham-
"pion of the Southeast. “The noble sport,” as Uncle Vernon called it, "
had made Dudley even more formidab
le than he had seemed to Harry 
in the primary school days when 
he had served as Dudley’s first 
punching bag. Harry was not remote
ly afraid of his cousin anymore 
but he still didn’t think that Dudley learning to punch harder and 
more accurately was cause for cele
bration. Neighborhood children all 
around were terrified of him — even more terrified than they were of 
"“that Potter boy,” who, they had been warned, was a hardened hooli-"
gan who attended St. Brutus’s Secu
re Center for Incurably Criminal 
Boys. 
Harry watched the dark figures cr
ossing the grass and wondered 
whom they had been beating up tonight. 
"Look round,"
 Harry found 
himself thinking as he watched them. 
Come on . . . look round . . . I’m 
sitting here all alone. 
. . . Come and have ago.
 . . . 
"If Dudley’s friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to "
"make a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then? He "
"wouldn’t want to lose face in front of the gang, but he’d be terrified of "
provoking Harry. . . . It would be
 really fun to watch Dudley’s 
"dilemma; to taunt him, watch him,"
 with him powerl
ess to respond 
". . . and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, Harry was ready — he "
had his wand . . . let them try . . . He
’d love to vent some of his frus-
tration on the boys who had 
once made his 
life hell — 
"But they did not turn around, they did not see him, they were al-"
most at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after them. 
. . . Seeking a fight was not a sm
art move. . . . He must not use 
magic. . . . He wo
uld be risking expu
lsion again. . . . 
Dudley’s gang’s voices died; they 
were out of sigh
"t, heading along "
Magnolia Road. 
 12 "There you go, Sirius,"
 Harry thought dully. 
Nothing rash. Kept my 
nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what you’d have done
 . . . 
He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon 
seemed to feel that whenever Dudley
 turned up was the right time to 
"be home, and anytime after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had "
threatened to lock Harry in the sh
ed if he came home after Dudley 
"again, so, stifling a yawn, still sc"
"owling, Harry set off toward the park "
gate. 
"Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, "
"was full of large, square houses "
"with perfectly manicured lawns, a"
"ll owned by large, square owners "
who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon’s. Harry preferred 
"Little Whinging by night, when "
the curtained windows made patches 
of jewel-bright colors in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing 
disapproving mutters about his “delinquent” appearance when he 
passed the householders. He walked 
"quickly, so that halfway along "
Magnolia Road Dudley’s gang came in
to view again; they were saying 
their farewells at the entrance to
 Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped 
into the shadow of a larg
e lilac tree and waited. 
"“. . . squealed like a pig, didn’t "
"he?” Malcolm was saying, to guffaws "
from the others. 
"“Nice right hook, Big D,” said Piers. "
“Same time tomorrow?” said Dudley. 
"“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said Gordon. "
"“See you then,” said Dudley. "
“Bye Dud!” 
"“See ya, Big D!” "
Harry waited for the rest of the gang
 to move on b
efore setting off 
again. When their voices had faded 
once more he headed around the 
corner into Magnolia Crescent and 
by walking very quickly he soon 
came within hailing distance of Du
"dley, who was stroll"
ing along at his 
"ease, humming tunelessly. "
"“Hey, Big D!” "
   13 Dudley turned. 
"“Oh,” he grunted. “It’s you.” "
“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?” said Harry. 
"“Shut it,” snarled Dudley, turning away again. "
"“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning "
and falling into step beside his 
cousin. “But you’ll always 
be Ickle Diddykins to me.” 
"“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley, "
whose ham-like hands had curled 
into fists. 
“Don’t the boys know that’s what your mum calls you?” 
“Shut your face.” 
“You don’t tell 
her
 to shut her face. Wh
at about ‘popkin’ and 
"‘Dinky Diddydums,’ can I use them then?” "
Dudley said nothing. The effort 
of keeping himself from hitting 
Harry seemed to be demand
ing all his self-control. 
“So who’ve you been beating up 
"tonight?” Harry asked, his grin "
fading. “Another ten-year-old? I kn
ow you did Mark 
Evans two nights 
ago —” 
"“He was asking for it,” snarled Dudley. "
“Oh yeah?” 
“He cheeked me.” 
“Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that’s been taught to walk on 
its hind legs? ’Cause that’s not 
"cheek, Dud, that’s"
 true . . .” 
A muscle was twitching in Dudley’s jaw. It gave Harry enormous 
satisfaction to know how furious 
he was making Dudley; he felt as 
though he was siphoning off his ow
"n frustration into his cousin, the "
only outlet he had. 
They turned right down the na
rrow alleyway where Harry had 
first seen Sirius and which form
ed a shortcut be
tween Magnolia 
Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It wa
s empty and much darker than the 
streets it linked because there were
 no streetlamps. Their footsteps 
were muffled between garage walls 
on one side and a high fence on 
the other. 
 14 “Think you’re a big man carrying th
"at thing, don’t you?” Dudley "
said after a few seconds. 
“What thing?” 
“That — that thin
g you’re hiding.” 
Harry grinned again. 
"“Not as stupid as you look, are yo"
"u, Dud? But I s’pose if you were, "
you wouldn’t be able 
to walk and talk at 
the same time. . . .” 
Harry pulled out his wand. He sa
w Dudley look sideways at it. 
"“You’re not allowed,” Dudley said "
at once. “I know you’re not. 
You’d get expelled from that
 freak school you go to.” 
“How d’you know they haven’
"t changed the rules, Big D?” "
"“They haven’t,” said Dudley, thou"
gh he didn’t sound completely 
convinced. Harry laughed softly. 
"“You haven’t got the guts to take me on without that thing, have "
you?” Dudley snarled. 
“Whereas you just need four mate
s behind you before you can beat 
up a ten-year-old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on 
about? How old wa
s your opponent? Seven? Eight?” 
“He was sixteen for your informatio
"n,” snarled Dudley, “and he was "
out cold for twenty minutes after I’
d finished with him and he was 
twice as heavy as you. You just wa
it till I tell Dad you had that thing 
out —” 
"“Running to Daddy now, are you? "
Is his ickle boxing champ fright-
ened of nasty Harry’s wand?” 
"“Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered Dudley. "
“This 
is
" night, Diddykins. That’s what "
we call it when it goes all 
dark like this.” 
“I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled. 
He had stopped walking. Harry sto
"pped too, staring at his cousin. "
From the little he could see of Dudl
"ey’s large face, he was wearing a "
strangely triumphant look. 
"“What d’you mean, I’m not brave in"
" bed?” said Harry, completely "
   15 nonplussed. “What — am I supposed 
to be frightened of pillows or 
something?” 
"“I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly. “Talking in your "
sleep. 
Moaning
.” 
“What d’you mean?” Harry said agai
"n, but there was a cold, plung-"
ing sensation in his stomach. He ha
d revisited the grav
eyard last night 
in his dreams. 
"Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a high-pitched, "
whimpering voice. “‘Don’t kill Cedric! Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s 
Cedric — your boyfriend?” 
“I — you’re lying —” said Harr
y automatically. But his mouth had 
gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn’t 
lying — how else would he know 
about Cedric? 
"“‘Dad! Help me, Dad! He’s goin"
"g to kill me, Da"
d! Boo-hoo!’” 
"“Shut up,” said Harry quietly. “Shut up, Dudley, I’m warning you!” "
"“‘Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! He’s killed "
"Cedric! Dad, help me! He’s going to —’ "
Don’t you point that thing at 
me
!” 
Dudley backed into the alley wall.
 Harry was pointing the wand di-
rectly at Dudley’s heart. Harry co
uld feel fourteen years’ hatred of 
"Dudley pounding in his veins — what wouldn’t he give to strike now, "
"to jinx Dudley so thoroughly he’d have to crawl home like an insect, "
"struck dumb, sprouting feelers — "
“Don’t ever talk about that ag
"ain,” Harry snarled. “D’you under-"
stand me?” 
“Point that thing 
somewhere else!” 
"“I said, "
do you understand me
?” 
“
Point it somewhere else
!” 
“DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?” 
“GET THAT THING AWAY FROM —” 
"Dudley gave an odd, shuddering "
"gasp, as though he had been "
doused in icy water. 
 16 Something had happened to the night. The star-strewn indigo sky 
was suddenly pitch-black and ligh
"tless — the stars, the moon, the "
misty streetlamps at either end of 
the alley had vanished. The distant 
grumble of cars and the whisper of
 trees had gone. The balmy evening 
"was suddenly piercingly, bitingly cold"
". They were surrounded by total, "
"impenetrable, silent darkness, as"
 though some giant hand had 
"dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding them. "
For a split second Harry though
t he had done magic without 
"meaning to, despite the fact that he"
’d been resisting as hard as he 
could — then his reason caught up with his senses — he didn’t have 
the power to turn off the stars. He 
"turned his head this way and that, "
"trying to see something, but the da"
rkness pressed on his eyes like a 
weightless veil. 
Dudley’s terrified voice 
broke in Harry’s ear. 
“W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!” 
“I’m not doing anything! Shut up and don’t move!” 
“I c-can’t see! I’ve g-gone blind! I —” 
“I said shut up!” 
"Harry stood stock-still, tu"
rning his sightless eyes
 left and right. The 
cold was so intense that he was 
shivering all over; goose bumps had 
"erupted up his arms, and the hairs on"
 the back of his neck were stand-
ing up — he opened his eyes to th
"eir fullest extent, staring blankly "
"around, unseeing . . . "
It was impossible. . . . They couldn
’t be here. . . . Not in Little 
Whinging . . . He strain
ed his ears. . . . He wo
uld hear them before 
he saw them. . . . 
“I’ll t-tell Dad!” Dudley whimpere
d. “W-where are you? What are 
you d-do — ?” 
“Will you shut up?” 
"Harry hissed, “I’m trying to lis —” "
But he fell silent. He had he
ard just the thing he had been 
dreading. 
"There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, some-"
   17 thing that was drawing 
"long, hoarse, rattling "
breaths. Harry felt a hor-
rible jolt of dread as
 he stood trembling in
 the freezing air. 
“C-cut it out! Stop 
doing it! I’ll h-hit 
"you, I swear I will!” "
"“Dudley, shut —” "
WHAM
! 
A fist made contact with the side
" of Harry’s head, lifting Harry off "
his feet. Small white lights popped in
 front of Harry’s eyes; for the sec-
ond time in an hour he felt as th
ough his head had been cleaved in 
two; next moment he had landed ha
"rd on the ground, and his wand "
had flown out of his hand. 
"“You moron, Dudley!” Harry yelled, "
"his eyes watering with pain, as "
"he scrambled to his hands and knees,"
 now feeling around frantically in 
the blackness. He heard Dudley bl
"undering away, hitting the alley "
"fence, stumbling. "
"“DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU’RE RUNNING RIGHT AT "
IT!” 
There was a horrible squealing 
"yell, and Dudley’s footsteps "
"stopped. At the same moment, Harry "
felt a creeping c
hill behind him 
that could mean
 only one thing. There was more than one. 
"“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU "
"DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! "
Wand!” Harry muttered franti-
"cally, his hands flying over the grou"
nd like spiders. “Where’s — wand 
— come on — 
Lumos
!” 
"He said the spell automatically, de"
sperate for light to help him in 
his search — and to his disbelieving 
"relief, light flared inches from his "
"right hand — the wand tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scram-"
"bled to his feet, "
and turned around. 
His stomach turned over. 
"A towering, hooded figure was "
"gliding smoothly toward him, "
"hovering over the ground, no feet "
"or face visible beneath its robes, "
sucking on the ni
ght as it came. 
"Stumbling backward, Ha"
rry raised his wand. 
 18 “
Expecto Patronum
!” 
A silvery wisp of vapor shot from
 the tip of the wand and the de-
"mentor slowed, but the spell hadn’t "
worked properly; tripping over his 
"feet, Harry retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, "
panic fogging his brain — 
concentrate
 — 
"A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hand"
s slid from inside the dementor’s 
"robes, reaching for him. A ru"
shing noise filled Harry’s ears. 
“
Expecto Patronum
!” 
His voice sounded dim and distant. . . . Another wisp of silver 
"smoke, feebler than the last, drifte"
d from the wand — he couldn’t do 
"it anymore, he couldn’t work the spell — "
There was laughter inside his ow
"n head, shrill, high-pitched laugh-"
ter. . . . He could smell the dement
"or’s putrid, death-cold breath, fill-"
"ing his own lungs, drowning him — "
Think
 . . .
 something happy
. . . . 
But there was no happiness in him. 
. . . The dementor’s icy fingers 
were closing on his throat — the 
high-pitched laughter was growing 
"louder and louder, and a voic"
e spoke inside his head — “
"Bow to death, "
Harry
. . . . 
It might even be painless
. . . . 
I would not know
. . . . 
I have 
never died.
 . . .” 
He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again — 
And their faces burst clearly in
to his mind as he fought for 
breath — 
“
EXPECTO PATRONUM
!” 
An enormous silver stag erupted 
from the tip of Harry’s wand; its 
antlers caught the dementor in the 
place where the heart should have 
"been; it was thrown backward, weight"
"less as darkness, and as the stag "
"charged, the dementor swooped"
" away, batlike and defeated. "
“THIS WAY!” Harry shouted at 
"the stag. Wheeling around, he "
"sprinted down the alleyway, holdin"
g the lit wand aloft. “DUDLEY? 
DUDLEY!” 
He had run barely a dozen steps 
when he reached them: Dudley 
"was curled on the ground, his arms "
clamped over his face; a second de-
   19 "mentor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy "
"hands, prizing them slowly, almost "
"lovingly apart, lowering its hooded "
head toward Dudley’s face as 
though about to kiss him. . . . 
"“GET IT!” Harry bellowed, and with"
" a rushing, roaring sound, the "
silver stag he had conjured came galloping back past him. The de-
mentor’s eyeless face was barely an 
inch from Dudley’s when the silver 
antlers caught it; the thing was thro
"wn up into the air and, like its "
"fellow, it soared away and was abso"
rbed into the darkness. The stag 
cantered to the end of the alleyway
 and dissolved into silver mist. 
"Moon, stars, and streetlamps burs"
t back into life. A warm breeze 
swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighboring gardens and the mun-
dane rumble of cars in Magnolia Cr
escent filled the air again. Harry 
"stood quite still, all his s"
"enses vibrating, taking in"
 the abrupt return to 
normality. After a moment
 he became aware that his T-shirt was stick-
ing to him; he was drenched in sweat. 
He could not believe what ha
d just happened. Dementors 
"here,"
 in 
Little Whinging . . . 
"Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking. "
Harry bent down to see whether he wa
"s in a fit state to stand up, but "
"then heard loud, running footsteps "
behind him; instinctively raising 
"his wand again, he spun on hi"
s heel to face the newcomer. 
"Mrs. Figg, their batty old neighbor,"
 came panting into sight. Her 
grizzled gray hair was escaping fr
"om its hairnet, a clanking string "
shopping bag was swinging from her 
"wrist, and her feet were halfway "
out of her tartan carpet slippers
. Harry made to stow his wand hur-
"riedly out of sight, but — "
"“Don’t put it away, idiot boy!” "
she shrieked. “What if there are 
"more of them around? Oh, I’m going to "
kill
 Mundungus Fletcher!” 
hat?” said Harry blankly. 
"“He left!” said Mrs. Figg, wringing her hands. “Left to see "
someone about a batch of cauldrons th
at fell off the back of a broom! 
I told him I’d flay him alive if he 
"went, and now look! Dementors! It’s "
just lucky I put Mr. Tibbies on the case! But we haven’t got time to 
"stand around! Hurry, now, we’ve got "
"to get you back! Oh, the trouble "
this is going to cause! I will 
kill
 him!” 
“But —” 
The revelation that his batty ol
d cat-obsessed neighbor knew what 
dementors were was almo
st as big a shock to Harry as meeting two of 
them down the alleyway
. “You’re — you’re a 
witch
?” 
"“I’m a Squib, as Mundungus knows "
"full well, so how on earth was "
I supposed to help you fight off dementors? He left you completely 
without cover when I 
warned 
him —” 
“This bloke Mundungus has been 
following me? Hang on — it 
was 
him
! He Disapparated from the front of my house!” 
"“Yes, yes, "
yes
", but luckily I’d stationed Mr"
. Tibbies under a car just 
"in case, and Mr. Tibbies came and "
"warned me, but by the time I got "
W 
   21 "to your house you’d gone — and now — oh, "
what’s
 Dumbledore go-
ing to say? You!” she shrieked at Du
"dley, still supine on the alley floor. "
"“Get your fat bottom off the ground, quick!” "
“You know Dumbledore?” said
" Harry, staring at her. "
"“Of course I know Dumbledore, "
who doesn’t know Dumbledore? 
But come 
on
" — I’ll be no help if they come back, I’ve never so much "
as Transfigured a teabag —” 
"She stooped down, seized one of Dudley’s massive arms in her wiz-"
"ened hands, and tugged. "
“Get 
"up,"
" you useless lump, get "
up
!” 
But Dudley either could not or 
would not move. He was still on 
"the ground, trembling and ashen-face"
"d, his mouth shut very tight. "
“I’ll do it.” Harry took hold of Du
dley’s arm and heaved: With an 
enormous effort he managed to hoist Dudley to his feet. Dudley 
seemed to be on the point of fainti
ng: His small eyes were rolling in 
their sockets and sweat was beading 
his face; the mome
nt Harry let go 
of him he swayed dangerously. 
“Hurry up!” said Mrs.
 Figg hysterically. 
Harry pulled one of Dudley’s massive arms around his own shoul-
"ders and dragged him toward the road, sagging slightly under his "
weight. Mrs. Figg tottered along in
" front of them, peering anxiously "
around the corner. 
"“Keep your wand out,” she told "
"Harry, as they entered Wisteria "
Walk. “Never mind the Statute of Secr
"ecy now, there’s going to be hell "
"to pay anyway, we might as well be hang"
ed for a dragon as an egg. Talk 
about the Reasonable Restriction of
 Underage Sorcery . . . This was 
exactly
 what Dumbledore was afraid of — what’s that at the end of the 
"street? Oh, it’s just Mr. Prentice. . "
". . Don’t put your wand away, boy, "
don’t I keep tellin
g you I’m no use?” 
It was not easy to hold a wand st
eady and carry Dudley along at the 
"same time. Harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but "
Dudley seemed to have lost all de
sire for independent movement. He 
 22 "was slumped on Harry’s shoulder, his"
 large feet drag
ging along the 
ground. 
"“Why didn’t you tell me you’re a Squib?” Harry asked Mrs. Figg, "
panting with the effort to keep walk
ing. “All those times I came round 
your house — why didn’t you say anything?” 
“Dumbledore’s orders. I was to keep
 an eye on you but not say any-
"thing, you were too young. I’m sorry "
"I gave you such a miserable time, "
but the Dursleys would never have le
t you come if they’d thought you 
"enjoyed it. It wasn’t easy, you know"
". . . . But oh my word,” she said "
"tragically, wringing her hands on"
"ce more, “when Dumbledore hears "
about this — how could Mundungus ha
"ve left, he was supposed to be "
on duty until midnight — 
where is he
? How am I going to tell Dum-
bledore what’s happened
", I can’t Apparate —” "
"“I’ve got an owl, you can borro"
"w her,” Harry groaned, wondering "
whether his spine was going to 
snap under Dudley’s weight. 
"“Harry, you don’t understand! Dumbledore will need to act as "
"quickly as possible, the Ministry have"
 their own ways of detecting un-
"derage magic, they’ll know al"
"ready, you mark my words —” "
“But I was getting rid of dementor
"s, I had to use magic — they’re "
going to be more worried what dem
entors were doing floating around 
"Wisteria Walk, surely?” "
"“Oh my dear, I wish it were so but I’m afraid — MUNDUNGUS "
"FLETCHER, I AM GOING TO KILL YOU!” "
There was a loud 
crack
 and a strong smell 
of mingled drink and 
"stale tobacco filled the air as a squat, unshaven man in a tattered over-"
coat materialized right in front of 
"them. He had short bandy legs, long "
"straggly ginger hair, "
and bloodshot baggy eyes 
that gave him the dole-
ful look of a basset hound; he was 
also clutching a silvery bundle that 
Harry recognized at once as
 an Invisibility Cloak. 
"“’S’ up, Figgy?” he said, staring "
from Mrs. Figg to Harry and Dud-
ley. “What ’appened to
 staying undercover?” 
   23 “I’ll give you undercover!” cried Mrs. Figg. “
"Dementors,"
" you useless, "
skiving sneak thief!” 
"“Dementors?” repeated Mundungus, aghast. “Dementors here?” "
"“Yes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here!” shrieked "
Mrs. Figg. “Dementors attack
ing the boy on your watch!” 
"“Blimey,” said Mundungus weakly, looking from Mrs. Figg to "
Harry and back again.
" “Blimey, I . . .” "
“And you off buying stolen cauldrons! Didn’t I tell you not to go? 
Didn’t I
?” 
"“I — well, I —” Mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable. “It . . . "
it was a very good business
" opportunity, see . . .” "
Mrs. Figg raised the arm from wh
ich her string bag dangled and 
whacked Mundungus around the face
 and neck with it; judging by 
the clanking noise it made 
it was full of cat food. 
"“Ouch — gerroff — gerroff, you mad "
old bat! Someone’s gotta tell 
Dumbledore!” 
"“Yes — they — have!” yelled Mrs. Figg, still swinging the bag of "
cat food at every bit of Mundungu
s she could reach. “And — it — 
had — better — be — you — and 
— you — can — tell — him — 
why — you — weren’t — there — to — help!” 
"“Keep your ’airnet on!” said Mundungus, his arms over his head, "
"cowering. “I’m going, I’m going!” "
And with another loud 
"crack,"
 he vanished. 
“I hope Dumbledore 
murders
 him!” said Mrs. Figg furiously. “Now 
come 
"on,"
" Harry, what are you waiting for?” "
Harry decided not to waste his rema
ining breath on pointing out 
that he could barely walk under Dudley’s bulk. He gave the semicon-
scious Dudley a heave 
and staggered onward. 
"“I’ll take you to the door,” said Mrs."
" Figg, as they turned into Privet "
"Drive. “Just in case there are more of them around. . . . Oh my word, "
what a catastrophe . . . and you had to
 fight them off yo
urself . . . and  
 24 Dumbledore said we were to keep yo
u from doing magic at all costs. 
". . . Well, it’s no good crying over spilled potion, I suppose . . . but the "
cat’s among the pi
xies now . . .” 
"“So,” Harry panted, “Dumbledore’"
s . . . been having . . . me 
followed?” 
"“Of course he has,” said Mrs. Fi"
gg impatiently. “Did you expect 
him to let you wander around on 
your own after what happened in 
"June? Good Lord, boy, they told me you were intelligent. . . . Right "
". . . get inside and stay there,” she said as they reached number four. “I "
expect someone will 
be in touch with you soon enough.” 
“What are you going to do?
” asked Harry quickly. 
"“I’m going straight home,” said Mr"
"s. Figg, staring around the dark "
street and shuddering. “I’ll need to
 wait for more instructions. Just 
stay in the house. Good night.” 
"“Hang on, don’t go yet!"
 I want to know —” 
But Mrs. Figg had already set off at 
"a trot, carpet slippers flopping, "
string bag clanking. 
“Wait!” Harry shouted after her; he
 had a million questions to ask 
anyone who was in contact with 
Dumbledore; but within seconds 
Mrs. Figg was swallowed by the da
"rkness. Scowling, Harry readjusted "
Dudley on his shoulder and made 
"his slow, painful way up number "
four’s garden path. 
The hall light was on. 
Harry stuck his wand ba
ck inside the waist-
"band of his jeans, rang the bell, and watched Aunt Petunia’s outline "
"grow larger and larger, oddly distor"
ted by the rippling glass in the 
front door. 
"“Diddy! About time too, I was getting quite — quite — "
"Diddy, "
what’s the matter
?” 
Harry looked sideways at Dudley 
and ducked out from under his 
arm just in time. Dudley swayed fo
"r a moment on the spot, his face "
"pale green, then he op"
ened his mouth at last 
and vomited all over the 
doormat. 
   25 "“DIDDY! Diddy, what’s the matter with you? Vernon? VERNON!” "
Harry’s uncle came galumphing out 
"of the living room, walrus mus-"
tache blowing hither and thither as 
it always did when he was agitated. 
He hurried forward to help Aunt
 Petunia negotia
te a weak-kneed 
Dudley over the threshold while avoidi
ng stepping in the pool of sick. 
"“He’s ill, Vernon!” "
"“What is it, son? What’s happen"
ed? Did Mrs. Polkiss give you 
something foreign for tea?” 
"“Why are you all covered in dirt, "
darling? Have you been lying on 
the ground?” 
“Hang on — you haven’t been
" mugged, have you, son?” "
Aunt Petunia screamed. 
"“Phone the police, Vernon! Phone the police! Diddy, darling, speak "
to Mummy! What di
d they do to you?” 
"In all the kerfuffle, nobody seemed to have noticed Harry, which "
suited him perfectly. He managed to 
slip inside just before Uncle Ver-
non slammed the door and while the Dursleys made their noisy 
progress down the hall toward the ki
"tchen, Harry moved carefully and "
quietly toward the stairs. 
"“Who did it, son? Give us name"
"s. We’ll get them, don’t worry.” "
"“Shh! He’s trying to say something, Vernon! What is it, Diddy? Tell "
Mummy!” 
Harry’s foot was on the bottommo
st stair when Dudley found his 
voice. 
“
Him.
” 
"Harry froze, foot on the stair, "
"face screwed up, braced for the "
explosion. 
“BOY! COME HERE!” 
"With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry removed his foot "
slowly from the stair and tu
rned to follow the Dursleys. 
The scrupulously clean kitchen had 
an oddly unreal glitter after the 
darkness outside. Aunt Petunia was us
hering Dudley into a chair; he 
 26 was still very green and clammy look
ing. Uncle Vernon was standing 
"in front of the draining board, "
"glaring at Harry through tiny, nar-"
rowed eyes. 
“What have you done to
 my son?” he said in a menacing growl. 
"“Nothing,” said Harry, knowing pe"
rfectly well that Uncle Vernon 
wouldn’t believe him. 
"“What did he do to you, Diddy?” Au"
nt Petunia said in a quavering 
"voice, now sponging sick from the front of Dudley’s leather jacket. "
"“Was it — was it you-know-what, darling? Did he use — his "
thing
?” 
"Slowly, tremulously,"
 Dudley nodded. 
"“I didn’t!” Harry said sharply, as"
 Aunt Petunia let out a wail and 
Uncle Vernon raised his fists. “I 
"didn’t do anything to him, it wasn’t "
"me, it was —” "
But at that precise moment a sc
reech owl swooped in through the 
kitchen window. Narrowly missing the 
"top of Uncle Vernon’s head, it "
"soared across the kitchen, droppe"
d the large parchment envelope it 
was carrying in its beak at Harry’s feet
", and turned gracefully, the tips "
"of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside "
again and off acro
ss the garden. 
"“OWLS!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in his tem-"
ple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut. “OWLS 
AGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE 
ANY MORE OWLS IN MY 
HOUSE!” 
But Harry was already ripping open 
the envelope and pulling out 
"the letter inside, his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his "
Adam’s apple. 
"Dear Mr. Potter, "
We have received intelligenc
e that you performed the Pa-
tronus Charm at twenty-three mi
nutes past nine this evening 
in a Muggle-inhabited area and 
in the presence of a Muggle. 
The severity of this breach of the Decree for the Reason-
   27 able Restriction of Underage So
rcery has resulted in your ex-
pulsion from Hogwarts School 
of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
Ministry representatives will be ca
lling at your place of resi-
dence shortly to destroy your wand. 
As you have already received
 an official warning for a 
previous offense under section 
13 of the International Con-
federation of Wizards’ Statute of 
"Secrecy, we regr"
et to inform 
you that your presence is requir
ed at a disciplinary hearing at 
the Ministry of Magic at 9 
a.m.
 on August 12th. 
"Hoping you are well, "
"Yours sincerely, "
improper use of magic office 
Ministry of Magic
Harry read the letter through twice.
 He was only vaguely aware of 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia talk
ing in the vicinity. Inside his 
"head, all was icy and numb. One fa"
ct had penetrated his conscious-
ness like a paralyzing dart. He was 
expelled from Hogwarts. It was all 
over. He was never going back. 
He looked up at the Dursleys. 
"Uncle Vernon was purple-faced, "
"shouting, his fists still raised; Aunt"
 Petunia had her arms around Dud-
"ley, who was retching again. "
Harry’s temporarily stupefied 
brain seemed to reawaken. 
Ministry 
representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy 
your wand.
 There was only one thing for it. He would have to run — 
"now. Where he was going to go, Harry didn’t know, but he was certain "
of one thing: At Hogwarts or outs
"ide it, he needed his wand. In an "
"almost dreamlike state, he pulled hi"
s wand out and turned to leave the 
kitchen. 
 28 “Where d’you think you’re goin
g?” yelled Uncle Vernon. When 
"Harry didn’t reply, he pounded ac"
ross the kitchen to block the door-
way into the hall. “I haven’
"t finished with you, boy!” "
"“Get out of the way,” "
said Harry quietly. 
“You’re going to stay here 
and explain how my son —” 
“If you don’t get out of the way I’
"m going to jinx you,” said Harry, "
raising the wand. 
“You can’t pull that one on me!”
 snarled Uncle Vernon. “I know 
you’re not allowed to use it outside 
that madhouse you call a school!” 
“The madhouse has chucked me 
"out,” said Harry. “So I can do "
whatever I like. You’ve got three seconds. One — two —” 
A resounding 
CRACK
 filled the kitchen; 
"Aunt Petunia screamed, "
"Uncle Vernon yelled and ducked, but for the third time that night "
Harry was staring for the source of 
a disturbance he had not made. He 
spotted it at once: A dazed and ru
ffled-looking barn owl was sitting 
"outside on the kitchen sill, having"
 just collided with the closed 
window. 
Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s anguishe
d yell of “OWLS!” Harry crossed 
the room at a run and wrenched the window open again. The owl 
"stuck out its leg, to which a small "
"roll of parchment was tied, shook its "
"feathers, and took off "
the moment Harry had pu
lled off the letter. 
"Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the "
"second message, which was writ-"
ten very hastily and blotchily in black ink. 
Harry 
— 
Dumbledore’s just arrived at th
"e Ministry, and he’s trying to "
sort it all out. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND 
UNCLE’S HOUSE. DO NOT 
DO ANY MORE MAGIC. 
DO NOT SURRENDER YOUR WAND.
   29 Dumbledore was trying to sort it al
l out. . . . What did that mean? 
How much power did Dumbledore have
 to override the Ministry of 
Magic? Was there a chance that he
 might be allowed back to Hog-
"warts, then? A small shoot of hope "
"burgeoned in Harry’s chest, almost "
immediately strangled by
 panic — how was he su
pposed to refuse to 
surrender his wand without doing magi
c? He’d have to duel with the 
"Ministry representatives, and if he di"
"d that, he’d be lucky to escape "
"Azkaban, let alone expulsion. "
His mind was racing. . . . He coul
d run for it and risk being cap-
"tured by the Ministry, or stay put an"
d wait for them to find him here. 
He was much more tempted by the 
"former course, but he knew that "
Mr. Weasley had his best interests at 
"heart . . . and, after all, Dumble-"
dore had sorted out 
much worse than this before. . . . 
"“Right,” Harry said, “I’ve ch"
"anged my mind, I’m staying.” "
He flung himself down at the kitc
hen table and faced Dudley and 
Aunt Petunia. The Dursleys appe
ared taken aback at his abrupt 
change of mind. Aunt Petunia glan
ced despairingly at Uncle Vernon. 
The vein in Uncle Vernon’s purple temple was throbbing worse than 
ever. 
“Who are all these ruddy owls from?” he growled. 
"“The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,” said "
Harry calmly; he was straining his ears to catch noises outside in case 
the Ministry representatives were a
"pproaching, and it was easier and "
quieter to answer Uncle Vernon’s qu
estions than to ha
ve him start rag-
ing and bellowing. “The second one wa
"s from my friend Ron’s dad, he "
works at the Ministry.” 
“
Ministry of Magic
?” bellowed Uncle Vernon
. “People like you in 
government
"? Oh this explains everything,"
" everything, no wonder the "
country’s going to the dogs. . . .” 
"When Harry did not respond, Uncle "
"Vernon glared at him, then "
"spat, “And why have you been expelled?” "
 30 “Because I did magic.” 
"“AHA!” roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his fist down on the top of "
"the fridge, which sprang open; several of Dudley’s low-fat snacks top-"
pled out and burst on th
e floor. “So you admit it! 
What did you do to 
Dudley
?” 
"“Nothing,” said Harry, slightly "
less calmly. “That wasn’t me —” 
“Was
",” muttered Dudley unexpect"
"edly, and Uncle Vernon and "
Aunt Petunia instantly made flapping
 gestures at Harry to quiet him 
while they both bent
 low over Dudley. 
"“Go on, son,” said"
" Uncle Vernon, “what did he do?” "
"“Tell us, darling,” whis"
pered Aunt Petunia. 
"“Pointed his wand at me,” Dudley mumbled. "
"“Yeah, I did, but I di"
dn’t use —” Harry bega
"n angrily, but . . . "
“SHUT UP!” roared Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia in unison. 
"“Go on, son,” repeated Uncle Vernon, mustache blowing about "
furiously. 
"“All dark,” Dudley said hoarsely"
", shuddering. “Everything dark. "
And then I h-heard . . . 
things.
 Inside m-my head . . .” 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia ex
changed looks of
 utter horror. 
If their least favorite 
thing in the world was ma
"gic, closely followed "
"by neighbors who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban, "
people who heard voices were defini
tely in the bottom ten. They ob-
viously thought Dudley was losing his mind. 
“What sort of things did you hear
", popkin?” breathed Aunt Petu-"
"nia, very white-faced and "
with tears in her eyes. 
But Dudley seemed incapable of 
saying. He shu
ddered again and 
"shook his large blond head, and desp"
ite the sense of numb dread that 
had settled on Harry since 
"the arrival of the first owl, he felt a certain "
curiosity. Dementors caused a person
 to relive the worst moments of 
"their life. . . . What would spoiled,"
" pampered, bullying Dudley have "
been forced to hear? 
"“How come you fell over, son?” said Uncle Vernon in an unnatu-"
   31 "rally quiet voice, the kind of voice "
he would adopt at the bedside of a 
very ill person. 
"“T-tripped,” said Dudley shakily. “And then —” "
He gestured at his massive chest.
 Harry understood: Dudley was re-
membering the clammy cold that fi
lled the lungs as hope and happi-
ness were sucked out of you. 
"“Horrible,” croaked Dudley"
. “Cold. Really cold.” 
"“Okay,” said Uncle Vernon in a vo"
"ice of forced calm, while Aunt "
Petunia laid an anxious hand on Du
dley’s forehead to
 feel his temper-
"ature. “What happened then, Dudders?” "
“Felt . . . felt . . . felt . . 
. as if. . . as if . . .” 
“As if you’d never be happy agai
"n,” Harry supplied tonelessly. "
"“Yes,” Dudley whispered, still trembling. "
"“So,” said Uncle Vernon, voice rest"
ored to full and considerable 
volume as he straightened up. “So yo
u put some crackpot spell on my 
son so he’d hear voices and beli
"eve he was — was doomed to misery, "
"or something, did you?” "
“How many times do I have to te
"ll you?” said Harry, temper and "
voice rising together. “
It wasn’t me
! It was a couple of dementors!” 
“A couple of— what’s this codswallop?” 
"“De — men — tors,” said Harry "
slowly and clearly. “Two of 
them.” 
“And what the ruddy hell are dementors?” 
"“They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban,” said Aunt Petunia. "
Two seconds’ ringing silence foll
owed these words and then Aunt 
Petunia clapped her hand over her mo
uth as though she had let slip a 
disgusting swear word. Uncle Vern
on was goggling at her. Harry’s 
brain reeled. Mrs. Figg
 was one thing — but 
Aunt Petunia
? 
“How d’you know that?” he
" asked her, astonished. "
Aunt Petunia looked quite appalled
 with herself. She glanced at 
"Uncle Vernon in fearful apology, th"
en lowered her hand slightly to re-
veal her horsey teeth. 
 32 “I heard — that awful boy — telling 
her
" about them — years ago,” "
she said jerkily. 
"“If you mean my mum and dad, "
why don’t you use their names?” 
"said Harry loudly, but Aunt Petuni"
a ignored him. She seemed horri-
bly flustered. 
Harry was stunned. Ex
cept for one outburst
" years ago, in the "
course of which Aunt Petunia had 
screamed that Harry’s mother had 
"been a freak, he had never heard "
her mention her sister. He was as-
tounded that she had remembered t
his scrap of information about the 
"magical world for so long, when sh"
e usually put all her energies into 
pretending it didn’t exist. 
"Uncle Vernon opened his mouth, cl"
"osed it again, opened it once "
"more, shut it, then, apparently st"
"ruggling to remember how to talk, "
"opened it for a third time and croaked, “So — so — they — er — "
"they — er — they actually exist, "
do they — er — dementy-whatsits?” 
Aunt Petunia nodded. 
Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Pe
tunia to Dudley to Harry as if 
hoping somebody was going to shou
"t “April Fool!” When nobody did, "
"he opened his mouth yet again, but "
was spared the struggle to find 
"more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening, which "
zoomed through the still-open window
 like a feathery cannonball and 
landed with a clatter on the kitch
"en table, causing "
all three of the 
Dursleys to jump with fright. Harry tore a second official-looking en-
velope from the owl’s beak and 
ripped it open as the owl swooped 
back out into the night. 
“Enough — effing — 
owls
 . . .” muttered Uncle Vernon distract-
"edly, stomping over to the window"
 and slamming it
 shut again. 
"Dear Mr. Potter, "
Further to our letter of a
pproximately twenty-two minutes 
"ago, the Ministry of Magic has re"
vised its decision to destroy 
your wand forthwith. You may 
retain your wand until your 
   33 "disciplinary hearing on 12th August, at which time an official "
decision will
 be taken. 
Following discussions with the Headmaster of Hogwarts 
School of Witchcraft and Wiza
"rdry, the Ministry has agreed "
that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that 
time. You should therefore consider yourself suspended from 
school pending further inquiries. 
"With best wishes, "
"Yours sincerely, "
improper use of magic office 
Ministry of Magic
Harry read this letter through thre
e times in quick succession. The 
miserable knot in his ch
est loosened slightly at the thought that he 
"was not definitely expelled, though"
 his fears were by no means ban-
ished. Everything seemed to hang 
on this hearing on the twelfth of 
August. 
"“Well?” said Uncle Vernon, reca"
lling Harry to his surroundings. 
“What now? Have they sentenced yo
u to anything? Do your lot have 
the death penalty?” he added as a hopeful afterthought. 
"“I’ve got to go to a hearing,” said Harry. "
“And they’ll sentence you there?” 
“I suppose so.” 
"“I won’t give up hope, then,”"
 said Uncle Vernon nastily. 
"“Well, if that’s all,” "
"said Harry, getting"
 to his feet. He was desperate 
"to be alone, to think, perhaps to "
"send a letter to Ron, Hermione, or "
Sirius. 
"“NO, IT RUDDY WELL IS NOT ALL!” bellowed Uncle Vernon. "
“SIT BACK DOWN!” 
 34 “What 
now
?” said Harry impatiently. 
“DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon. “I
 want to know exactly what 
happened to my son!” 
"“FINE!” yelled Harry, and in his "
"temper, red and gold sparks shot "
"out of the end of his wand, still cl"
utched in his hand. All three Durs-
"leys flinched, looking terrified. "
“Dudley and I were in the alleyw
ay between Magnolia Crescent 
"and Wisteria Walk,” said Harry, spea"
"king fast, fighting to control his "
"temper. “Dudley thought he’d be smart with me, I pulled out my "
wand but didn’t use it. Then 
two dementors turned up —” 
“But what ARE dementoids?” as
ked Uncle Vernon furiously. 
“What do they DO?” 
“I told you — they suck all the 
"happiness out of you,” said Harry, "
"“and if they get the chance, they kiss you —” "
“Kiss you?” said Uncle Vernon
", his eyes popping slightly. "
“Kiss
 you?” 
“It’s what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth.” 
Aunt Petunia uttered a soft scream. 
“His 
soul
? They didn’t take — 
he’s still got his —” 
She seized Dudley by the shoulder
"s and shook him, as though test-"
ing to see whether she could hear hi
s soul rattling around inside him. 
"“Of course they didn’t get his soul, you’d know if they had,” said "
"Harry, exasperated. "
"“Fought ’em off, did you, son?” sa"
"id Uncle Vernon loudly, with the "
appearance of a man struggling to br
ing the conversation back onto a 
plane he understood. “Gave ’e
m the old one-tw
"o, did you?” "
“You can’t give a dementor 
"the old one-two,"
” said Harry through 
clenched teeth. 
"“Why’s he all right, then?” blustered Uncle Vernon. “Why isn’t he "
"all empty, then?” "
“Because I used the Patronus —” 
WHOOSH
". With a clattering, a whirring of wings, and a soft fall of "
"dust, a fourth owl came"
 shooting out of th
e kitchen fireplace. 
   35 "“FOR GOD’S SAKE!” roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps "
"of hair out of his mustache, somet"
hing he hadn’t been driven to in a 
long time. “I WILL NOT HA
"VE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT "
"TOLERATE THIS, I TELL YOU!” "
But Harry was already pulling a ro
ll of parchment from the owl’s 
leg. He was so convinced that this 
"letter had to be from Dumbledore, "
explaining everything — the deme
"ntors, Mrs. Figg, what the Min-"
"istry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything "
out — that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sir-
ius’s handwriting. Ignoring Uncle 
Vernon’s ongoing rant about owls 
and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most re-
"cent owl took off back up the chimney, Harry read Sirius’s message. "
Arthur’s just told us what’s happened. 
"Don’t leave the house again, whatever you do.  "
Harry found this such an inadequa
te response to everything that 
had happened tonight that he tur
"ned the piece of parchment over, "
looking for the rest of the lett
"er, but there was nothing there. "
And now his temper was rising again. Wasn’t 
anybody
 going to say 
“well done” for fighting off two de
mentors single-handedly? Both Mr. 
Weasley and Sirius were acting as though he’d misbehaved and they 
were saving their tellings-off unti
l they could ascertain how much 
damage had been done. 
"“— a peck, I mean, pack of owls "
shooting in and out of my house 
and I won’t have it
", boy, I won’t —” "
"“I can’t stop the owls coming,” Harry snapped, crushing Sirius’s let-"
ter in his fist. 
“I want the truth about what 
happened tonight!” barked Uncle 
Vernon. “If it was demenders who 
"hurt Dudley, how come you’ve "
been expelled? You did you-know
"-what, you’ve admitted it!” "
"Harry took a deep, steadying brea"
th. His head was beginning to 
 36 ache again. He wanted more than 
"anything to get out of the kitchen, "
away from the Dursleys. 
“I did the Patronus Charm to get 
rid of the dement
"ors,” he said, "
forcing himself to remain calm. “It’
s the only thing that works against 
them.” 
“But what were dementoids 
doing
 in Little Whinging?” said Uncle 
Vernon in tones of outrage. 
"“Couldn’t tell you,” said Harry wearily. “No idea.” "
His head was pounding in the glar
e of the strip lighting now. His 
"anger was ebbing away. He felt drained, exhausted. The Dursleys were "
all staring at him. 
"“It’s you,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. “It’s got something to do "
"with you, boy, I know it. Why else "
would they turn up here? Why else 
would they be down that alleyway? You’ve got to be the only — the 
only —” Evidently he couldn’t bring himself to say the word “wizard.” 
“The only 
you-know-what
 for miles.” 
“I don’t know why they
 were here. . . .” 
But at these words of Uncle Ve
"rnon’s, Harry’s exhausted brain "
ground back into action. Why 
had
 the dementors come to Little 
Whinging? How 
could
 it be coincidence that 
they had arrived in the 
alleyway where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the Ministry of 
Magic lost control of the dementor
"s, had they deserted Azkaban and "
"joined Voldemort, as Dumbledore had predicted they would? "
“These demembers guard some weirdos’ prison?” said Uncle Ver-
"non, lumbering in the wake of"
 Harry’s train of thought. 
"“Yes,” said Harry. "
"If only his head would stop hurting, if only he could just leave the "
kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and 
think.
 . . . 
“Oho! They were coming to arrest
" you!” said Uncle Vernon, with "
the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion. 
"“That’s it, isn’t it, boy? You’"
re on the run from the law!” 
   37 "“Of course I’m not,” said Harry, "
shaking his head as though to 
"scare off a fly, his "
mind racing now. 
“Then why — ?” 
"“He must have sent them,” said"
" Harry quietly, more to himself "
than to Uncle Vernon. 
“What’s that? Who must
 have sent them?” 
"“Lord Voldemort,” said Harry. "
He registered dimly how strange 
"it was that the Dursleys, who "
"flinched, winced, and squawked if they heard words like “wizard,” "
"“magic,” or “wand,” could hear the na"
me of the most evil wizard of all 
time without the slightest tremor. 
"“Lord — hang on,” said Uncle Vern"
"on, his face screwed up, a look "
of dawning comprehension in his piggy eyes. “I’ve heard that name 
. . . that was th
e one who . . .” 
"“Murdered my parents,"
" yes,” Harry said. "
"“But he’s gone,” said Uncle Vernon"
" impatiently, without the slight-"
est sign that the murder
 of Harry’s parents might 
be a painful topic to 
anybody. “That giant bloke 
said so. He’s gone.” 
"“He’s back,” said Harry heavily. "
It felt very strange to be standing 
here in Aunt Petunia’s surgically 
"clean kitchen, beside the top-of-the"
-range fridge and the wide-screen 
"television, and talking calmly of "
Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon. 
The arrival of the dementors in Li
ttle Whinging seemed to have 
caused a breach in the gr
"eat, invisible wall that divided the relentlessly "
non-magical world of Privet Driv
e and the world beyond. Harry’s two 
lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned up-
side down: The Dursleys were aski
ng for details about the magical 
world and Mrs. Figg knew Albus Dumbledore; dementors were soar-
ing around Little Whinging and he 
might never go back to Hogwarts. 
Harry’s head throbbed more painfully. 
“Back?” whispered Aunt Petunia. 
 38 She was looking at Harry as she ha
d never looked at him before. 
"And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, Harry fully ap-"
preciated that Aunt Petunia was his 
mother’s sister. He
 could not have 
said why this hit him so very powerf
ully at this moment. All he knew 
was that he was not the only person
 in the room who had an inkling 
of what Lord Voldemort being back might mean. Aunt Petunia had 
never in her life looked at him like th
"at before. Her large, pale eyes (so "
unlike her sister’s) were not narrowed in dislike or anger: They were 
wide and fearful. The furious pret
ense that Aunt Petunia had main-
tained all Harry’s life — 
that there was no magi
c and no world other 
than the world she inhabited with 
Uncle Vernon — seemed to have 
fallen away. 
"“Yes,” Harry said, talk"
ing directly to Aunt 
Petunia now. “He came 
back a month ago. I saw him.” 
Her hands found Dudley’s massive
 leather-clad shoulders and 
clutched them. 
"“Hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and "
"back again, apparently dazed and "
confused by the unprecedented un-
derstanding that seemed to have sprung up between them. “Hang on. 
"This Lord Voldything’s back, you say.” "
“Yes.” 
“The one who murder
ed your parents.” 
“Yes.” 
“And now he’s sending 
dismembers after you?” 
"“Looks like it,” said Harry. "
"“I see,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his white-faced wife to "
Harry and hitching up his trousers. 
"He seemed to be swelling, his "
great purple face 
stretching before Harry’s eyes
". “Well, that settles it,” "
"he said, his shirt front strain"
"ing as he inflated himself, “"
you can get out 
"of this house, boy"
!” 
“What?” said Harry. 
“You heard me — OUT!” Uncle Ve
"rnon bellowed, and even Aunt "
   39 Petunia and Dudley jumped. “OUT! 
OUT! I should’ve done it years 
ago! Owls treating the place like 
"a rest home, puddings exploding, half "
"the lounge destroyed, Dudley’s ta"
"il, Marge bobbing around on the "
"ceiling, and that flyi"
ng Ford Anglia — OUT! OUT! You’ve had it! 
You’re history! You’re not staying here
" if some loony’s after you, you’re "
"not endangering my wife and son, you’re not bringing trouble down "
"on us, if you’re going the same way as"
" your useless parents, I’ve had it! "
OUT!” 
"Harry stood rooted to the spot. The letters from the Ministry, "
"Mr. Weasley, and Sirius were crushed in his left hand. "
Don’t leave the 
"house again, whatever you do. "
DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND 
UNCLE’S HOUSE
. 
“You heard me!” said Uncle Vernon
", bending forward now, so that "
his massive purple face came closer
" to Harry’s, so that Harry actually "
felt flecks of spit hit his face. “Get
 going! You were all keen to leave 
half an hour ago! I’m right behind 
you! Get out and never darken our 
doorstep again! Why we ever kept yo
u in the first place I don’t know. 
"Marge was right, it should have "
"been the orphanage, we were too "
"damn soft for our own good, thought "
"we could squash it out of you, "
"thought we could turn you normal, "
but you’ve been rotten from the 
"beginning, and I’ve had enough — OWLS!” "
The fifth owl zoomed down the chimne
y so fast it actually hit the 
floor before zooming into the air 
again with a loud screech. Harry 
"raised his hand to seize the letter, "
"which was in a scarlet envelope, but "
"it soared straight over his head, flying"
" directly at Aunt Petunia, who let "
"out a scream and ducked, her arms over her face. The owl dropped the "
"red envelope on her head, turned, an"
d flew straight up the chimney 
again. 
"Harry darted forward to pick up the letter, but Aunt Petunia beat "
him to it. 
"“You can open it if you like,” said "
"Harry, “but I’ll hear what it says "
anyway. That’s a Howler.” 
 40 "“Let go of it, Petunia!” roared "
"Uncle Vernon. “Don’t touch it, it "
could be dangerous!” 
"“It’s addressed to me,” said Aunt "
Petunia in a shaking voice. “It’s 
addressed to 
me
", Vernon, look! "
"Mrs. Petunia Dursley, The Kitchen, "
"Number Four, Privet Drive"
 —” 
"She caught her breath, horrified"
. The red envelope had begun to 
smoke. 
“Open it!” Harry urged her. “Get it over with! It’ll happen 
anyway —” 
“No —” 
Aunt Petunia’s hand was trembling. She looked wildly around the 
kitchen as though looking for an es
"cape route, but too late — the en-"
velope burst into flames. Aunt 
Petunia screamed 
and dropped it. 
"An awful voice filled the kitchen, "
"echoing in the confined space, is-"
suing from the burning 
letter on the table. 
“
"REMEMBER MY LAST, PETUNIA"
.” 
Aunt Petunia looked as though she might faint. She sank into the 
"chair beside Dudley, her face in her hands. The remains of the enve-"
lope smoldered into ash in the silence. 
“What is this?” Uncle Vernon sa
id hoarsely. “What — I don’t — 
Petunia?” 
Aunt Petunia said nothing. Dudl
ey was staring stupidly at his 
"mother, his mouth hanging open. Th"
e silence spiraled horribly. Harry 
"was watching his aunt, utterly bewi"
"ldered, his head throbbing fit to "
burst. 
"“Petunia, dear?” said Uncle Vernon timidly. “P-Petunia?” "
She raised her head. She was st
ill trembling. She swallowed. 
"“The boy — the boy will have to stay, Vernon,” she said weakly. "
“W-what?” 
   41 "“He stays,” she said. She was not "
looking at Harry. She got to her 
feet again. 
“He . . . but Petunia . . .” 
"“If we throw him out, the neighbors "
"will talk,” she said. She was re-"
"gaining her usual brisk, snappish ma"
"nner rapidly, though she was still "
"very pale. “They’ll ask awkward questions, they’ll want to know where "
he’s gone. We’ll have to keep him.” 
Uncle Vernon was deflat
ing like an old tire. 
"“But Petunia, dear —” "
Aunt Petunia ignored him. She turned to Harry. 
"“You’re to stay in your room,” "
she said. “You’re not to leave the 
house. Now get to bed.” 
Harry didn’t move. 
“Who was that Howler from?” 
"“Don’t ask questions,” "
Aunt Petunia snapped. 
“Are you in touch with wizards?” 
“I told you to get to bed!” 
“What did it mean? Reme
mber the last what?” 
“Go to bed!” 
“How come — ?” 
“YOU HEARD YOUR AUNT
", NOW GET TO BED!” "
’
ve just been attacked by dementors and I might be expelled from 
Hogwarts. I want to know what’s go
ing on and when I’m going to get 
out of here.
Harry copied these words onto thr
ee separate pieces of parchment 
the moment he reached the desk in
 his dark bedroom. He addressed 
"the first to Sirius, the second to "
"Ron, and the third to Hermione. His "
"owl, Hedwig, was off hunting; he"
r cage stood empty on the desk. 
Harry paced the bedroom waiting fo
"r her to come back, his head "
"pounding, his brain too busy for sl"
eep even though his eyes stung and 
itched with tiredness. His back 
"ached from carrying Dudley home, "
and the two lumps on his head wher
e the window and Dudley had hit 
him were throbbing painfully. 
"Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration, "
grinding his teeth and clenching his 
"fists, casting an"
gry looks out at 
"the empty, star-strewn sky every "
time he passed the window. Demen-
"tors sent to get him, Mrs. Figg "
and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him 
"in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Min-"
istry of Magic — and 
still
 no one was telling him what was going on. 
I 
   43 "And what, "
"what,"
 had that Howler been 
about? Whose voice had 
"echoed so horribly, so mena"
"cingly, through the kitchen? "
Why was he still trapped here 
without information? Why was 
everyone treating him li
ke some naughty kid? 
Don’t do any more 
"magic, stay in the house."
 . . . 
"He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far from relieving his "
"anger he felt worse, as he now had a "
sharp pain in his toe to deal with 
in addition to the pain in the rest of his body. 
Just as he limped past the window
", Hedwig soared through it with "
a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost. 
"“About time!” Harry snarled, as sh"
e landed lightly on top of her 
"cage. “You can put that down,"
 I’ve got work for you!” 
Hedwig’s large round amber eyes 
gazed reproachfully at him over 
the dead frog clamped in her beak. 
"“Come here,” said Harry, picking "
up the three small rolls of parch-
ment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg. “Take 
"these straight to Sirius, Ron, and Hermione and don’t come back here "
without good long replies. Keep pe
cking them till they’ve written 
decent-length answers if yo
u’ve got to. 
Understand?” 
Hedwig gave a muffled hooting no
"ise, beak still full of frog. "
"“Get going, then,” said Harry. "
She took off immediately. The 
"moment she’d gone, Harry threw "
himself down onto his bed without un
dressing and stared at the dark 
ceiling. In addition to every other 
"miserable feeling, he now felt guilty "
that he’d been irritable with Hedwig; 
she was the only friend he had at 
"number four, Privet Drive. But he’d make it up to her when she came "
"back with Sirius’s, Ron’s, and Hermione’s answers. "
They were bound to write back qu
ickly; they couldn’t possibly ig-
nore a dementor attack. He’d probably wake up tomorrow to three fat 
letters full of sympathy and plans 
for his immediate removal to the 
Burrow. And with that comforting idea
", sleep rolled over him, stifling "
all further thought. 
 44 ' '
But Hedwig didn’t return next morning. Harry spent the day in his 
"bedroom, leaving it only to go to "
the bathroom. Three times that day 
Aunt Petunia shoved food into his 
room through the cat flap Uncle 
Vernon had installed three summers 
ago. Every time Harry heard her 
approaching he tried to question 
"her about the Howler, but he might "
as well have interrogated the doorkn
ob for all the answers he got. 
Otherwise the Dursleys kept well 
clear of his bedroom. Harry couldn’t 
see the point of forcing his comp
any on them; another row would 
achieve nothing except perhaps ma
king him so angry he’d perform 
more illegal magic. 
So it went on for three whole days
. Harry was filled alternately with 
"restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during "
"which he paced his bedroom again, "
furious at the whole lot of them 
"for leaving him to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete "
that he could lie on his bed for an 
"hour at a time, staring dazedly into "
"space, aching with dread at the th"
ought of the Ministry hearing. 
What if they ruled against him? What if he 
was
 expelled and his 
wand was snapped in half? What 
"would he do, where would he go? "
"He could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now "
"that he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged. "
. . . Was it possible that 
he might be able to move
" into Sirius’s house, "
"as Sirius had suggested a year ago, "
before he had been forced to flee 
from the Ministry himself? Would he
" be allowed to live there alone, "
given that he was still underage? 
Or would the matter of where he 
went next be decided for him; had 
his breach of the International 
Statute of Secrecy been severe enough
 to land him in a cell in Azka-
ban? Whenever this thought occurre
"d, Harry invariably slid off his "
bed and began pacing again. 
On the fourth night after Hedwig
’s departure Harry was lying in 
"one of his apathetic phases, staring "
"at the ceiling, his exhausted mind "
   45 "quite blank, when his uncle en"
tered his bedroom. Harry looked 
slowly around at him. 
Uncle Vernon was wearing 
his best suit and an 
expression of enormous smugness. 
"“We’re going out,” he said. "
“Sorry?” 
"“We — that is to say, your aunt"
", Dudley, and I — "
are going out.” 
"“Fine,” said Harry dully, look"
ing back at the ceiling. 
“You are not to leave your 
bedroom while we are away.” 
“Okay.” 
"“You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our "
possessions.” 
“Right.” 
“You are not to steal food from the fridge.” 
“Okay.” 
“I am going to 
lock your door.” 
“You do that.” 
"Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearl"
y suspicious of this lack of ar-
"gument, then stomped out of the "
room and closed the door behind 
him. Harry heard the key turn in th
e lock and Uncle Vernon’s foot-
steps walking heavily down the stairs
. A few minutes later he heard the 
"slamming of car doors, the rumble of"
" an engine, and the unmistakable "
sound of the car sweepi
ng out of the drive. 
Harry had no particular feeling about 
the Dursleys leaving. It made 
no difference to him whether they were
 in the house or not. He could 
not even summon the energy to get up
 and turn on his bedroom light. 
The room grew steadily darker arou
nd him as he lay listening to the 
"night sounds through the window he kept open all the time, waiting "
for the blessed moment 
when Hedwig returned. 
The empty house creaked around him. The pipes gurgled. Harry 
"lay there in a kind of stupor, t"
"hinking of nothing, suspended in "
misery. 
"And then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below. "
 46 "He sat bolt upright, listening in"
tently. The Dursleys couldn’t be 
"back, it was much too s"
"oon, and in any case he "
hadn’t heard their car. 
There was silence for 
"a few seconds, and then he heard voices. "
"Burglars,"
" he thought, sliding off the "
bed onto his feet — but a split 
second later it occurred to him that
 burglars would keep their voices 
"down, and whoever was moving arou"
nd in the kitchen was certainly 
not troubling to do so. 
He snatched up his wand from his bedside table and stood facing 
"his bedroom door, listening with a"
ll his might. Next moment he 
jumped as the lock gave a loud
 click and his d
oor swung open. 
"Harry stood motionless, staring through the open door at the dark "
"upstairs landing, straining his ears"
" for further sounds, but none came. "
He hesitated for a moment and then 
moved swiftly and silently out of 
his room to the head of the stairs. 
His heart shot upward into his throat. There were people standing 
"in the shadowy hall below, silhoue"
tted against the streetlight glowing 
through the glass door; eight or nine of
" them, all, as far as he could "
"see, looking up at him. "
"“Lower your wand, boy, before yo"
"u take someone’s eye out,” said a "
"low, growling voice. "
Harry’s heart was thumping uncontro
"llably. He knew that voice, "
but he did not lower his wand. 
“Professor Moody?” he 
said uncertainly. 
"“I don’t know so much about ‘Professor,’” growled the voice, “never "
"got round to much teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you "
properly.” 
"Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it, nor "
did he move. He had very good reason to be suspicious. He had re-
cently spent nine mont
hs in what he had thought was Mad-Eye 
Moody’s company only to find out that
" it wasn’t Moody at all, but an "
"impostor; an impostor, moreover, who had tried to kill Harry before  "
   47 being unmasked. But befo
re he could make a de
cision about what to 
"do next, a second, slightly ho"
arse voice floated upstairs. 
"“It’s all right, Harry. We’v"
e come to take
 you away.” 
Harry’s heart leapt. He knew that
" voice too, though he hadn’t "
heard it for more than a year. 
“P-Professor Lupin?” he said disbelievingly. “Is that you?” 
"“Why are we all standing in the dark?” said a third voice, this one "
"completely unfamiliar, a woman’s. “"
Lumos.
” 
"A wand tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light. Harry "
blinked. The people below were crow
"ded around the foot of the stairs, "
"gazing intently up at him, some cr"
aning their heads for a better look. 
Remus Lupin stood nearest to him
". Though still quite young, "
Lupin looked tired and rather ill; he had more gray hair than when 
"Harry had said good-bye to him, an"
d his robes were
 more patched 
and shabbier than ever. Nevertheless
", he was smiling broadly at Harry, "
who tried to smile back
 through his shock. 
"“Oooh, he looks just like I though"
"t he would,” said the witch who "
was holding her lit wand aloft. She 
looked the youngest there; she had 
"a pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkl"
"ing eyes, and short spiky hair that "
"was a violent shade of violet. “Wotcher, Harry!” "
"“Yeah, I see what you mean, Remu"
"s,” said a bald"
 black wizard 
standing farthest back; he had a d
"eep, slow voice and wore a single "
gold hoop in his ear. “He looks exactly like James.” 
"“Except the eyes,” said a wheezy-vo"
"iced, silver-haired wizard at the "
back. “Lily’s eyes.” 
"Mad-Eye Moody, who had long griz"
zled gray hair and a large 
"chunk missing from his nose, was "
squinting suspiciously at Harry 
"through his mismatched eyes. One of the eyes was small, dark, and "
"beady, the other large, round, and el"
ectric blue — the 
magical eye that 
"could see through walls, doors, and the back of Moody’s own head. "
"“Are you quite sure it’s him, Lupin?” he growled. “It’d be a nice  "
 48 lookout if we bring back some De
ath Eater impersonating him. We 
ought to ask him something only th
e real Potter would know. Unless 
anyone brought any Veritaserum?” 
"“Harry, what form does your Pa"
tronus take?” said Lupin. 
"“A stag,” said Harry nervously. "
"“That’s him, Mad-Ey"
"e,” said Lupin. "
"Harry descended the stairs, very cons"
cious of everybody still staring 
"at him, stowing his wand into the ba"
ck pocket of his jeans as he came. 
"“Don’t put your wand there, boy!” roared Moody. “What if it ig-"
nited? Better wizards than you ha
"ve lost buttocks, you know!” "
“Who d’you know who’s lost a bu
ttock?” the violet-haired woman 
asked Mad-Eye interestedly. 
"“Never you mind, you just keep your wand out of your back "
pocket!” growled Mad-Eye. “Element
"ary wand safety, nobody bothers "
about it anymore. . . .” He stumped 
off toward the kitchen. “And I saw 
"that,” he added irritably, as the wo"
man rolled her eyes at the ceiling. 
Lupin held out his hand
 and shook Harry’s. 
"“How are you?” he asked, "
looking at Harry closely. 
“F-fine . . .” 
Harry could hardly believ
e this was real. Four 
"weeks with nothing, "
not the tiniest hint of a plan to re
"move him from Privet Drive, and "
suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matter-of-factly in 
the house as though this were a long-standing arrangement. He 
glanced at the people surrounding Lupi
n; they were still gazing avidly 
at him. He felt very conscious of th
e fact that he had not combed his 
hair for four days. 
“I’m — you’re really lucky the Durs
leys are out . . .” he mumbled. 
"“Lucky, ha!” said the violet-haire"
d woman. “It was me that lured 
them out of the way. Sent a letter by Muggle post telling them they’d 
been short-listed for the All-En
gland Best-Kept Suburban Lawn 
Competition. They’re heading off to 
the prize-giving right now. . . . 
Or they think they are.” 
   49 Harry had a fleeting visi
on of Uncle Vernon’s face when he realized 
there was no All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn Competition. 
"“We are leaving, aren’t we?” he asked. “Soon?” "
"“Almost at once,” said Lupin, “we’"
re just waiting for the all-clear.” 
“Where are we going? The Bu
rrow?” Harry asked hopefully. 
"“Not the Burrow, no,” said Lu"
"pin, motioning Harry toward the "
kitchen; the little knot of wizards 
"followed, all still eyeing Harry curi-"
ously. “Too risky. We’ve set up he
adquarters somewhere undetectable. 
It’s taken a while. . . .” 
Mad-Eye Moody was now sitting at
 the kitchen table swigging 
"from a hip flask, his magical eye spi"
nning in all direct
"ions, taking in "
the Dursleys’ many labor-saving appliances. 
"“This is Alastor Moody, Harry,” Lupi"
"n continued, pointing toward "
Moody. 
"“Yeah, I know,” said Harry uncomfor"
tably; it felt odd to be intro-
duced to somebody he’d thou
ght he’d known for a year. 
“And this is 
Nymphadora —” 
“
Don’t
" call me Nymphadora, Remus,” said the young witch with a "
shudder. “It’s Tonks.” 
"“— Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers"
 to be known by her surname 
"only,” finished Lupin. "
“So would you if your fool of 
a mother had called you ‘Nympha-
"dora,’” muttered Tonks. "
“And this is Kingsley Shacklebol
t” — he indicated the tall black 
"wizard, who bowed — “Elphias Do"
ge” — the wheezy-voiced wizard 
nodded — “Dedalus Diggle —” 
"“We’ve met before,” squeaked th"
"e excitable Diggle, dropping his "
top hat. 
“— Emmeline Vance” — a stately 
looking witch in an emerald-
green shawl inclined her head — “Stu
rgis Podmore” — a square-jawed 
"wizard with thick, stra"
w-colored hair winked — “and Hestia Jones.” A 
"pink-cheeked, black-haired witch waved from next to the toaster. "
 50 Harry inclined his head awkwardly at 
each of them as they were in-
troduced. He wished they would look
 at something other than him; it 
was as though he had suddenly be
en ushered onstage. He also won-
dered why so many of
 them were there. 
"“A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,” "
"said Lupin, as though he had re"
ad Harry’s mind; the corners of his 
mouth twitched slightly. 
"“Yeah, well, the more the better,” "
said Moody darkly. “We’re your 
"guard, Potter.” "
“We’re just waiting for the signal to
" tell us it’s safe to set off,” said "
"Lupin, glancing out of the kitch"
en window. “We’ve got about fifteen 
minutes.” 
“Very 
"clean,"
" aren’t they, these Muggles?”"
 said the witch called 
"Tonks, who was looking around the "
kitchen with great interest. “My 
dad’s Muggle-born and he’s a right ol
"d slob. I suppose it varies, just "
like with wizards?” 
"“Er — yeah,” said Harry. “Look” "
— he turned back to Lupin — 
"“what’s going on, I haven’t heard anyt"
"hing from anyone, what’s Vol — ?” "
Several of the witches and wiza
rds made odd hissing noises; 
"Dedalus Diggle dropped his hat again, and Moody growled, “"
Shut up
!” 
“What?” said Harry. 
“We’re not discussing anything he
"re, it’s too risky,” said Moody, "
turning his normal eye on Harry; his
 magical eye remained pointing 
up at the ceiling. “
"Damn it,"
"” he added angrily, pu"
tting a hand up to 
"the magical eye, “it keeps sticking — "
ever since that scum wore it —” 
And with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being 
"pulled from a sink, he popped out his eye. "
"“Mad-Eye, you do know that’s disgusting, don’t you?” said Tonks "
conversationally. 
"“Get me a glass of water, wo"
"uld you, Harry?” asked Moody. "
"Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took "
"out a clean glass, and filled it  "
   51 "with water at the sink, still watche"
d eagerly by the band of wizards. 
Their relentless staring was 
starting to annoy him. 
"“Cheers,” said Moody, when Harry "
handed him the glass. He 
dropped the magical eyeball into 
the water and prodded it up and 
"down; the eye whizzed around, starin"
g at them all in turn. “I want 
three-hundred-and-sixty degrees visi
bility on the return journey.” 
“How’re we getting — wherever
 we’re going?” Harry asked. 
"“Brooms,” said Lupin. “Only way."
" You’re too young to Apparate, "
"they’ll be watching the Floo Network,"
 and it’s more than our life’s 
worth to set up an un
authorized Portkey.” 
"“Remus says you’re a good flier,” "
said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his 
deep voice. 
"“He’s excellent,” said Lupin, wh"
o was checking his watch. “Any-
"way, you’d better go and get packed, "
"Harry, we want to be ready to go "
when the signal comes.” 
"“I’ll come and help you,” said Tonks brightly. "
"She followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking "
around with much cu
riosity and interest. 
"“Funny place,” she said, “it’s a bit "
too
" clean, d’you know what I "
"mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is be"
"tter,” she added, as they entered "
Harry’s bedroom and he 
turned on the light. 
His room was certainly much messier
 than the rest of the house. 
Confined to it for four days in 
"a very bad mood, Harry had not both-"
ered tidying up after himself. Most 
of the books he ow
ned were strewn 
over the floor where he’d tried to distract himself with each in turn and 
thrown it aside. Hedwig’s cage neede
d cleaning out and was starting to 
"smell, and his trunk lay open, reve"
aling a jumbled mixture of Muggle 
clothes and wizard’s robes that had spilled onto the floor around it. 
Harry started picking up books and 
throwing them hastily into his 
trunk. Tonks paused at his open ward
robe to look critically at her re-
flection in the mi
rror on the inside of the door. 
 52 "“You know, I don’t think purple’s "
"really my color,” she said pen-"
"sively, tugging at a lock"
 of spiky hair. “D’you 
think it makes me look 
a bit peaky?” 
"“Er —” said Harry, looking up"
 at her over the top of 
Quidditch 
Teams of Britain and Ireland
. 
"“Yeah, it does,” said Tonks decisively. She screwed up her eyes in a "
strained expression as though she 
were struggling to remember some-
"thing. A second later, her ha"
ir had turned bubble-gum pink. 
"“How did you do that?” said Harry,"
 gaping at her as she opened her 
eyes again. 
"“I’m a Metamorphmagus,” she said, "
looking back at her reflection 
and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions. 
"“It means I can change my appearance at will,” she added, spotting "
Harry’s puzzled expression in the mi
rror behind her. “I was born one. 
I got top marks in Concealment and 
Disguise during Auror training 
without any study at 
"all, it was great.” "
"“You’re an Auror?” said Harry, im"
pressed. Being a Dark wizard 
catcher was the only career he’d 
ever considered after Hogwarts. 
"“Yeah,” said Tonks, looking proud. “Kingsley is as well; he’s a bit "
"higher up than I am, though. I only qualified a year ago. Nearly failed "
"on Stealth and Tracking, I’m dead clumsy, did you hear me break that "
plate when we arrived downstairs?” 
“Can you learn how to be a Me
"tamorphmagus?” Harry asked her, "
"straightening up, completely "
forgetting about packing. 
Tonks chuckled. 
“Bet you wouldn’t mind hiding 
"that scar sometimes, eh?” "
Her eyes found the lightning-shap
ed scar on Ha
rry’s forehead. 
"“No, I wouldn’t mind,” Harry mumb"
"led, turning away. He did not "
like people star
ing at his scar. 
"“Well, you’ll have to learn the hard"
" way, I’m afraid,” said Tonks. "
"“Metamorphmagi are really rare, "
"they’re born, not made. Most wiz-"
ards need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance. . . . 
   53 "But we’ve got to get going, Harry, "
"we’re supposed to be packing,” she "
"added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor. "
"“Oh — yeah,” said Harry, gra"
bbing up a few more books. 
"“Don’t be stupid, it’ll be much quicker if I — "
pack
"!” cried Tonks, "
"waving her wand in a long, swee"
ping movement over the floor. 
"Books, clothes, telescope, and scales"
 all soared into the air and flew 
pell-mell into the trunk. 
"“It’s not very neat,” said Tonks, wa"
lking over to the trunk and look-
ing down at the jumble inside. “My 
mum’s got this knack of getting 
stuff to fit itself in 
neatly — she even gets the socks to fold them-
selves — but I’ve never mastered ho
w she does it — it’s a kind of 
flick —” 
She flicked her wand hopefully; on
e of Harry’s socks gave a feeble 
sort of wiggle and fl
opped back on top of the mess within. 
"“Ah, well,” said Tonks, slamming the "
"trunk’s lid shut, “at least it’s all "
in. That could do with a 
"bit of cleaning, too — "
Scourgify
 —” She 
pointed her wand at Hedwig’s cage; a few feathers and droppings van-
"ished. “Well, that’s a "
bit
 better — I’ve never 
quite got the hang of 
these sort of householdy spells. 
Right — got everything? Cauldron? 
Broom? Wow! A 
Firebolt
?” 
Her eyes widened as they fell on
 the broomstick in Harry’s right 
"hand. It was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international stan-"
dard broomstick. 
"“And I’m still riding a Comet Two Sixty,” said Tonks enviously. “Ah "
well . . . wand still in your jeans? 
"Both buttocks still on? Okay, let’s go. "
Locomotor Trunk.
” 
Harry’s trunk rose a few inches into 
the air. Holding her wand like a 
"conductor’s baton, Tonks made it ho"
ver across the room and out of the 
"door ahead of them, Hedwig’s cage in her left hand. Harry followed her "
down the stairs carrying his broomstick. 
"Back in the kitchen, Moody ha"
"d replaced his eye, which was "
spinning so fast after its cleaning
 it made Harry feel sick. Kingsley 
 54 Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore we
re examining the microwave and 
Hestia Jones was laughing at a pota
to peeler she had come across while 
rummaging in the drawers. Lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the 
Dursleys. 
"“Excellent,” said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered. "
"“We’ve got about a minute, I think. "
We should probably get out into 
"the garden so we’re ready. Harry, I’ve "
left a letter telling your aunt and 
uncle not to worry —” 
"“They won’t,” "
said Harry. 
“That you’re safe —” 
“That’ll just depress them.” 
“— and you’ll see them next summer.” 
“Do I have to?” 
Lupin smiled but made no answer. 
"“Come here, boy,” said Moody gr"
"uffly, beckoning Harry toward "
him with his wand. “I need to Disillusion you.” 
“You need to what?” 
said Harry nervously. 
"“Disillusionment Charm,” said Moody, raising his wand. “Lupin "
says you’ve got an Invisibility Cloa
"k, but it won’t stay on while we’re "
flying; this’ll disguise yo
u better. Here you go —” 
He rapped Harry hard on the top 
of the head and Harry felt a cu-
rious sensation as though Moody had 
just smashed an egg there; cold 
trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand 
had struck. 
"“Nice one, Mad-Eye,” said Tonks "
"appreciatively, staring at Harry’s "
midriff. 
"Harry looked down at his body, or "
"rather, what had been his body, "
for it didn’t look anything like his 
anymore. It was not invisible; it had 
simply taken on the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind 
him. He seemed to have 
become a human chameleon. 
"“Come on,” said Moody, unlockin"
g the back door with his wand. 
They all stepped outside onto Uncl
e Vernon’s beautifully kept lawn. 
   55 "“Clear night,” grunted Moody, his "
magical eye scanning the heav-
ens. “Could’ve done with a bit more
" cloud cover. Right, you,” he "
"barked at Harry, “we’re going to be "
flying in close formation. Tonks’ll 
be right in front of yo
"u, keep close on her tail. Lupin’ll be covering "
you from below. I’m going to be behin
d you. The rest’ll 
be circling us. 
"We don’t break ranks for anything, go"
t me? If one of us is killed —” 
“Is that likely?” Harry asked a
"pprehensively, but Moody ignored "
him. 
"“— the others keep flying, don’t "
"stop, don’t break "
ranks. If they 
"take out all of us and you survive, "
"Harry, the rear guard are standing "
by to take over; keep flying
 east and they’ll join you.” 
"“Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, "
he’ll think we’re not taking this 
"seriously,” said Tonks, as she st"
rapped Harry’s trunk and Hedwig’s 
cage into a harness ha
nging from her broom. 
“I’m just telling the 
"boy the plan,” growled "
Moody. “Our job’s to 
deliver him safely to headquarters 
and if we die in the attempt —” 
"“No one’s going to die,” said Ki"
"ngsley Shacklebolt in his deep, "
calming voice. 
"“Mount your brooms, that’s the first signal!” said Lupin sharply, "
pointing into the sky. 
"Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had flared among "
the stars. Harry recognized them at once as wand sparks. He swung 
"his right leg over his Firebolt, gri"
"pped its handle tightly, and felt it "
"vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in "
the air once more. 
"“Second signal, let’s go!” said Lu"
"pin loudly, as more sparks, green "
"this time, exploded"
 high above them. 
Harry kicked off hard from the gr
ound. The cool night air rushed 
through his hair as the neat square 
"gardens of Privet Drive fell away, "
shrinking rapidly into a patchwor
"k of dark greens and blacks, and "
every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as 
though the rush of air had blown it 
out of his head. He felt as though 
 56 his heart was going to explode with 
"pleasure; he was flying again, fly-"
"ing away from Privet Drive as he’d been fantasizing about all summer, "
he was going home. . . . For a few gl
"orious moments, all his problems "
"seemed to recede into nothing, insi"
"gnificant in the vast, starry sky. "
"“Hard left, hard left, there’s a Mu"
ggle looking up!” shouted Moody 
from behind him. Tonks swerved an
"d Harry followed her, watching "
his trunk swinging wildly beneath 
her broom. “We need more height. 
. . . Give it another 
quarter of a mile!” 
Harry’s eyes watered in the chill as 
they soared upward; he could see 
nothing below now but tiny pinpricks 
of light that were car headlights 
and streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Ver-
non’s car. . . . The Dursleys woul
d be heading back to their empty 
"house right now, full of rage abou"
t the nonexistent lawn competition 
. . . and Harry laughed aloud at th
"e thought, though his voice was "
drowned by the flapping of the othe
"rs’ robes, the creaking of the har-"
"ness holding his trunk and the cage, the "
whoosh
 of the wind in their 
ears as they sped through the air. He
" had not felt this alive in a month, "
or this happy. . . . 
“Bearing south!” shouted 
Mad-Eye. “Town ahead!” 
"They soared right, so that they did not pass directly over the glit-"
tering spiderweb of lights below. 
"“Bear southeast and keep climbing, there’s some low cloud ahead "
we can lose ourselve
s in!” called Moody. 
“We’re not going through clouds!”
 shouted Tonks angrily. “We’ll 
"get soaked, Mad-Eye!” "
Harry was relieved to hear her sa
y this; his hands were growing 
numb on the Firebolt’s handle. He 
wished he had thought to put on a 
coat; he was starting to shiver. 
They altered their course every 
now and then according to Mad-
Eye’s instructions. Harry’s eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy 
wind that was starting to make his ears ache. He could remember be-
ing this cold on a broom only on
"ce before, during the Quidditch "
   57 match against Hufflepuff in his thir
"d year, which had taken place in a "
storm. The guard around him was ci
rcling continuously like giant 
birds of prey. Harry lost track of time. He wondered how long they 
had been flying; it felt 
like an hour at least. 
“Turning southwest!” yelled 
Moody. “We want to avoid the 
motorway!” 
Harry was now so chilled that he 
thought longingly for a moment 
"of the snug, dry interiors of the cars"
" streaming along below, then, even "
"more longingly, of traveling by "
Floo powder; it might be uncomfort-
able to spin around in fireplaces bu
t it was at least warm in the flames. 
. . . Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped ar
"ound him, bald pate and earring "
gleaming slightly in the moonlight. . . . Now Emmeline Vance was on 
"his right, her wand out, her head turning left and right . . . then she "
"too swooped over him, "
to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore. . . . 
"“We ought to double back for a bit, "
just to make sure we’re not be-
ing followed!” Moody shouted. 
"“ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE?” Tonks "
screamed from the front. 
“We’re all frozen to our brooms! If we keep going off course we’re not 
going to get there until next 
week! We’re nearly there now!” 
“Time to start the descent!” came
" Lupin’s voice. “Follow Tonks, "
Harry!” 
Harry followed Tonks into a dive. Th
ey were heading for the largest 
collection of lights he had yet seen
", a huge, sprawling, crisscrossing "
"mass, glittering in line"
"s and grids, interspersed with patches of deep-"
est black. Lower and lower they fl
"ew, until Harry could see individual "
"headlights and streetlamps, chimney"
"s, and television aerials. He "
wanted to reach the ground very much
", though he felt sure that some-"
one would have to unfreeze him from his broom. 
"“Here we go!” called Tonks, and a few seconds later she had landed. "
Harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch 
of unkempt grass in the middle of 
a small square. Tonks was already 
"unbuckling Harry’s trunk. Shivering, Harry looked around. The grimy "
 58 fronts of the surrounding houses we
re not welcoming; some of them 
"had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the street-"
"lamps, paint was peeling from many "
"of the doors, and heaps of rubbish "
lay outside several se
ts of front steps. 
"“Where are we?” Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, “In a minute.” "
"Moody was rummaging in his cloak,"
 his gnarled hands clumsy with 
cold. 
"“Got it,” he muttered, raising what"
 looked like a silver cigarette 
lighter into the air and clicking it. 
The nearest streetlamp went out 
with a pop. He clicked the un-
lighter again; the next lamp went out. He kept clicking until every 
lamp in the square was extinguished and the only light in the square 
came from curtained windows an
d the sickle moon overhead. 
"“Borrowed it from Dumbledore,"
"” growled Moody, pocketing the "
Put-Outer. “That’ll take care of any Muggles looking out of the win-
"dow, see? Now, come on, quick.” "
He took Harry by the 
"arm and led him from the patch of grass, "
"across the road, and onto the pave"
"ment. Lupin and Tonks followed, "
"carrying Harry’s trunk between them, th"
"e rest of the guard, all with "
"their wands out, flanking them. "
The muffled pounding of a stereo
 was coming from an upper win-
dow in the nearest house. A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came 
from the pile of bulg
ing bin-bags just insi
de the broken gate. 
"“Here,” Moody muttered, thrustin"
g a piece of parchment toward 
Harry’s Disillusioned hand and holding 
"his lit wand close to it, so as "
to illuminate the writing. 
“Read quickly an
d memorize.” 
Harry looked down at the piece of
 paper. The narrow handwriting 
was vaguely familiar. It said: 
The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at 
"number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London. "
hat’s the Order of th
e — ?” Harry began. 
"“Not here, boy!” snarled Moody"
. “Wait till we’re inside!” 
He pulled the piece of parchment 
out of Harry’s hand and set fire 
to it with his wand tip. As the me
ssage curled into flames and floated 
"to the ground, Harry looked around "
at the houses again. They were 
standing outside number eleven; he
 looked to the left and saw num-
"ber ten; to the right, however, was number thirteen. "
“But where’s — ?” 
“Think about what you’ve just 
"memorized,” said Lupin quietly. "
"Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about num-"
"ber twelve, Grimmauld Place, than"
 a battered door emerged out of 
nowhere between numbers eleven an
"d thirteen, followed swiftly by "
dirty walls and grimy windows. It 
was as though an extra house had 
"inflated, pushing those on either side"
 out of its way. Harry gaped at it. 
The stereo in number eleven thu
dded on. Apparently the Muggles in-
side hadn’t even felt anything. 
"“Come on, hurry,” growled Moody,"
 prodding Harry in the back. 
W 
 60 Harry walked up the worn stone step
"s, staring at the newly materi-"
alized door. Its black paint was sha
bby and scratched. The silver door 
knocker was in the form of a twiste
d serpent. There was no keyhole or 
letterbox. 
Lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once. Harry heard 
"many loud, metallic clicks and wh"
at sounded like the clatter of a 
chain. The door creaked open. 
"“Get in quick, Harry,” Lupin whispe"
red. “But don’t go far inside 
and don’t touch anything.” 
Harry stepped over the threshold in
to the almost total darkness of 
"the hall. He could smell damp, dust, "
"and a sweetish, rotting smell; the "
place had the feeling of a derelict bu
ilding. He looked over his shoul-
der and saw the others filing in be
"hind him, Lupin and Tonks carrying "
his trunk and Hedwig’s cage. Moody 
was standing on 
the top step and 
releasing the balls of light the Put-
Outer had stolen 
from the street-
lamps; they flew back 
to their bulbs and the 
square beyond glowed 
momentarily with orange light before Moody limped inside and 
"closed the front door, so that the darkness in the hall became complete. "
“Here —” 
He rapped Harry hard over the he
ad with his wand; Harry felt as 
though something hot was tricklin
g down his back this time and 
knew that the Disillusionment
 Charm must have lifted. 
"“Now stay still, everyone, while I "
"give us a bit of light in here,” "
Moody whispered. 
The others’ hushed voices were 
giving Harry an odd feeling of fore-
boding; it was as though
 they had just entered the house of a dying 
person. He heard a soft hissing 
noise and then old-fashioned gas 
lamps sputtered into life all along th
"e walls, casting a flickering insub-"
stantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a 
"long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered over-"
head and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls. Harry  
"NUMBER  TWELVE, "
   61 heard something scuttling behind the baseboard. Both the chandelier 
and the candelabra on a 
rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents. 
"There were hurried footsteps and Ron’s mother, Mrs. Weasley, "
emerged from a door at 
the far end of the hall
. She was beaming in 
welcome as she hurried toward th
"em, though Harry noticed that she "
was rather thinner and paler than sh
e had been last time he had seen 
her. 
"“Oh, Harry, it’s lovely to see you!” she whispered, pulling him into "
a rib-cracking hug before holding 
him at arm’s length and examining 
him critically. “You’re looking peak
"y; you need feeding up, but you’ll "
have to wait a bit for di
"nner, I’m afraid. . . .” "
She turned to the gang of wiza
rds behind him and whispered ur-
"gently, “He’s just ar"
"rived, the meeting’s started. . . .” "
The wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest and excite-
ment and began filing
 past Harry toward the door through which 
"Mrs. Weasley had just come; Harry made to follow Lupin, but Mrs. "
Weasley held him back. 
"“No, Harry, the meeting’s only for members of the Order. Ron and "
"Hermione are upstairs, you can wait"
 with them until the meeting’s 
over and then we’ll have
 dinner. And keep your voice down in the 
"hall,” she added in "
an urgent whisper. 
“Why?” 
“I don’t want to wake anything up.” 
“What d’you — ?” 
"“I’ll explain later, I’ve got to hu"
"rry, I’m supposed to be at the meet-"
ing — I’ll just show you 
where you’re sleeping.” 
"Pressing her finger to her lips, she "
led him on tiptoes past a pair of 
"long, moth-eaten curtains, behind "
which Harry supposed there must 
"be another door, and after skirting a "
large umbrella stand that looked 
as though it had been made from a se
"vered troll’s leg, they started up "
"the dark staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on  "
 62 plaques on the wall. A closer look showed Harry that the heads be-
longed to house-elves. All of them 
had the same rather snoutlike nose. 
Harry’s bewilderment deepened with 
every step he took. What on 
earth were they doing in a house that
 looked as though it belonged to 
the Darkest of wizards? 
"“Mrs. Weasley, why — ?” "
“Ron and Hermione will explain eve
"rything, dear, I’ve really got to "
"dash,” Mrs. Weasley whispered di"
stractedly. “There” — they had 
reached the second landing — “you’re the door on the right. I’ll call 
you when it’s over.” 
And she hurried off 
downstairs again. 
"Harry crossed the dingy landing,"
" turned the bedroom doorknob, "
which was shaped like a serpen
"t’s head, and opened the door. "
"He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded "
"room, then there was a loud twitteri"
"ng noise, followed by an even "
"louder shriek, and his vision was completely obscured by a large quan-"
tity of very bushy hair — Hermione 
had thrown herself onto him in a 
"hug that nearly knocked him flat, while Ron’s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, "
zoomed excitedly round 
and round their heads. 
"“HARRY! Ron, he’s here, Harry’s he"
re! We didn’t hear you arrive! 
"Oh, how "
are
 you? Are you all right? Have you been furious with us? I 
"bet you have, I know our letters were"
 useless — but we couldn’t tell 
"you anything, Dumbledore made us swear we wouldn’t, oh, we’ve got "
"so much to tell you, and you’ve go"
t to tell us — the dementors! When 
we heard — and that Ministry hearin
"g — it’s just outrageous, I’ve "
"looked it all up, they can’t expel you,"
" they just can’t, there’s provision "
in the Decree for the Restriction of
 Underage Sorcery for the use of 
magic in life-threate
ning situations —” 
"“Let him breathe, Hermione,” said"
" Ron, grinning, closing the door "
behind Harry. He seemed to have 
grown several more inches during 
"their month apart, making him talle"
r and more gangly looking than 
"ever, though the long nose, bright re"
"d hair, and freckles were the same. "
"NUMBER  TWELVE, "
   63 "Hermione, still beaming,"
" let go of Harry, but "
before she could say 
another word there was a soft wh
ooshing sound and something white 
soared from the top of a dark ward
robe and landed gently on Harry’s 
shoulder. 
“Hedwig!” 
The snowy owl clicked her beak an
d nibbled his ear affectionately 
as Harry stroked her feathers. 
“She’s been in a right 
"state,” said Ron. “Pecked us half to death "
"when she brought your last letters, look at this —” "
He showed Harry the index finger 
"of his right hand, which sported "
a half-healed but cl
early deep cut. 
"“Oh yeah,” Harry said. “Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, "
you know. . . .” 
"“We wanted to give them to you,"
" mate,” said Ron. “Hermione was "
"going spare, she kept saying you’d do something stupid if you were "
stuck all on your own without ne
"ws, but Dumbledore made us —” "
"“— swear not to tell me,” said "
"Harry. “Yeah, Hermione’s already "
said.” 
The warm glow that had flared in
side him at the sight of his two 
best friends was extinguished as 
something icy floode
d the pit of his 
stomach. All of a sudden — after yearning to see them for a solid 
month — he felt he would rather Ro
n and Hermione left him alone. 
There was a strained silence in 
which Harry stroked Hedwig auto-
"matically, not looking at "
either of the others. 
“He seemed to think it was best
",” said Hermione rather breath-"
"lessly. “Dumbledore, I mean.” "
"“Right,” said Harry. He noticed th"
at her hands too bore the marks 
of Hedwig’s beak an
d found that he wa
s not at 
all sorry. 
“I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles —” Ron 
began. 
"“Yeah?” said Harry, raising his eyeb"
rows. “Have either of you been 
attacked by dement
ors this summer?” 
 64 "“Well, no — but that’s why he’s "
had people from the Order of the 
Phoenix tailing you all the time —” 
Harry felt a great jolt in 
his guts as though he 
had just missed a step 
going downstairs. So everyone had 
known he was being followed ex-
cept him. 
"“Didn’t work that well, though, "
"did it?” said Harry, doing his "
utmost to keep his voice even. “Had
" to look after myself after all, "
didn’t I?” 
"“He was so angry,” said Hermione in an almost awestruck voice. "
“Dumbledore. We saw him. When he
 found out Mundungus had left 
before his shift had en
ded. He was scary.” 
"“Well, I’m glad he left,” Harry said"
" coldly. “If he hadn’t, I wouldn’t "
have done magic and Dumbledore woul
d probably have left me at 
Privet Drive all summer.” 
“Aren’t you . . . aren’t you worried
 about the Ministry of Magic 
hearing?” said Hermione quietly. 
"“No,” Harry lied defiantly. He walked away from them, looking "
"around, with Hedwig nestled content"
"edly on his shoulder, but this "
room was not likely to raise his spir
its. It was dank and dark. A blank 
stretch of canvas in an ornate pict
ure frame was all that relieved the 
bareness of the peeling walls and 
as Harry passed it he thought he 
heard someone lurking ou
t of sight snigger. 
“So why’s Dumbledore been so keen 
to keep me in the dark?” 
"Harry asked, still trying hard to "
keep his voice casual. “Did you — 
er — bother to 
ask him at all?” 
He glanced up just in time to see 
them exchanging a look that told 
him he was behaving just as they ha
d feared he would. It did nothing 
to improve his temper. 
“We told Dumbledore we wanted to
" tell you what was going on,” "
"said Ron. “We did, mate. But he’s really busy now, we’ve only seen "
him twice since we came here and he 
"didn’t have much time, he just  "
"NUMBER  TWELVE, "
   65 made us swear not to tell you import
"ant stuff when we wrote, he said "
the owls might be intercepted —” 
“He could still’ve kept me informed
" if he’d wanted to,” Harry said "
shortly. “You’re not telling me he do
esn’t know ways to send messages 
without owls.” 
Hermione glanced at Ron and then 
"said, “I thought that too. But "
he didn’t want you to know 
anything.
” 
“Maybe he thinks I can’t be truste
"d,” said Harry, wa"
tching their ex-
pressions. 
"“Don’t be thick,” said Ron, looking highly disconcerted. "
“Or that I can’t take 
care of myself —” 
“Of course he doesn’t think that!” said Hermione anxiously. 
“So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys’ while you two get to 
join in everything that’s going on
" here?” said Harry, the words tum-"
"bling over one another in a rush, his"
 voice growing louder with every 
word. “How come you two are allowe
d to know everything that’s go-
ing on — ?” 
“We’re not!” Ron interrupted. “Mum won’t let us near the meet-
"ings, she says we’re too young —” "
"But before he knew it, Harry was shouting. "
"“SO YOU HAVEN’T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG DEAL! "
"YOU’VE STILL BEEN HERE, HAVEN’T YOU? YOU’VE STILL "
"BEEN TOGETHER! ME, I’VE BEEN STUCK AT THE DURS-"
LEYS’ FOR A MONTH! AND I’VE HANDLED MORE THAN 
YOU TWO’VE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE 
KNOWS IT — WHO SAVED THE SORCERER’S STONE? 
WHO GOT RID OF RIDDLE? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR 
SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS?” 
Every bitter and resentful thought 
that Harry had ha
d in the past 
month was pouring out of him; his fr
"ustration at the lack of news, the "
hurt that they had all been together
" without him, his fury at being  "
 66 followed and not told about it: All th
e feelings he was half-ashamed of 
finally burst their boundaries. Hedw
ig took fright at the noise and 
soared off on top of the wardrobe
 again; Pigwidgeon twittered in 
alarm and zoomed even fast
er around their heads. 
“WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES 
AND EVERY OTHER FOUL TH
ING LAST YEAR? WHO SAW 
HIM COME BACK? WHO HAD TO ESCAPE FROM HIM? ME!” 
Ron was standing there with his 
"mouth half-open, clearly stunned "
and at a loss for anything
" to say, while Hermione looked on the verge "
of tears. 
“BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON? WHY 
SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO
 TELL ME WHAT’S BEEN 
HAPPENING?” 
"“Harry, we wanted to te"
"ll you, we really di"
d —” Hermione began. 
"“CAN’T’VE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR "
"YOU’D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT "
DUMBLEDORE 
MADE YOU SWEAR
 —” 
"“Well, he did —” "
"“FOUR WEEKS I’VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, "
NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT 
WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON —” 
“We wanted to —” 
"“I SUPPOSE YOU’VE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH, "
"HAVEN’T YOU, ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER —” "
"“No, honest —” "
"“Harry, we’re really sorry!” said "
"Hermione desperately, her eyes now "
sparkling with tears. “You’re absolu
"tely right, Harry — I’d be furious "
if it was me!” 
"Harry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from "
"them again, pacing up and down. "
Hedwig hooted glumly from the 
top of the wardrobe. There was a 
"long pause, broken only by the "
mournful creak of the floo
rboards below Harry’s feet. 
"NUMBER  TWELVE, "
   67 “What 
is
 this place anyway
?” he shot at 
Ron and Hermione. 
"“Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,” said Ron at once. "
“Is anyone going to bother tell
ing me what the Order of the 
Phoenix — ?” 
"“It’s a secret society,” said He"
rmione quickly. “Dumbledore’s in 
"charge, he founded it. It’s the pe"
ople who fought 
against You-Know-
Who last time.” 
"“Who’s in it?” said Harry, coming "
to a halt with his hands in his 
pockets. 
“Quite a few people —” 
“— we’ve met about twenty of them
",” said Ron, “but we think "
there are more. . . .” 
Harry glared at them. 
“
Well
"?” he demanded, looking from one to the other. "
"“Er,” said Ron. “Well what?” "
“
Voldemort
"!” said Harry furiously, "
and both Ron and Hermione 
winced. “What’s happening? What’s he
 up to? Where is he? What are 
we doing to stop him?” 
“We’ve 
told
" you, the Order don’t let us in on their meetings,” said "
Hermione nervously. “So we don’t know the details — but we’ve got a 
"general idea —” she added hastily, "
seeing the look 
on Harry’s face. 
“Fred and George have invented Ex
"tendable Ears, see,” said Ron. "
“They’re really useful.” 
“Extendable — ?” 
"“Ears, yeah. Only we’ve had to stop using them lately because "
Mum found out and went berserk. Fr
ed and George had to hide them 
all to stop Mum binning them. But 
we got a good bit of use out of 
them before Mum realized what was going on. We know some of the 
Order are following known Death Ea
"ters, keeping tabs on them, you "
know —” 
“— some of them are working on recruiting more people to the 
Order —” said Hermione. 
 68 "“— and some of them are standing guard over something,” said "
Ron. “They’re always ta
lking about guard duty.” 
“Couldn’t have been 
"me, could it?” said "
Harry sarcastically. 
"“Oh yeah,” said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension. "
Harry snorted. He walked around
" the room again, looking any-"
where but at Ron and Hermione. “S
"o what have you two been doing, "
if you’re not allowed in meetings
?” he demanded. “You said you’d 
been busy.” 
"“We have,” said Hermione quickl"
y. “We’ve been decontaminating 
"this house, it’s been empty for ages"
 and stuff’s been breeding in here. 
We’ve managed to clean out the kitc
"hen, most of the bedrooms, and I "
think we’re doing the draw
ing room tomo — AARGH!” 
"With two loud cracks, Fred and Ge"
"orge, Ron’s elder twin brothers, "
had materialized out of thin air 
in the middle of the room. Pigwidg-
eon twittered more wildly than ever
 and zoomed off to join Hedwig 
on top of the wardrobe. 
“Stop 
doing
" that!” Hermione said weakly to the twins, who were as "
"vividly red-haired as Ron, though"
 stockier and slightly shorter. 
"“Hello, Harry,” said George, beam"
ing at him. “We thought we 
heard your du
lcet tones.” 
“You don’t want to bottle up your
" anger like that, Harry, let it all "
"out,” said Fred, also be"
aming. “There might be a couple of people fifty 
miles away who didn’t hear you.” 
"“You two passed your Apparation tests, then?” asked Harry "
grumpily. 
"“With distinction,” said Fred, who "
was holding what looked like a 
"piece of very long, "
flesh-colored string. 
“It would have taken you about thir
ty seconds longer to walk down 
"the stairs,” said Ron. "
"“Time is Galleons, little brother,” said Fred. “Anyway, Harry, you’re "
interfering with reception.
" Extendable Ears,” he added in response to  "
"NUMBER  TWELVE, "
   69 "Harry’s raised eyebrows, holding up"
" the string, which Harry now saw "
was trailing out onto the landing. “W
e’re trying to he
ar what’s going 
on downstairs.” 
"“You want to be careful,” said Ron, staring at the ear. “If Mum sees "
one of them again . . .” 
"“It’s worth the risk, that’s a majo"
"r meeting they’re having,” said "
Fred. 
The door opened and a long ma
ne of red hair appeared. 
"“Oh hello, Harry!” said "
"Ron’s younger sister, "
"Ginny, brightly. “I "
thought I heard 
your voice.” 
Turning to Fred and George she sa
"id, “It’s no go with the Extend-"
"able Ears, she’s gone and put an Im"
perturbable Charm on the kitchen 
door.” 
“How d’you know?” said Ge
"orge, looking "
crestfallen. 
"“Tonks told me how to find out,” "
said Ginny. “You just chuck stuff 
at the door and if it can’t make contact the door’s been Imperturbed. 
I’ve been flicking Dungbombs at it 
from the top of the stairs and they 
"just soar away from it, so there’s "
no way the Extendable Ears will be 
able to get under the gap.” 
Fred heaved a deep sigh. “Shame. 
I really fancied finding out what 
old Snape’s been up to.” 
“Snape?” said Harry quickly. “Is he here?” 
"“Yeah,” said George, carefully clos"
ing the door and sitting down on 
one of the beds; Fred and Ginny followed. “Giving a report. Top 
secret.” 
"“Git,” said Fred idly. "
"“He’s on our side now,” said Hermione reprovingly. "
Ron snorted. “Doesn’t stop him bein
g a git. The way he looks at us 
when he sees us. . . .” 
"“Bill doesn’t like him either,” said"
" Ginny, as though that settled the "
matter. 
 70 Harry was not sure his anger had ab
ated yet; but his thirst for 
information was now overcoming his 
urge to keep shouting. He sank 
onto the bed oppo
site the others. 
“Is Bill here?” he asked. “I thought he was working in Egypt.” 
“He applied for a desk job so he 
could come home and work for the 
"Order,” said Fred. “He says he mi"
"sses the tombs, bu"
"t,” he smirked, "
“there are compensations. . . .” 
“What d’you mean?” 
“Remember old Fleur Delacour?” sa
id George. “She’s got a job at 
Gringotts to 
eemprove ’er Eeenglish
 —” 
“— and Bill’s been giving her a 
"lot of private lessons,” sniggered "
Fred. 
"“Charlie’s in the Order too,” said Ge"
"orge, “but he’s still in Romania, "
Dumbledore wants as many foreign wi
"zards brought in as possible, so "
Charlie’s trying to make contacts on his days off.” 
“Couldn’t Percy do that?” Harry aske
"d. The last he had heard, the "
third Weasley brother was working 
in the Department of Interna-
tional Magical Cooperation at
 the Ministry of Magic. 
At these words all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly 
significant looks. 
"“Whatever you do, don’t mentio"
n Percy in front of Mum and 
"Dad,” Ron told Harry "
in a tense voice. 
“Why not?” 
"“Because every time Percy’s name’s mentioned, Dad breaks what-"
ever he’s holding and Mum st
"arts crying,” Fred said. "
"“It’s been awful,” "
said Ginny sadly. 
"“I think we’re well shut of him,” said George with an uncharacter-"
istically ugly look on his face. 
“What’s happened?” Harry said. 
"“Percy and Dad had a row,” said Fred. “I’ve never seen Dad row "
with anyone like that. It’s no
rmally Mum who shouts. . . .” 
“It was the first week back after 
"term ended,” said Ron. “We were "
"NUMBER  TWELVE, "
   71 about to come and join 
the Order. Percy came home and told us he’d 
been promoted.” 
“You’re kidding?” said Harry. 
Though he knew perfectly well th
"at Percy was highly ambitious, "
Harry’s impression was that Percy ha
d not made a great success of his 
first job at the Ministry of Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large 
oversight of failing to notice that
 his boss was being controlled by 
Lord Voldemort (not that the Mini
stry had believed that — they all 
thought that Mr. Crouch had gone mad). 
"“Yeah, we were all surprised,” said George, “because Percy got into "
"a load of trouble about Crouch, th"
ere was an inquiry and everything. 
They said Percy ought to have real
ized Crouch was off his rocker and 
informed a superior. But you know Pe
"rcy, Crouch left"
" him in charge, "
he wasn’t going to complain. . . .” 
“So how come they
 promoted him?” 
"“That’s exactly what we wondered,” said Ron, who seemed very "
keen to keep normal conversation 
going now that Harry had stopped 
yelling. “He came home really 
pleased with himself — even more 
pleased than usual if you can imagine that — and told Dad he’d been 
offered a position in Fudge’s own office. A really good one for some-
one only a year out of Hogwarts — 
Junior Assistant to the Minister. 
He expected Dad to be 
"all impressed, I think.” "
"“Only Dad wasn’t,” said Fred grimly. "
“Why not?” said Harry. 
"“Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry "
checking that nobody’s having an
"y contact with Dumbledore,” said "
George. 
“Dumbledore’s name’s mud with the 
"Ministry these days, see,” said "
Fred. “They all think he’s just making trouble saying You-Know-
Who’s back.” 
“Dad says Fudge has made it clear 
that anyone who’s in league with 
Dumbledore can clear out th
"eir desks,” said George. "
 72 "“Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he’s friendly with Dum-"
"bledore, and he’s always thought Dad’s a bit of a weirdo because of his "
Muggle obsession —” 
“But what’s this got 
to do with Percy?” as
"ked Harry, confused. "
“I’m coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his 
office because he wants to use 
him to spy on the family — and 
Dumbledore.” 
Harry let out a low whistle. 
“Bet Percy loved that.” 
Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way. 
"“He went completely berserk. He said — well, he said loads of ter-"
rible stuff. He said he’s been havi
ng to struggle against Dad’s lousy 
reputation ever since he joined th
e Ministry and that Dad’s got no 
ambition and that’s why we’ve always been — you know — not had a 
"lot of money, I mean —” "
“
What
"?” said Harry in disbelief, as "
Ginny made a noise like an an-
gry cat. 
"“I know,” said Ron in a low voice."
 “And it got worse. He said Dad 
was an idiot to run around with
" Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was "
heading for big trouble and Dad was 
"going to go down with him, and "
that he — Percy — knew where his 
loyalty lay and it was with the 
Ministry. And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the 
Ministry he was going to make sure
 everyone knew he didn’t belong 
to our family anymore. And he pa
cked his bags the same night and 
left. He’s living here in London now.” 
Harry swore under his breath. He ha
d always liked Percy least of 
"Ron’s brothers, but he had never im"
agined he would say such things 
to Mr. Weasley. 
"“Mum’s been in a right state,” said"
 Ron. “You know — crying and 
stuff. She came up to London to 
try and talk to Perc
y but he slammed 
the door in her face. I dunno what he
 does if he meets Dad at work — 
"ignores him, I s’pose.” "
"NUMBER  TWELVE, "
   73 “But Percy 
must
" know Voldemort’s back,” said Harry slowly. “He’s "
"not stupid, he must know your "
mum and dad wouldn’t risk every-
thing without proof —” 
"“Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,” said Ron, shoot-"
ing Harry a furtive look. “Percy said the only evidence was your word 
and . . . I dunno . . 
. he didn’t think it
 was good enough.” 
“Percy takes the 
Daily Prophet
" seriously,” said Hermione tartly, and "
the others all nodded. 
“What are you talking about?” Ha
"rry asked, looking around at "
them all. They were all regarding him warily. 
“Haven’t — haven’t you been getting the 
Daily Prophet
?” Hermi-
one asked nervously. 
"“Yeah, I have!” said Harry. "
“Have you — er — been reading it thoroughly?” Hermione asked 
still more anxiously. 
"“Not cover to cover,” "
said Harry defensively. “If they were going 
to report anything about Voldem
"ort it would be headline news, "
wouldn’t it!” 
The others flinched at the soun
d of the name. Hermione hurried 
"on, “Well, you’d need to read it "
"cover to cover to pick it up, but "
they — um — they me
ntion you a couple of times a week.” 
“But I’d have seen —” 
"“Not if you’ve only been reading the front page, you wouldn’t,” said "
"Hermione, shaking her head. “I’m no"
t talking about big articles. They 
"just slip you in, like you’re a standing joke.” "
“What d’you — ?” 
"“It’s quite nasty, actually,” said "
Hermione in a voice of forced calm. 
“They’re just building
 on Rita’s stuff.” 
“But she’s not writing for 
"them anymore, is she?” "
"“Oh no, she’s kept her promise — "
"not that she’s got any choice,” "
Hermione added with satisfaction. 
“But she laid the foundation for 
what they’re trying to do now.” 
 74 “Which is 
what
?”
said Harry impatiently. 
"“Okay, you know she wrote that "
you were collapsing all over the 
place and saying your scar 
was hurting and all that?” 
"“Yeah,” said Harry, who was not like"
ly to forget Ri
ta Skeeter’s sto-
ries about him in a hurry. 
"“Well, they’re writing about you as"
" though you’re this deluded, "
attention-seeking person who thinks 
he’s a great tragic hero or some-
"thing,” said Hermione, very fast, as "
though it would be less unpleasant 
for Harry to hear these facts quickl
y. “They keep sl
ipping in snide 
comments about you. If some far-fetched story appears they say some-
thing like ‘a tale worthy of Harry Potter’ and if anyone has a funny 
accident or anything it’s ‘let’s hope 
he hasn’t got a scar on his forehead 
or we’ll be asked to 
worship him next —’” 
“I don’t want anyone to wo
rship —” Harry began hotly. 
"“I know you don’t,” said Hermio"
"ne quickly, looking frightened. "
“I 
"know,"
 Harry. But you see what they’r
e doing? They want to turn 
you into someone nobody will beli
"eve. Fudge is behind it, I’ll bet "
anything. They want wizards on the 
street to think you’re just some 
"stupid boy who’s a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous tall stories because "
he loves being famous and wants to keep it going.” 
“I didn’t ask — I didn’t want — 
Voldemort killed my parents
!” 
Harry spluttered. “I got 
famous because he murd
ered my family but 
couldn’t kill me! Who wa
nts to be famous for 
that? Don’t they think 
I’d rather it’d never —” 
“We 
"know,"
" Harry,” said Ginny earnestly. "
"“And of course, they didn’t report a word about the dementors at-"
"tacking you,” said Hermione. “Som"
eone’s told them 
to keep that 
quiet. That should’ve been a really
" big story, out-of-control demen-"
tors. They haven’t even reported 
that you broke the International 
Statute of Secrecy — we thought they
" would, it would tie in so well "
with this image of you as some stupid show-off — we think they’re  
"NUMBER  TWELVE, "
   75 biding their time until you’re expell
"ed, then they’re really going to go "
"to town — I mean, "
if
" you’re expelled, obviously,” she went on hastily, "
"“you really shouldn’t be, not if they"
" abide by their own laws, there’s no "
case against you.” 
They were back on the hearing 
and Harry did not want to think 
"about it. He cast around for another change of subject, but was saved "
the necessity of finding one by the 
sound of footsteps coming up the 
stairs. 
“Uh-oh.” 
Fred gave the Extendable Ear a he
arty tug; there was another loud 
"crack and he and George vanished. Seconds later, Mrs. Weasley ap-"
peared in the bedroom doorway. 
"“The meeting’s over, you can co"
"me down and have dinner now, "
"everyone’s dying to see you, Harry."
 And who’s left all those Dung-
bombs outside the kitchen door?” 
"“Crookshanks,” said Ginny unblus"
hingly. “He loves playing with 
them.” 
"“Oh,” said Mrs. Weasley, “I thou"
"ght it might have been Kreacher, "
he keeps doing odd things like that
. Now don’t forget to keep your 
"voices down in the hall. Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you "
been doing? Go and 
"wash them before dinner, please. . . .” "
Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the 
"room, leaving Harry alone with Ron "
and Hermione again. Both of 
them were watching him apprehensively
", as though they feared that he "
would start shouting again now that 
everyone else had gone. The sight 
of them looking so nervous made
 him feel slightly ashamed. 
"“Look . . .” he muttered, but "
"Ron shook his head, and Hermione "
"said quietly, “We knew you’d be an"
"gry, Harry, we re"
ally don’t blame 
"you, but you’ve got to understand, we "
did
 try and persuade Dumble-
dore —” 
"“Yeah, I know,” said"
 Harry grudgingly. 
 76 He cast around for a topic to 
change the subject from Dumble-
dore — the very thought of him made Harry’s insides burn with 
anger again. 
“Who’s Kreacher?” he asked. 
"“The house-elf who lives here,” said Ron. “Nutter. Never met one "
like him.” 
Hermione frowned at Ron. 
“He’s not a 
"nutter,"
 Ron —” 
“His life’s ambition is to have hi
s head cut off and stuck up on a 
"plaque just like his mother,” said"
 Ron irritably. 
"“Is that normal, "
Hermione?” 
"“Well — well, if he is a bit st"
"range, it’s not his fault —” "
Ron rolled his eyes at Harry. 
“Hermione still hasn’t given up on 
spew
 —” 
“It’s not ‘spew’!” said Hermione 
heatedly. “It’s the Society for the 
"Promotion of Elfish Welfare, and it’s"
" not just me, Dumbledore says we "
should be kind to Kreacher too —” 
"“Yeah, yeah,” said Ron."
" “C’mon, I’m starving.” "
"He led the way out of the door and onto the landing, but before "
they could descend the st
airs — “Hold it!” Ron 
"breathed, flinging out "
an arm to stop Harry and Hermio
ne walking any farther. “They’re 
"still in the hall, we might be"
 able to hear something —” 
The three of them looked cautiously over the banisters. The gloomy 
hallway below was packed with witc
"hes and wizards, including all of "
Harry’s guard. They were whispering
 excitedly together. In the very 
center of the group Harry saw the da
"rk, greasy-haired head and promi-"
"nent nose of his least favorite teacher at Hogwarts, Professor Snape. "
Harry leaned farther over the banisters. He was very interested in what 
Snape was doing for the Orde
r of the Phoenix. . . . 
A thin piece of flesh-colored stri
ng descended in front of Harry’s 
eyes. Looking up he saw Fred and 
"George on the landing above, cau-"
tiously lowering the Extendable Ear 
toward the dark knot of people 
"NUMBER  TWELVE, "
   77 "below. A moment later, however, th"
ey began to move toward the front 
door and out of sight. 
"“Dammit,” Harry heard Fred"
" whisper, as he hoisted the Extendable "
Ear back up again. 
They heard the front door
 open and then close. 
"“Snape never eats here,” Ron to"
ld Harry quietly. “Thank God. 
C’mon.” 
“And don’t forget to keep your
" voice down in the hall, Harry,” "
Hermione whispered. 
As they passed the row of house-elf heads on the wall they saw 
"Lupin, Mrs. Weasley, and Tonks at the front door, magically sealing its "
many locks and bolts behind 
those who had 
just left. 
“We’re eating down in the kitc
"hen,” Mrs. Weasley whispered, "
meeting them at the bottom of the st
"airs. “Harry, dear, if you’ll just "
"tiptoe across the hall, it’s"
 through this door here —” 
CRASH.
“
Tonks
"!” cried Mrs. Weasley exasperatedly, turning to look behind "
her. 
"“I’m sorry!” wailed Tonks, who was ly"
ing flat on the floor. “It’s that 
"stupid umbrella stand, that’s the "
second time I’ve 
tripped over —” 
But the rest of her words were dr
"owned by a horrible, earsplitting, "
bloodcurdling screech. 
The moth-eaten velvet
 curtains Harry had pa
ssed earlier had flown 
"apart, but there was no door behind"
" them. For a split second, Harry "
thought he was looking through 
"a window, a window behind which "
an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though 
she was being tortured — then he real
ized it was simply a life-size por-
"trait, but the most realistic, and th"
"e most unpleasant, he had ever seen "
in his life. 
"The old woman was drooling, her ey"
"es were rolling, the yellowing "
skin of her face stretched taut as 
"she screamed, and all along the hall "
"behind them, the other portraits awok"
"e and began to yell too, so that "
 78 Harry actually screwed up his eyes 
at the noise and clapped his hands 
over his ears. 
Lupin and Mrs. Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the cur-
"tains shut over the old woman, but they would not close and she "
"screeched louder than ever, brandi"
shing clawed hands as though try-
ing to tear at their faces. 
“
Filth! Scum! By-products of dirt an
"d vileness! Half-breeds, mutants, "
"freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my "
fathers
 —” 
Tonks apologized over and over ag
"ain, at the same time dragging "
"the huge, heavy troll’s leg back off the floor. Mrs. Weasley abandoned "
the attempt to close the curtains 
"and hurried up and down the hall, "
Stunning all the other portraits wi
th her wand. Then a man with long 
black hair came charging ou
t of a door facing Harry. 
"“Shut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!” he roared, seizing the "
curtain Mrs. Weasle
y had abandoned. 
The old woman’s face blanched. 
“
Yoooou
"!” she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of the man. "
“
"Blood traitor, abominatio"
"n, shame of my flesh"
!” 
“I said — shut — UP!” roared 
"the man, and with a stupendous ef-"
fort he and Lupin managed to fo
rce the curtains closed again. 
The old woman’s screeches died 
and an echoing silence fell. 
"Panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes, "
"Harry’s godfather, Sirius"
", turned to face him. "
"“Hello, Harry,” he said grimly, “I see you’ve met my mother.” "
our — ?” 
"“My dear old mum, yeah,” said"
 Sirius. “We’ve been trying 
to get her down for a month but we
 think she put a Permanent Stick-
"ing Charm on the back of the canvas. Let’s get downstairs, quick, "
before they all 
wake up again.” 
“But what’s a portrait of your 
"mother doing here?” Harry asked, "
"bewildered, as they went through "
the door from the hall and led the 
way down a flight of narro
"w stone steps, the othe"
rs just behind them. 
“Hasn’t anyone told you? This was 
"my parents’ house,” said Sirius. "
"“But I’m the last Black left, so it’s "
mine now. I offered it to Dumbledore 
for headquarters — about 
the only useful thing I’
ve been able to do.” 
"Harry, who had expected a better"
" welcome, noted how hard and "
bitter Sirius’s voice sounded. He 
followed his godfather to the bottom 
of the stairs and through a door le
ading into the ba
sement kitchen. 
"It was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above, a cavernous room "
with rough stone walls. Most of the 
light was coming from a large fire 
at the far end of the r
oom. A haze of pipe smok
e hung in the air like 
"battle fumes, through which loomed"
 the menacing shapes of heavy 
Y 
 80 iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling. Many chairs had 
been crammed into the room for th
e meeting and a long wooden table 
"stood in the middle of the room, litter"
ed with rolls of
" parchment, gob-"
"lets, empty wine bottles, and a heap of what appeared to be rags. Mr. "
"Weasley and his eldest son, Bill, were talking quietly with their heads "
together at the en
d of the table. 
"Mrs. Weasley cleared her throat. Her husband, a thin, balding, red-"
"haired man, who wore horn-rimme"
"d glasses, looked around and "
jumped to his feet. 
"“Harry!” Mr. Weasley said, hur"
rying forward to greet him and 
shaking his hand vigorous
ly. “Good to see you!” 
"Over his shoulder Harry saw Bill, wh"
o still wore his long hair in a 
"ponytail, hastily rolling up the length"
s of parchment left on the table. 
"“Journey all right, Harry?” Bill call"
"ed, trying to gather up twelve "
"scrolls at once. “Mad-Eye didn’t make you come via Greenland, "
then?” 
"“He tried,” said Tonks, striding "
over to help Bill and immediately 
sending a candle toppling onto th
e last piece of parchment. “Oh 
no — 
sorry
 —” 
"“Here, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she re-"
paired the parchment with
 a wave of her wand: In the flash of light 
"caused by Mrs. Weasley’s charm,"
 Harry caught a glimpse of what 
looked like the plan of a building. 
Mrs. Weasley had seen him looking.
 She snatched the plan off the 
table and stuffed it into 
Bill’s heavily laden arms. 
“This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of 
"meetings,” she snapped before sweep"
ing off toward an ancient dresser 
from which she started un
loading dinner plates. 
"Bill took out his wand, muttered “"
Evanesco
!”
and the scrolls 
vanished. 
"“Sit down, Harry,” said Sirius. "
"“You’ve met Mundungus, haven’t "
you?” 
  81 The thing Harry had taken to be a pi
"le of rags gave a prolonged, "
grunting snore and then jerked awake. 
“Some’n say m’ name?” Mundungus mumbled sleepily. “I ’gree 
with Sirius. . . .” 
He raised a very grubby
" hand in the air as though voting, his "
"droopy, bloodshot eyes un"
focused. Ginny giggled. 
"“The meeting’s over, Dung,” said"
" Sirius, as they all sat down "
around him at the table. “Harry’s arrived.” 
"“Eh?” said Mundungus, peering "
balefully at Harry through his 
"matted ginger hair. “Blimey, so ’e ’as. Yeah . . . you all right, ’arry?” "
"“Yeah,” said Harry. "
Mundungus fumbled nervously in 
"his pockets, still staring at "
"Harry, and pulled out a grimy black pi"
"pe. He stuck it in his mouth, "
ignited the end of it with his wand
", and took a deep pull on it. Great "
billowing clouds of greenish smoke obscured him in seconds. 
"“Owe you a ’pology,” grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly "
cloud. 
"“For the last time, Mundungus,” "
"called Mrs. Weasley, “will you "
please 
not
 smoke that thing in the kitc
"hen, especially not when we’re "
about to eat!” 
"“Ah,” said Mundungus. "
"“Right. Sorry, Molly.” "
The cloud of smoke vanished as 
Mundungus stowed his pipe back 
"in his pocket, but an acrid sm"
ell of burning socks lingered. 
“And if you want dinner before mi
"dnight I’ll need a hand,” Mrs. "
"Weasley said to the room at large. “No, you can stay where you are, "
"Harry dear, you’ve ha"
d a long journey —” 
"“What can I do, Molly?” said Tonk"
"s enthusiastically, bounding for-"
ward. 
"Mrs. Weasley hesitated, looking apprehensive. "
"“Er — no, it’s all righ"
"t, Tonks, you have a "
"rest too, you’ve done "
enough today —” 
"“No, no, I want to help!” said To"
"nks brightly, knocking over a chair "
 82 as she hurried toward the dresser 
from which Ginny was collecting 
cutlery. 
Soon a series of heavy knives were
 chopping meat and vegetables of 
"their own accord, supervised by "
"Mr. Weasley, while Mrs. Weasley "
stirred a cauldron dangling over the 
"fire and the others took out plates, "
"more goblets, and food from the pa"
ntry. Harry was left at the table 
"with Sirius and Mundungus, who "
was still blinking mournfully at 
him. 
“Seen old Figgy si
nce?” he asked. 
"“No,” said Harry, “I haven’t seen anyone.” "
"“See, I wouldn’t ’ave left,” said"
" Mundungus, leaning forward, a "
"pleading note in his voice, “but"
 I ’ad a business opportunity —” 
Harry felt something brush against his
" knees and started, but it was "
"only Crookshanks, Hermione’s band"
"y-legged ginger cat, who wound "
"himself once around Harry’s legs, pu"
"rring, then jumped onto Sirius’s "
lap and curled up. Sirius scratc
hed him absentmindedly behind the 
"ears as he turned, stil"
"l grim-faced, to Harry. "
“Had a good summer so far?” 
"“No, it’s been lousy,” said Harry. "
"For the first time, something like a "
grin flitted across
 Sirius’s face. 
“Don’t know what you’re co
"mplaining about, myself.” "
“
What
?” said Harry incredulously. 
"“Personally, I’d have welcomed a dementor attack. A deadly strug-"
gle for my soul would have broken
 the monotony ni
cely. You think 
"you’ve had it bad, at least you’ve"
" been able to get out and about, "
"stretch your legs, get into a few fights. . . . I’ve been stuck inside for a "
month.” 
“How come?” asked 
"Harry, frowning. "
"“Because the Ministry of Magic’s still after me, and Voldemort will "
"know all about me being an Animagus by now, Wormtail will have "
"told him, so my big disguise is us"
eless. There’s not much I can do for 
the Order of the Phoenix . . 
. or so Dumb
ledore feels.” 
  83 There was something about the slig
htly flattened tone of voice in 
which Sirius uttered Dumbledore’s na
me that told Harry that Sirius 
was not very happy with the head
master either. Harry felt a sudden 
upsurge of affection for his godfather. 
"“At least you’ve known what’s been going on,” he said bracingly. "
"“Oh yeah,” said Sirius "
sarcastically. “Listening
" to Snape’s reports, "
having to take all his snide hints th
at he’s out there risking his life 
while I’m sat on my backside here ha
ving a nice comfortable time . . . 
asking me how the cleaning’s going —” 
“What cleaning?” asked Harry. 
“Trying to make this place fit fo
"r human habitation,” said Sirius, "
waving a hand around the dismal 
kitchen. “No one’
s lived here for 
"ten years, not since my dear mother died, unless you count her old "
"house-elf, and he’s gone round the "
"twist, hasn’t cleaned anything in "
ages —” 
"“Sirius?” said Mundungus, who di"
d not appear to have paid any 
"attention to this conversation, bu"
t had been minutely examining an 
empty goblet. “This so
"lid silver, mate?” "
"“Yes,” said Sirius, surveying it "
with distaste. “Finest fifteenth-
"century goblin-wrought silver, embo"
ssed with the Black family crest.” 
"“That’d come off, though,” mu"
"ttered Mundungus, polishing it "
with his cuff. 
"“Fred — George — NO, JUST "
CARRY THEM!” Mrs. Weasley 
shrieked. 
"Harry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked"
" around and, a split second "
"later, dived away from the table."
 Fred and George had bewitched a 
"large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy "
"wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air "
toward them. The stew skidded the l
ength of the table and came to a 
"halt just before the end, leaving "
a long black burn on the wooden sur-
"face, the flagon of butterbeer fell wi"
"th a crash, spilling its contents "
"everywhere, and the bread knife sl"
"ipped off the board and landed, "
 84 "point down and quivering ominously,"
 exactly where Sirius’s right 
hand had been seconds before. 
“FOR HEAVEN’S SAKE!” screamed Mrs. Weasley. “THERE 
WAS NO NEED — I’VE HAD EN
OUGH OF THIS — JUST BE-
CAUSE YOU’RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW YOU 
DON’T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY 
TINY LITTLE THING!” 
“We were just trying to save a bit 
"of time!” said Fred, hurrying for-"
ward and wrenching the bread knife 
"out of the table. “Sorry Sirius, "
mate — didn’t 
mean to —” 
Harry and Sirius were both laug
"hing. Mundungus, who had top-"
"pled backward off his chair, was swea"
ring as he got to his feet. Crook-
shanks had given an angry hiss and 
"shot off under the dresser, from "
whence his large yellow eyes
 glowed in the darkness. 
"“Boys,” Mr. Weasley said, lifting th"
e stew back into the middle of 
"the table, “your mother’s right, you’re supposed to show a sense of re-"
sponsibility now you’
ve come of age —” 
“— none of your brothers caused
 this sort of trouble!” Mrs. 
"Weasley raged at the twins, slamming a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto "
the table and spilling almost as much
 again. “Bill didn’t feel the need 
to Apparate every few feet! Charlie 
didn’t Charm everything he met! 
Percy —” 
"She stopped dead, catching her breath"
 with a frightened look at her 
"husband, whose expressi"
on was suddenly wooden. 
"“Let’s eat,” said Bill quickly. "
"“It looks wonderful, Molly,” said "
"Lupin, ladling stew onto a plate "
for her and handing it across the table. 
For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and 
cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their 
food. Then Mrs. Weasley turned to 
"Sirius and said, “I’ve been mean-"
"ing to tell you, there’s something tr"
apped in that writing desk in the 
"drawing room, it keeps ra"
"ttling and shaking. Of course, it could just "
  85 "be a boggart, but I thought we ought "
to ask Alastor to have a look at 
it before we let it out.” 
"“Whatever you like,” said"
 Sirius indifferently. 
“The curtains in ther
e are full of doxies t
"oo,” Mrs. Weasley went "
on. “I thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow.” 
"“I look forward to it,” said Sirius. Harry heard the sarcasm in his "
"voice, but he was not sure"
 that anyone else did. 
"Opposite Harry, Tonks was enter"
taining Hermione and Ginny by 
transforming her nose between mouthf
uls. Screwing up her eyes each 
time with the same pained expressi
on she had worn back in Harry’s 
"bedroom, her nose swelled to a beak"
"like protuberance like Snape’s, "
shrank to something resembli
"ng a button mushroom, and then "
sprouted a great deal of hair from 
each nostril. Apparently this was a 
"regular mealtime entertainment, be"
cause after a while Hermione and 
Ginny started requesting 
their favorite noses. 
“Do that one like a pi
"g snout, Tonks . . .” "
"Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking "
"up, had the fleeting impression "
that a female Dudley was grinning
 at him from across the table. 
"Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin were having an intense discussion "
about goblins. 
“They’re not giving anything away ye
"t,” said Bill. “I still can’t work "
out whether they believe he’s back or
" not. ’Course, they might prefer "
not to take sides at all. Keep out of it.” 
"“I’m sure they’d never go over to You-Know-Who,” said Mr. "
"Weasley, shaking his head. “They’"
ve suffered losses too. Remember 
that goblin family he murder
"ed last time, somewhere near "
Nottingham?” 
“I think it depends what they’re o
"ffered,” said Lupin. “And I’m not "
talking about gold; if they’re o
ffered freedoms we’ve been denying 
them for centuries they’re going to 
be tempted. Have you still not had 
"any luck with Ragnok, Bill?” "
“He’s feeling pretty anti-wizard at
" the moment,” said Bill. “He "
 86 hasn’t stopped raging 
"about the Bagman business, he reckons the "
"Ministry did a cover-up, those goblin"
"s never got their gold from him, "
you know —” 
A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of 
"Bill’s words. Fred, George, Ron, and Mundungus were rolling around "
in their seats. 
"“. . . and then,” choked Mundungus, tears running down his face, "
"“and then, if you’ll believe it, ’e says"
" to me, ’e says, ‘’ere, Dung, where "
didja get all them toads from? ’Cos
 some son of a Bludger’s gone and 
"nicked all mine!’ And I says, ‘Nicke"
"d all your toads, Will, what next? "
"So you’ll be wanting some more, th"
"en?’ And if you’ll believe me, lads, "
the gormless gargoyle buys all ’is own toads back orf me for twice what 
’e paid in the first place —” 
“I don’t think we need to hear an
"y more of your business dealings, "
"thank you very much, Mundungus,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as "
Ron slumped forward on
"to the table, howling with laughter. "
"“Beg pardon, Molly,” said Mundungus at once, wiping his eyes and "
"winking at Harry. “But, you know, "
Will nicked ’em orf Warty Harris 
in the first place so
 I wasn’t really doing nothing wrong —” 
“I don’t know where you learned 
"about right and wrong, Mundun-"
"gus, but you seem to have missed "
"a few crucial lessons,” said Mrs. "
Weasley coldly. 
Fred and George buried their face
s in their goblets of butterbeer; 
George was hiccuping. For some re
"ason, Mrs. Weasley threw a very "
nasty look at Sirius before getting 
to her feet and going to fetch a large 
rhubarb crumble for pudding. Harry 
looked round at his godfather. 
“Molly doesn’t approve of Mund
"ungus,” said Sirius in an "
undertone. 
“How come he’s in
 the Order?” Harry 
said very quietly. 
"“He’s useful,” Sirius muttered. “Knows all the crooks — well, he "
"would, seeing as he’s "
one himself. But he’s also
 very loyal to Dumble- 
  87 "dore, who helped him out of a tight "
spot once. It pays to have some-
"one like Dung around, he hears t"
hings we don’t. But Molly thinks 
inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far. She hasn’t forgiven him 
for slipping off duty when he wa
s supposed to be tailing you.” 
Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waist-
band on Harry’s jeans was feeling 
uncomfortably tight (which was 
"saying something, as the jeans ha"
d once been Dudley’s). He lay down 
his spoon in a lull in the general 
conversation. Mr. Weasley was lean-
"ing back in his chair, looking repl"
"ete and relaxed, Tonks was yawning "
"widely, her nose now back to "
"normal, and Ginny, who had lured "
Crookshanks out from under the dre
"sser, was sitting cross-legged on "
"the floor, rolling butterbeer corks for him to chase. "
"“Nearly time for bed, I think,” said Mrs. Weasley on a yawn. "
"“Not just yet, Molly,” said Sirius"
", pushing away his empty plate and "
turning to look at Harr
"y. “You know, I’m surprised at you. I thought "
the first thing you’d do when you got 
here would be to start asking 
questions about Voldemort.” 
The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry as-
sociated with the arrival of dement
ors. Where seconds before it had 
"been sleepily relaxed, it was now aler"
"t, even tense. A frisson had gone "
around the table at the mention 
"of Voldemort’s name. Lupin, who "
"had been about to take a sip of wine,"
" lowered his goblet slowly, look-"
ing wary. 
“I did!” said Harry indignantly. 
“I asked Ron and Hermione but 
"they said we’re not allowed in the Order, so —” "
"“And they’re quite right,” said Mrs. Weasley. “You’re too young.” "
She was sitting bolt upright in her 
"chair, her fists clenched upon its "
"arms, every trace of drowsiness gone. "
“Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to 
ask questions?” asked Sirius. “Harry’s been trapped in that Muggle 
house for a month. He’s got the right to know what’s been happen —” 
 88 “Hang on!” interrup
ted George loudly. 
“How come Harry gets 
his questions answered?”
 said Fred angrily. 
“
We’ve
 been trying to get stuff ou
t of you for a month and you 
haven’t told us a single st
inking thing!” said George. 
“‘
"You’re too young, you’re not in the Order,"
’”
"said Fred, in a high-"
pitched voice that sounded uncannil
y like his mother’s. “Harry’s not 
even of age!” 
“It’s not my fault you haven’t been
" told what the Order’s doing,” "
said Sirius calmly. “That’s your pa
"rents’ decision. Harry, on the other "
hand —” 
“It’s not down to you to decide what’s good for Harry!” said Mrs. 
Weasley sharply. Her normally kind
ly face looked dangerous. “You 
haven’t forgotten what Du
"mbledore said, I suppose?” "
"“Which bit?” Sirius asked politely, but with an air as though ready-"
ing himself for a fight. 
“The bit about not tell
ing Harry more than he 
"needs to know,"
” said 
"Mrs. Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words. "
"Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George’s"
 heads turned from Sirius to 
Mrs. Weasley as though following 
a tennis rally. Ginny was kneeling 
amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer 
"corks, watching the conversation "
with her mouth slightly open. Lupi
n’s eyes were fixed on Sirius. 
“I don’t intend to tell him more than he 
needs to know
", Molly,” said "
Sirius. “But as he was the one wh
"o saw Voldemort come back” (again, "
there was a collective shudder around
" the table at the name), “he has "
more right than most to —” 
“He’s not a member of the Orde
r of the Phoenix!” said Mrs. 
Weasley. “He’s only fifteen and —” 
“— and he’s dealt with as much as
" most in the Order,” said Sirius, "
“and more than some —” 
“No one’s denying what he’s done!” 
"said Mrs. Weasley, her voice ris-"
"ing, her fists trembling on the arms "
of her chair. “But
 he’s still —” 
“He’s not a child!” said
 Sirius impatiently. 
  89 “He’s not an adult either!” said Mrs.
" Weasley, the color rising in her "
cheeks. “He’s not 
"James,"
 Sirius!” 
“I’m perfectly clear wh
"o he is, thanks, Molly,"
” said Sirius coldly. 
“I’m not sure you are!” said Mrs.
" Weasley. “Sometimes, the way you "
"talk about him, it’s as though you "
think you’ve got your best friend 
back!” 
“What’s wrong with that?” said Harry. 
"“What’s wrong, Harry, is that you are "
not
" your father, however "
much you might look like him!” said
" Mrs. Weasley, her eyes still bor-"
ing into Sirius. “You are still at sc
hool and adults responsible for you 
should not forget it!” 
"“Meaning I’m an irresponsible godfather?” demanded Sirius, his "
voice rising. 
"“Meaning you’ve been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why "
Dumbledore keeps reminding you 
to stay at home and —” 
“We’ll leave my instructions from
" Dumbledore out of this, if you "
please!” said Sirius loudly. 
"“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley, roun"
"ding on her husband. “Arthur, "
back me up!” 
Mr. Weasley did not speak at once. He took off his glasses and 
"cleaned them slowly on his robes, "
not looking at his wife. Only when 
he had replaced them carefully on 
"his nose did he say, “Dumbledore "
"knows the position has changed, Mo"
lly. He accepts that Harry will 
have to be filled in to a certain ext
ent now that he is staying at head-
quarters —” 
"“Yes, but there’s a difference betwe"
en that and inviting him to ask 
whatever he likes!” 
"“Personally,” said Lupin quietly, look"
"ing away from Sirius at last, as "
"Mrs. Weasley turned quickly to him, hopeful that finally she was about "
"to get an ally, “I think it better th"
at Harry gets the 
facts — not all the 
"facts, Molly, but the general picture — from us, rather than a garbled "
version from . . . others.” 
 90 "His expression was mild, but Harry "
"felt sure that Lupin, at least, "
knew that some Extendable Ears ha
d survived Mrs. Weasley’s purge. 
"“Well,” said Mrs. Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around "
the table for support that did not co
"me, “well . . . I can see I’m going "
to be overruled. I’ll just say t
his: Dumbledore must have had his rea-
"sons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as some-"
one who has got Harry’s best
 interests at heart —” 
"“He’s not your son,” sa"
id Sirius quietly. 
"“He’s as good as,” said Mrs. Weasle"
y fiercely. “Who else has he got?” 
“He’s got me!” 
"“Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley, her lip "
"curling. “The thing is, it’s been "
rather difficult for you to look afte
r him while you’ve been locked up 
"in Azkaban, hasn’t it?” "
Sirius started to ri
se from his chair. 
"“Molly, you’re not the only person at this table who cares about "
"Harry,” said Lupin sharply. “Sirius, sit "
down.
” 
Mrs. Weasley’s lower lip was trembling. Sirius sank slowly back into 
"his chair, his face white. "
“I think Harry ought to 
be allowed a say in t
"his,” Lupin continued. "
“He’s old enough to 
decide for himself.” 
“I want to know what’s been 
"going on,” Harry said at once. "
He did not look at Mrs. Weasley.
 He had been touched by what she 
had said about his being 
"as good as a son, but he"
 was also impatient at 
her mollycoddling. . . . Si
"rius was right, he was "
not
 a child. 
"“Very well,” said Mrs. Weasley,"
 her voice cracking. “Ginny — 
Ron — Hermione — Fred — George — I want you out of this 
"kitchen, now.” "
There was instant uproar. 
“We’re of age!” Fred and George bellowed together. 
"“If Harry’s allowed, why can’t I?” shouted Ron. "
"“Mum, I "
want
 to!” wailed Ginny. 
  91 "“NO!” shouted Mrs. Weasley, standing up, her eyes overbright. “I "
absolutely forbid —” 
"“Molly, you can’t stop Fred and George,” said Mr. Weasley wearily. "
“They 
are
 of age —” 
“They’re still at school —” 
"“But they’re legally adults now,” sa"
id Mr. Weasley in the same tired 
voice. 
Mrs. Weasley was now scarlet in the face. 
"“I — oh, all right then, Fred an"
"d George can stay, but Ron —” "
“Harry’ll tell me and Hermione ev
erything you say anyway!” said 
"Ron hotly. “Won’t — won’t you?” he added uncertainly, meeting "
Harry’s eyes. 
"For a split second, Harry "
considered telling Ro
n that he wouldn’t 
"tell him a single word, that he coul"
d try a taste of being kept in the 
dark and see how he liked it. But the nasty impulse vanished as they 
looked at each other. 
"“’Course I will,” Harry said. Ron and Hermione beamed. "
“Fine!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “Fine! Ginny — BED!” 
Ginny did not go quietly. They coul
d hear her raging and storming 
at her mother all the way up the st
"airs, and when she reached the hall "
Mrs. Black’s earsplitting shrieks we
re added to the din. Lupin hurried 
off to the portrait to restore calm. 
"It was only after he had returned, "
closing the kitchen door behind him 
and taking his seat at the table 
"again, that Si"
rius spoke. 
"“Okay, Harry . . . what "
do you want to know?” 
Harry took a deep breath and aske
d the question that had been ob-
sessing him for a month. 
“Where’s Voldemort? What’s he 
doing? I’ve been trying to watch 
"the Muggle news,” he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces "
"at the name, “and there hasn’t been "
"anything that looks like him yet, "
no funny deaths or anything —” 
 92 “That’s because there haven’t been 
"any suspicious deaths yet,” said "
"Sirius, “not as far as we know, anyw"
ay. . . . And we know quite a lot.” 
“More than he thinks we 
"do anyway,” said Lupin. "
“How come he’s stopped killing 
people?” Harry asked. He knew 
that Voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone. 
“Because he doesn’t want to draw
 attention to him
self at the mo-
"ment,” said Sirius. “It would be"
 dangerous for him. His comeback 
didn’t come off quite the way he wa
"nted it to, you see. He messed it "
up.” 
"“Or rather, you messed it up for "
"him,” said Lupin with a satisfied "
smile. 
“How?” Harry asked perplexedly. 
“You weren’t supposed to survive!” 
said Sirius. “Nobody apart from 
his Death Eaters was supposed to kn
ow he’d come back. But you sur-
vived to bear witness.” 
“And the very last person he want
ed alerted to his return the mo-
"ment he got back was Dumbledore,” said Lupin. “And you made sure "
Dumbledore knew at once.” 
“How has that help
ed?” Harry asked. 
“Are you kidding?” said Bill incr
edulously. “Dumbledore was the 
only one You-Know-Who was ever scared of!” 
"“Thanks to you, Dumbledore was ab"
le to recall the Order of the 
Phoenix about an hour after Vold
"emort returned,” said Sirius. "
“So what’s the Order b
"een doing?” said Harry,"
 looking around at 
them all. 
“Working as hard as we can to 
make sure Voldemort can’t carry out 
"his plans,” said Sirius. "
“How d’you know what his plans are?” Harry asked quickly. 
"“Dumbledore’s got a shrewd idea,”"
" said Lupin, “and Dumbledore’s "
shrewd ideas normally turn
 out to be accurate.” 
“So what does Dumbledore 
reckon he’s planning?” 
"“Well, firstly, he wants to build up"
" his army again,” said Sirius. “In "
  93 the old days he had huge numbers 
at his command; witches and wiz-
ards he’d bullied or bewitched into
" following him, his faithful Death "
"Eaters, a great variety of Dark crea"
tures. You heard him planning to 
"recruit the giants; well, they’ll be just one group he’s after. He’s cer-"
tainly not going to try and take on 
the Ministry of Magic with only a 
dozen Death Eaters.” 
“So you’re trying to stop 
him getting more followers?” 
"“We’re doing our best,” said Lupin. "
“How?” 
"“Well, the main thing is to try an"
d convince as many people as pos-
sible that You-Know-Who really ha
"s returned, to put them on their "
"guard,” said Bill. “It’s "
"proving tricky, though.” "
“Why?” 
"“Because of the Ministry’s attitude,” said Tonks. “You saw Cor-"
nelius Fudge after You-Know-Who ca
"me back, Harry. Well, he hasn’t "
shifted his position at all. He’s absolutely refusing to believe it’s 
happened.” 
“But why?” said Harry desperately. “Why’s he being so stupid? If 
Dumbledore —” 
"“Ah, well, you’ve put your finger "
"on the problem,” said Mr. Weasley "
with a wry smile. “
Dumbledore.
” 
"“Fudge is frightened of him, you see,” said Tonks sadly. "
“Frightened of Dumbledore?” 
said Harry incredulously. 
"“Frightened of what he’s up to,” "
"said Mr. Weasley. “You see, Fudge "
thinks Dumbledore’s plotting to overthrow him. He thinks Dumble-
dore wants to be Mi
nister of Magic.” 
“But Dumbledore 
doesn’t want —” 
"“Of course he doesn’t,” said Mr. "
Weasley. “He’s never wanted the 
"Minister’s job, even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when "
Millicent Bagnold retired. Fudge ca
"me to power instead, but he’s "
never quite forgotten how much 
"popular support Dumbledore had, "
even though Dumbledore ne
ver applied for the job.” 
 94 "“Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore’s much cleverer than he is, "
"a much more powerful wizard, and in"
 the early days of his Ministry he 
was forever asking Dumbledore for help
" and advice,” said Lupin. “But "
"it seems that he’s become fond of power now, and much more confi-"
"dent. He loves being Minister of Magic, and he’s managed to convince "
himself that he’s the cl
ever one and Dumbledore’s
 simply stirring up 
trouble for the sake of it.” 
“How can he think that?” said 
Harry angrily. “How can he think 
Dumbledore would just ma
ke it all up — that 
I’d
 make it all up?” 
“Because accepting that Voldemort’
s back would mean trouble like 
the Ministry hasn’t had to cope with
" for nearly fourteen years,” said "
Sirius bitterly. “Fudge just can’t bring himself to face it. It’s so much 
more comfortable to convince hims
elf Dumbledore’s lying to destabi-
lize him.” 
"“You see the problem,” said Lupin. “While the Ministry insists "
there is nothing to fear 
"from Voldemort, it’s hard to convince people "
"he’s back, especially as they really "
don’t want to believe it in the first 
"place. What’s more, the Minist"
ry’s leaning heavily on the 
Daily 
Prophet
 not to report any of what they’re calling Dumbledore’s rumor-
"mongering, so most of the Wizarding community are completely un-"
"aware anything’s happened, and that"
 makes them easy targets for the 
Death Eaters if they’re us
ing the Imperius Curse.” 
"“But you’re telling people, aren’t "
"you?” said Harry, looking around "
"at Mr. Weasley, Sirius, Bill, Mundungus, Lupin, and Tonks. “You’re "
letting people know he’s back?” 
They all smiled humorlessly. 
"“Well, as everyone thinks I’m "
a mad mass murderer and the Min-
"istry’s put a ten-thousand-Galleon price on my head, I can hardly stroll "
"up the street and start handing out leaflets, can I?” said Sirius restlessly. "
“And I’m not a very popular dinner guest with most of the commu-
"nity,” said Lupin. “It’s an occupati"
onal hazard of being a werewolf.” 
  95 “Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they 
"started shooting their mouths off,” said"
" Sirius, “and it’s very important "
for us to have spies inside the 
"Ministry, because "
you can bet Volde-
mort will have them.” 
“We’ve managed to convince a coup
"le of people, though,” said Mr. "
"Weasley. “Tonks here, for one — she’s too young to have been in the "
Order of the Phoenix last
" time, and having Aurors on our side is a "
huge advantage — Kingsley Shacklebolt’s been a real asset too. He’s in 
"charge of the hunt for Sirius, so "
he’s been feeding the Ministry infor-
mation that Sirius is in Tibet.” 
“But if none of you’s putting the news out that Voldemort’s 
back —” Harry began. 
“Who said none of us 
was putting the news out?” said Sirius. “Why 
d’you think Dumbledore’s
 in such trouble?” 
“What d’you mean?”
 Harry asked. 
"“They’re trying to discredit him,”"
 said Lupin. “Didn’t you see the 
Daily Prophet
 last week? They reported that he’d been voted out of the 
Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because 
"he’s getting old and losing his grip, but it’s not true, he was voted out "
by Ministry wizards after he made
 a speech announcing Voldemort’s 
return. They’ve demoted him from
 Chief Warlock on the Wizen-
gamot — that’s the Wizard High 
Court — and they’re talking about 
taking away his Order of 
"Merlin, First Class, too.” "
“But Dumbledore says he doesn’t care
 what they do as long as they 
"don’t take him off the Chocolate Frog cards,” said Bill, grinning. "
"“It’s no laughing matter,” said Mr. "
Weasley shortly. “If he carries on 
"defying the Ministry like this, he"
 could end up in Azkaban and the 
last thing we want is Dumbledor
e locked up. While You-Know-Who 
knows Dumbledore’s out there and wise 
"to what he’s up to, he’s going "
to go cautiously for a while. If 
"Dumbledore’s out of the way — well, "
You-Know-Who will have a clear field.” 
 96 "“But if Voldemort’s trying to recruit more Death Eaters, it’s bound "
"to get out that he’s come back, is"
n’t it?” asked Ha
rry desperately. 
“Voldemort doesn’t march up to pe
ople’s houses and bang on their 
"front doors, Harry,” said Sirius. “H"
"e tricks, jinxes, and blackmails "
"them. He’s well-practiced at operating in secrecy. In any case, gather-"
"ing followers is only one thing he’s interested in, he’s got other plans "
"too, plans he can put into operatio"
"n very quietly indeed, and he’s con-"
centrating on them at the moment.” 
“What’s he after apart from followers?” Harry asked swiftly. 
He thought he saw Sirius and Lupi
n exchange the most fleeting of 
"looks before Sirius said, “Stuff"
 he can only get by stealth.” 
When Harry continued to look pu
"zzled, Sirius said, “Like a "
weapon. Something he didn’t have last time.” 
“When he was powerful before?” 
“Yes.” 
“Like what kind of weapon?” sa
id Harry. “Something worse than 
the 
Avada Kedavra
 — ?” 
“That’s enough.” 
Mrs. Weasley spoke from the sh
adows beside the door. Harry had 
not noticed her return from taking Ginny upstairs. Her arms were 
crossed and she looked furious. 
"“I want you in bed, now. All of "
"you,” she added, looking around at "
"Fred, George, Ron, and Hermione. "
“You can’t boss us —” Fred began. 
"“Watch me,” snarled Mrs. Weasley."
 She was trembling slightly as 
she looked at Sirius. “You’ve give
n Harry plenty of information. Any 
more and you might just as well induct him into the Order 
straightaway.” 
“Why not?” said Harry quickly. “I’ll 
"join, I want to join, I want to "
fight —” 
“No.” 
"It was not Mrs. Weasley who spoke this time, but Lupin. "
  97 “The Order is comprised only of 
"overage wizards,” he said. “Wiz-"
"ards who have left school,” he adde"
"d, as Fred and George opened their "
mouths. “There are dangers involved
" of which you can have no idea, "
any of you . . . I think Molly’s ri
"ght, Sirius. We’ve said enough.” "
Sirius half-shrugged but did not argue. Mrs. Weasley beckoned im-
periously to her sons and Hermio
ne. One by one they stood up and 
"Harry, recognizing d"
"efeat, followed suit. "
rs. Weasley followed them
 upstairs looking grim. 
“I want you all to go straig
"ht to bed, no talking,” she "
said as they reached the first landin
g. “We’ve got a busy day tomorrow. 
"I expect Ginny’s asleep,”"
" she added to Hermione, “so try not to wake "
her up.” 
"“Asleep, yeah, right,” said Fred in an undertone, after Hermione "
bade them good night and they were
 climbing to the next floor. “If 
Ginny’s not lying awake waiting for 
Hermione to tell
 her everything 
"they said downstairs, then "
I’m a flobberworm. . . .” 
"“All right, Ron, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley on the second landing, "
pointing them into their bedroom. “Off to bed with you.” 
"“’Night,” Harry and Ron said to the twins. "
"“Sleep tight,” said Fred, winking. "
Mrs. Weasley closed the door behi
nd Harry with a sharp snap. The 
"bedroom looked, if anything, even "
danker and gloomier than it had 
on first sight. The blank picture on
 the wall was now breathing very 
"slowly and deeply, as though its in"
visible occupant was asleep. Harry 
"put on his pajamas, took off his glasses, and climbed into his chilly "
M
   99 bed while Ron threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify 
"Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were "
clattering around and rustling 
their wings restlessly. 
“We can’t let them out to hunt ev
"ery night,” Ron explained as he "
pulled on his maroon pajamas. “D
umbledore doesn’t want too many 
"owls swooping around the square, thinks it’ll look suspicious. Oh "
yeah . . . I forgot. . . .” 
He crossed to the door and bolted it. 
“What’re you doing that for?” 
"“Kreacher,” said Ron as he turned "
off the light. “First night I was 
here he came wandering in at th
"ree in the morning. Trust me, you "
don’t want to wake up and find him prowling around your room. 
"Anyway . . .” He got into his bed,"
" settled down under the covers, then "
turned to look at Har
ry in the darkness. Har
ry could see his outline 
by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window. “
What d’you 
reckon
?” 
Harry didn’t need to 
ask what Ron meant. 
"“Well, they didn’t tell us much we couldn’t have guessed, did they?” "
"he said, thinking of all that had "
"been said downstairs. “I mean, all "
they’ve really said is 
that the Order’s trying 
to stop people joining 
Vol —” 
There was a sharp intake 
of breath from Ron. 
“— 
"demort,"
” said Harry firmly. “When are you going to start using 
his name? Sirius and Lupin do.” 
Ron ignored this last comment. “Yea
"h, you’re right,” he said. “We "
already knew nearly everything they
" told us, from "
using the Extend-
able Ears. The only new bit was —” 
Crack.
“OUCH!” 
"“Keep your voice down, Ron, or Mum’ll be back up here.” "
“You two just
 Apparated on
 my knees!” 
"“Yeah, well, it’s harder in the dark —” "
 100 Harry saw the blurred outlines of 
Fred and George leaping down 
from Ron’s bed. There was a groan 
of bedsprings an
d Harry’s mattress 
descended a few inches as Ge
orge sat down near his feet. 
"“So, got there yet?” sa"
id George eagerly. 
“The weapon Sirius mentioned?” said Harry. 
"“Let slip, more like,” said Fred wi"
"th relish, now sitting next to Ron. "
“We didn’t hear about 
that
 on the old Extend
"ables, did we?” "
“What d’you reckon it
 is?” said Harry. 
"“Could be anything,” said Fred. "
“But there can’t be an
ything worse than the 
Avada Kedavra
" curse, "
can there?” said Ron. “W
hat’s worse than death?” 
“Maybe it’s something that can ki
"ll loads of people at once,” sug-"
gested George. 
"“Maybe it’s some particularly painful way of killing people,” said "
Ron fearfully. 
“He’s got the Cruciatus Curse for 
"causing pain,” said Harry. “He "
doesn’t need anything more
 efficient than that.” 
"There was a pause and Harry knew that the others, like him, were "
wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate. 
“So who d’you thinks got 
it now?” asked George. 
"“I hope it’s our side,” said Ro"
"n, sounding slightly nervous. "
"“If it is, Dumbledore’s probably keeping it,” said Fred. "
“Where?” said Ron qu
ickly. “Hogwarts?” 
“Bet it is!” said George. “That’s 
where he hid the Sorcerer’s Stone!” 
"“A weapon’s going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, though!” said "
Ron. 
"“Not necessarily,” said Fred. "
"“Yeah, size is no guarantee of"
" power,” said George. “Look at "
Ginny.” 
“What d’you mean?”
 said Harry. 
“You’ve never been on the receivin
g end of one of her Bat-Bogey 
"Hexes, have you?” "
   101 "“Shhh!” said Fred, half-risin"
g from the bed. “Listen!” 
They fell silent. Footsteps were
 coming up the stairs again. 
"“Mum,” said George, and without further ado there was a loud "
crack and Harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed. A few 
seconds later and they heard the 
floorboard creak outside their door; 
Mrs. Weasley was plainly listening to
 see whether they were talking or 
not. 
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted 
dolefully. The floorboard creaked 
again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and 
George. 
"“She doesn’t trust us at all, yo"
"u know,” said Ron regretfully. "
Harry was sure he would not be able
 to fall asleep; the evening had 
been so packed with things to think 
about that he fully expected to lie 
awake for hours mulling it all over. 
He wanted to cont
inue talking to 
"Ron, but Mrs. Weasley was now crea"
"king back downstairs again, and "
once she had gone he distinctly he
ard others making their way up-
"stairs. . . . In fact, ma"
ny-legged creatures were cantering softly up and 
"down outside the bedroom door, and "
"Hagrid, the Care of Magical "
"Creatures teacher, was saying, “"
"Beauties, aren’ they, eh, Harry? We’ll be "
studyin’ weapons this term.
 . . .” And Harry saw that the creatures had 
cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him. . . . He ducked. . . . 
"The next thing he knew, he was cu"
rled in a warm ball under his 
"bedclothes, and George’s loud"
 voice was filling the room. 
"“Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs "
"you in the drawing room, there are "
loads more doxies than she thought 
and she’s found a nest of dead
 puffskeins under the sofa.” 
"Half an hour later, Harry and "
"Ron, who had dressed and break-"
"fasted quickly, entered the drawin"
"g room, a long, high-ceilinged room "
on the first floor with olive-green wa
lls covered in dirty tapestries. The 
carpet exhaled little clouds of dust
 every time someone put their foot 
"on it and the long, moss-green velvet"
 curtains were buzzing as though 
swarming with invisible bees. It wa
"s around these that Mrs. Weasley, "
 102 "Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and George we"
"re grouped, all looking rather "
"peculiar, as they had tied cloths ov"
er their noses and mouths. Each of 
them was also holding a large bottle 
of black liquid with a nozzle at 
the end. 
“Cover your faces and take a spra
"y,” Mrs. Weasley said to Harry "
"and Ron the moment she saw them, pointing to two more bottles of "
black liquid standing on a spindle-
legged table. “It’s Doxycide. I’ve 
never seen an infestation this bad — 
what
 that house-elf’s been doing 
for the last ten years —” 
Hermione’s face was 
half concealed by a tea towel but Harry dis-
tinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at Mrs. Weasley at these 
words. 
"“Kreacher’s really old, he probably couldn’t manage —” "
“You’d be surprised what Kreacher
" can manage when he wants to, "
"Hermione,” said Sirius, who had "
just entered the room carrying a 
bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats. “I’ve just been feed-
"ing Buckbeak,” he added, in reply to Harry’s inquiring look. “I keep him "
upstairs in my mother’s bedroom. Anyw
ay . . . this writing desk . . .” 
He dropped the bag of rats onto an
" armchair, then bent over to ex-"
"amine the locked cabinet which, Ha"
"rry now noticed for the first time, "
was shaking slightly. 
"“Well, Molly, I’m pretty sure this "
"is a boggart,” said Sirius, peering "
"through the keyhole, “but perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a "
shifty at it before we let it out — knowing my mother it could be 
something much worse.” 
"“Right you are, Sirius,” said Mrs. Weasley. "
They were both speaking in carefully
" light, polite voices that told "
Harry quite plainly that
 neither had forgotten 
their disagreement of 
the night before. 
"A loud, clanging bell so"
"unded from downstairs, followed at once by "
the cacophony of screams and wails 
that had been triggered the previ-
ous night by Tonks knocking 
over the umbrella stand. 
   103 “I keep telling them not to ring 
the doorbell!” said Sirius exasperat-
"edly, hurrying back out of the room. They heard him thundering "
down the stairs as Mrs. Black’s scre
eches echoed up through the house 
once more: “
"Stains of dishonor, filthy half-breeds, blood traitors, children "
of filth
 . . .” 
"“Close the door, please, Har"
"ry,” said Mrs. Weasley. "
Harry took as much time
 as he dared to close the drawing room 
door; he wanted to listen to what 
was going on downstairs. Sirius had 
obviously managed to shut
 the curtains over his mother’s portrait be-
cause she had stopped screaming. 
He heard Sirius walking down the 
"hall, then the clattering of the "
"chain on the front door, and then a "
deep voice he recognized as Kingsl
"ey Shacklebolt’s saying, “Hestia’s "
"just relieved me, so she’s got Moody’"
"s cloak now, thought I’d leave a re-"
port for Dumbledore. . . .” 
"Feeling Mrs. Weasley’s eyes on the back of his head, Harry regret-"
fully closed the draw
ing room door and rejo
ined the doxy party. 
Mrs. Weasley was bending over to check the page on doxies in 
"Gilderoy Lockhart’s Guide to Household Pests,"
 which was lying open on 
the sofa. 
"“Right, you lot, you need to be "
"careful, because doxies bite and "
"their teeth are poisonous. I’ve got a bottle of antidote here, but I’d "
rather nobody needed it.” 
"She straightened up, positioned hers"
elf squarely in front of the cur-
"tains, and beckoned them all forward. "
"“When I say the word, start spraying immediately,” she said. "
"“They’ll come flying out at us, I expe"
"ct, but it says on the sprays one "
good squirt will paralyze them. When 
"they’re immobilized, just throw "
them in this bucket.” 
She stepped carefully out of their line of fire and raised her own 
spray. “All right — 
squirt
!” 
Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fully grown 
"doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material, shiny beetlelike wings "
 104 "whirring, tiny needle-sharp teeth "
"bared, its fairyl"
ike body covered 
with thick black hair and its four ti
ny fists clenched with fury. Harry 
caught it full in the face with a bl
ast of Doxycide; it froze in midair 
"and fell, with a surprisingly loud "
thunk
", onto the worn carpet below. "
Harry picked it up and 
threw it in the bucket. 
"“Fred, what are you doing?” said Mr"
s. Weasley sharply. “Spray that 
at once and th
row it away!” 
Harry looked around. Fred was holding a struggling doxy between 
his forefinger and thumb. 
"“Right-o,” Fred said br"
"ightly, spraying the dox"
y quickly in the face 
"so that it fainted, but the moment "
Mrs. Weasley’s back was turned he 
pocketed it with a wink. 
“We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snack-
"boxes,” George told Ha"
rry under his breath. 
Deftly spraying two doxies at once as they soared straight for his 
"nose, Harry moved closer to George"
 and muttered out of the corner 
"of his mouth, “What ar"
e Skiving Snackboxes?” 
“Range of sweets to make you i
"ll,” George whispered, keeping a "
wary eye on Mrs. Weasley’s back. “N
"ot seriously ill, mind, just ill "
enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. Fred and I have 
"been developing them this summer. They’re double-ended, color-"
coded chews. If you eat the orange 
"half of the Puking Pastilles, you "
throw up. Moment you’ve been rush
ed out of the lesson for the hos-
"pital wing, you swallow the purple half —” "
“‘— which restores you to full fit
"ness, enabling you to pursue the "
leisure activity of your own choice
 during an hour that would other-
wise have been devoted to unprofit
able boredom.’ That’s what we’re 
"putting in the adverts, anyway,” whispered Fred, who had edged over "
out of Mrs. Weasley’s line of visi
on and was now sweeping a few stray 
doxies from the floor and adding them
 to his pocket. “But they still 
need a bit of work. At th
e moment our testers are having a bit of trou-
ble stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple end.” 
   105 “Testers?” 
"“Us,” said Fred. “We take it in tu"
rns. George did the Fainting Fan-
cies — we both tried th
e Nosebleed Nougat —” 
“Mum thought we’d
" been dueling,” said George. "
"“Joke shop still on, then?” Harry "
"muttered, pretending to be ad-"
justing the nozzle on his spray. 
"“Well, we haven’t had a chance to"
" get premises yet,” said Fred, "
dropping his voice even lower as 
Mrs. Weasley mopped her brow with 
her scarf before returning to the atta
"ck, “so we’re running it as a mail-"
order service at the moment. We
 put advertisements in the 
Daily 
Prophet
 last week.” 
"“All thanks to you, mate,” said"
 George. “But don’t worry . . . Mum 
hasn’t got a clue. She won’t read the 
Daily Prophet
" anymore, ’cause of "
it telling lies about 
you and Dumbledore.” 
Harry grinned. He had forced the 
Weasley twins to take the thou-
sand-Galleon prize money he had 
won in the Triwizard Tournament 
to help them realize their ambition
" to open a joke shop, but he was "
still glad to know that his part in
 furthering their plans was unknown 
"to Mrs. Weasley, who did not thin"
k that running a joke shop was a 
suitable career for two of her sons. 
The de-doxying of the curtains to
ok most of the morning. It was 
"past midday when Mrs. Weasley finally removed her protective scarf, "
"sank into a sagging armchair, and sp"
rang up again with a cry of dis-
"gust, having sat on the bag of dead rats. The curtains were no longer "
buzzing; they hung limp and damp
 from the intensive spraying; un-
conscious doxies lay crammed in the bu
cket at the foot of them beside 
"a bowl of their black eggs, at wh"
ich Crookshanks was now sniffing 
and Fred and George
 were shooting covetous looks. 
“I think we’ll tackle 
those
 after lunch.” 
Mrs. Weasley pointed at the dusty 
glass-fronted cabinets standing 
on either side of the mantelpiece.
 They were crammed with an odd 
assortment of objects: a selection 
"of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled "
 106 "snakeskin, a number of tarnished si"
lver boxes inscribed with languages 
Harry could not understand
" and, least pleasant of"
" all, an ornate crys-"
tal bottle with a large opal set into
" the stopper, full of what Harry was "
quite sure was blood. 
The clanging doorbell rang again. Everyone looked at Mrs. Weasley. 
"“Stay here,” she said firmly, snatc"
hing up the bag of rats as Mrs. 
Blacks screeches started up again from down below. “I’ll bring up 
some sandwiches.” 
"She left the room, closing the door "
"carefully behind her. At once, "
everyone dashed over to the window to look down onto the doorstep. 
They could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of pre-
cariously balanced cauldrons. 
“Mundungus!” said Hermione. “Wha
t’s he brought all those caul-
drons for?” 
“Probably looking for a safe place to
" keep them,” said Harry. “Isn’t "
that what he was doing the night he
 was supposed to be tailing me? 
Picking up dodgy cauldrons?” 
"“Yeah, you’re right!” said Fred"
", as the front door opened; Mundun-"
gus heaved his cauldrons through 
it and disappeared from view. 
"“Blimey, Mum won’t "
like that. . . .” 
He and George crossed to the door
 and stood beside
" it, listening "
intently. Mrs. Black’s scre
aming had stopped again. 
“Mundungus is talking to Sirius
" and Kingsley,” Fred muttered, "
frowning with concentration. “Can’t hear properly . . . d’you reckon 
we can risk the Extendable Ears?” 
"“Might be worth it,” said George. "
“I could sneak upstairs and get a 
pair —” 
But at that precise moment there 
was an explosion of sound from 
downstairs that rendered Extendable
 Ears quite unnecessary. All of 
them could hear exactly what Mrs. 
Weasley was shouting at the top of 
her voice. 
   107 “WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN 
GOODS!” 
"“I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,” said Fred, with a "
satisfied smile on his face as he ope
ned the door an inch or so to allow 
Mrs. Weasley’s voice to permeate 
the room better. “It makes such a 
nice change.” 
“— COMPLETELY IRRESPONSI
"BLE, AS IF WE HAVEN’T "
GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY AB
OUT WITHOUT YOU DRAG-
GING STOLEN CAULDRON
S INTO THE HOUSE —” 
“The idiots are letting her get into
" her stride,” said George, shaking "
his head. “You’ve got to head her o
"ff early, otherwise she builds up a "
head of steam and goes on for hour
s. And she’s been 
dying to have a 
go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to 
"be following you, Harry — and th"
ere goes Sirius’s mum again —” 
Mrs. Weasley’s voice was lost amid
 fresh shrieks and screams from 
the portraits in the hall. George made to shut the door to drown the 
"noise, but before he could do so"
", a house-elf edged into the room. "
Except for the filthy rag tied like
" a loincloth around its middle, it "
was completely naked. It looked very 
old. Its skin seemed to be several 
times too big for it and though it wa
"s bald like all house-elves, there "
"was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its "
"eyes were a bloodshot and watery gray, and its fleshy nose was large "
and rather snoutlike. 
The elf took absolutely no notice 
of Harry and the rest. Acting as 
"though it could not see them, it "
"shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and "
"doggedly, toward the far end of th"
"e room, muttering under its breath "
"all the while in a hoarse, deep voice li"
"ke a bullfrog’s, “. . . Smells like "
"a drain and a criminal to boot, bu"
"t she’s no better, nasty old blood "
"traitor with her brats messing up my Mistress’s house, oh my poor "
"Mistress, if she knew, if she knew "
"the scum they’ve let in her house, "
what would she say to old Kreacher
", oh the shame of it, Mudbloods  "
 108 and werewolves and traitors and thie
"ves, poor old Kr"
"eacher, what can "
he do. . . .” 
"“Hello, Kreacher,” said Fred ve"
"ry loudly, closing the door with a "
snap. 
"The house-elf froze in his tracks, "
"stopped muttering, and then gave "
a very pronounced and very unco
nvincing start of surprise. 
"“Kreacher did not see Young Master,” he said, turning around and "
bowing to Fred. Still facing the ca
"rpet, he added, perfectly audibly, "
“Nasty little brat of 
a blood traitor it is.” 
“Sorry?” said George. “Did
n’t catch that last bit.” 
"“Kreacher said nothing,” "
"said the elf, with a "
"second bow to George, "
"adding in a clear undertone, “and "
"there’s its twin, unnatural little "
beasts they are.” 
Harry didn’t know whether to laug
h or not. The elf straightened 
"up, eyeing them all very malevolen"
"tly, and apparently convinced that "
they could not hear him as
 he continued to mutter. 
"“. . . and there’s the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if "
"my Mistress knew, oh how she’d cry, and there’s a new boy, Kreacher "
"doesn’t know his name, what is "
"he doing here, Kr"
eacher doesn’t 
know . . .” 
"“This is Harry, Kreacher,” said "
Hermione tentatively. “Harry 
Potter.” 
Kreacher’s pale eyes widened and he
 muttered faster and more furi-
ously than ever. 
“The Mudblood is talking to Kreach
"er as though she is my friend, "
if Kreacher’s Mistress saw him in 
"such company, oh what would she "
say —” 
“Don’t call her a Mudblood!” said
" Ron and Ginny together, very "
angrily. 
"“It doesn’t matter,” Hermione w"
"hispered, “he’s not in his right "
"mind, he doesn’t kn"
ow what he’s —” 
   109 "“Don’t kid yourself, Hermione, he knows "
exactly
" what he’s saying,” "
"said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike. "
Kreacher was still mutteri
"ng, his eyes on Harry. "
“Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Krea
"cher can see the scar, it must be "
"true, that’s that boy who stopped "
"the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders "
how he did it —” 
"“Don’t we all, Kreacher?” said Fred. "
“What do you want anyway?” George asked. 
Kreacher’s huge eyes darted onto George. 
"“Kreacher is cleaning,”"
 he said evasively. 
"“A likely story,” said a voice behind Harry. "
Sirius had come back; he was gl
owering at the elf from the door-
way. The noise in the hall had 
abated; perhaps Mrs. Weasley and 
Mundungus had moved their argument
 down into the kitchen. At the 
"sight of Sirius, Kreacher flung himsel"
f into a ridiculously low bow that 
flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor. 
"“Stand up straight,” said Sirius "
"impatiently. “Now, "
what are you up 
to?” 
"“Kreacher is cleaning,” the elf repe"
ated. “Kreacher lives to serve the 
noble house of Black —” 
“— and it’s getting bl
"acker every day, it’s "
"filthy,” said Sirius. "
“Master always liked his little joke
",” said Kreacher, bowing again, "
"and continuing in an undertone, "
“Master was a nasty ungrateful swine 
who broke his mother’s heart —” 
“My mother didn’t have
" a heart, Kreacher,” Sirius snapped. “She "
kept herself alive out of pure spite.” 
"Kreacher bowed again and said, “Whatever Master says,” then "
"muttered furiously, “Master is not fi"
t to wipe slime from his mother’s 
"boots, oh my poor Mist"
"ress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher "
"serving him, how she hated him, what a disappointment he was —” "
"“I asked you what you were up to,” said Sirius coldly. “Every time  "
 110 you show up pretending to be clea
"ning, you sneak something off to "
your room so we ca
n’t throw it out.” 
“Kreacher would never move anythi
ng from its proper place in 
"Master’s house,” said the elf, then"
" muttered very fast, “Mistress would "
"never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries "
"it’s been in the family, Kreacher mu"
"st save it, Kreacher will not let "
Master and the blood traitors 
and the brats destroy it —” 
"“I thought it might be that,” said "
"Sirius, casting a disdainful look at "
the opposite wall. “She’ll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm 
"on the back of it, I don’t doubt, but if"
 I can get rid of it I certainly will. 
"Now go away, Kreacher.” "
It seemed that Kreacher did not da
re disobey a direct order; never-
"theless, the look he gave Sirius as "
he shuffled out past him was redolent 
of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room. 
“— comes back from Azkaban orde
"ring Kreacher around, oh my "
"poor Mistress, what would she say if"
" she saw the house now, scum liv-"
"ing in it, her treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers "
"and he’s back, they say he’s a murderer too —” "
“Keep muttering and I will be a murder
"er!” said Sirius irritably, and "
he slammed the door shut on the elf. 
"“Sirius, he’s not right in the he"
"ad,” said Hermione pleadingly, “I "
don’t think he realizes
 we can hear him.” 
"“He’s been alone too long,” said "
"Sirius, “taking mad orders from "
"my mother’s portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul "
little —” 
"“If you just set him free,” said"
" Hermione hopefully, “maybe —” "
"“We can’t set him free, he knows "
"too much about the Order,” said "
"Sirius curtly. “And anyway, the shoc"
k would kill him. You suggest to 
him that he leaves this ho
"use, see how he takes it.” "
"Sirius walked across the room, "
where the tapestry Kreacher had 
been trying to protect hung the le
ngth of the wall. Harry and the oth-
ers followed. 
   111 The tapestry looked immensely ol
d; it was faded and looked as 
though doxies had gnawed it in plac
"es; nevertheless, the golden thread "
with which it was embroidered still 
glinted brightly enough to show 
them a sprawling family tree dating 
back (as far as Ha
rry could tell) to 
the Middle Ages. Large words at th
e very top of the tapestry read: 
The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black 
“Toujours Pur” 
"“You’re not on here!” said Harry, "
after scanning the bottom of the 
tree. 
"“I used to be there,” said Sirius, "
"pointing at a small, round, charred "
"hole in the tapestry, rather like a "
cigarette burn. “My 
sweet old mother 
blasted me off after I ran away from
 home — Kreacher’s quite fond of 
muttering the story 
under his breath.” 
“You ran away from home?” 
“When I was about sixt
"een,” said Sirius. "
“I’d had enough.” 
“Where did you go?” aske
"d Harry, staring at him. "
"“Your dad’s place,” said Sirius. “Your grandparents were really good "
about it; they sort of adopted me as
" a second son. Yeah, I camped out "
at your dad’s during the school 
"holidays, and then when I was seven-"
"teen I got a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me a decent "
"bit of gold — he’s been wiped off here too, that’s probably why — "
"anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr. "
"and Mrs. Potter’s for Sunday lunch, though.” "
“But . . . why did you . . . ?” 
“Leave?” Sirius smiled bitterly an
"d ran a hand through his long, un-"
"kempt hair. “Because I hated the whole lot of them: my parents, with "
"their pure-blood mania, "
convinced that to be 
a Black made you prac-
"tically royal . . . my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them . . . "
that’s him.” 
Sirius jabbed a finger
 at the very bottom of 
"the tree, at the name "
 112 regulus black
. A date of death (some fifteen years previously) fol-
lowed the date of birth. 
"“He was younger than me,” said Siri"
"us, “and a much better son, as "
I was constantly reminded.” 
"“But he died,” said Harry. "
"“Yeah,” said Sirius. “Stupid idiot . "
. . he joined the Death Eaters.” 
“You’re kidding!” 
"“Come on, Harry, haven’t you seen "
enough of this house to tell 
what kind of wizards my family were?” said Sirius testily. 
“Were — were your parent
s Death Eaters as well?” 
"“No, no, but believe me, they "
thought Voldemort had the right 
"idea, they were all for the purification of the Wizarding race, getting "
rid of Muggle-borns and having pu
rebloods in charge. They weren’t 
"alone either, there were quite a fe"
"w people, before Voldemort showed "
"his true colors, who thought he had "
the right idea about things. . . . 
They got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get 
"power, though. But I bet my parent"
s thought Regulus was a right lit-
tle hero for joining up at first.” 
“Was he killed by an Auro
r?” Harry asked tentatively. 
"“Oh no,” said Sirius. “No, he wa"
s murdered by Voldemort. Or on 
"Voldemort’s orders, more likely, I doubt Regulus was ever important "
enough to be killed by Voldemort in
 person. From what I found out 
"after he died, he got in so far, th"
en panicked about what he was being 
"asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you don’t just hand in your "
resignation to Voldemort. It’s 
a lifetime of service or death.” 
"“Lunch,” said Mrs. Weasley’s voice. "
She was holding her wand high in 
"front of her, balancing a huge "
tray loaded with sandwiches and ca
ke on its tip. She was very red in 
"the face and still looked angry. The others moved over to her, eager for "
"some food, but Harry remained with"
" Sirius, who had "
bent closer to 
the tapestry. 
   113 “I haven’t looked at this for year
s. There’s Phineas Nigellus . . . my 
"great-great-grandfather, see? Least "
popular headmaster Hogwarts ever 
had . . . and Araminta Meliflua . . . co
usin of my mother’s . . . tried to 
force through a Ministry Bill to ma
ke Muggle-hunting legal . . . and 
dear Aunt Elladora . . . she started 
the family tradition of beheading 
"house-elves when they got too old to carry tea trays . . . of course, "
anytime the family produced someo
ne halfway decent they were dis-
owned. I see Tonks isn’t on here. 
Maybe that’s why Kreacher won’t 
take orders from her — he’s supposed to do whatever anyone in the 
family asks him. . . .” 
“You and Tonks are related?
"” Harry asked, surprised. "
"“Oh yeah, her mother, Andromeda, was my favorite cousin,” said "
"Sirius, examining the tapestry carefu"
"lly. “No, Andromeda’s not on here "
"either, look —” "
He pointed to another small roun
"d burn mark between two names, "
Bellatrix and Narcissa. 
“Andromeda’s sisters are still here
" because they made lovely, re-"
"spectable pure-blood marriages, bu"
t Andromeda married a Muggle-
"born, Ted Tonks, so —” "
Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry 
with a wand and laughed sourly. 
"Harry, however, did not laugh; he "
was too busy staring at the names 
to the right of Andromeda’s bu
rn mark. A double line of gold 
embroidery linked Narcissa Black wi
"th Lucius Malfoy, and a single "
vertical gold line from their 
names led to the name Draco. 
“You’re related to the Malfoys!” 
“The pure-blood families are all inte
"rrelated,” said Sirius. “If you’re "
only going to let your sons an
d daughters marry purebloods your 
"choice is very limited, there are hard"
ly any of us left. Molly and I are 
cousins by marriage and Arthur’s so
mething like my second cousin 
once removed. But there’s no point looking for them on here — if 
ever a family was a bu
nch of blood traitors 
it’s the Weasleys.” 
 114 But Harry was now looking 
at the name to the 
left of Andromeda’s 
"burn: Bellatrix Black, "
which was connected by a double line to Rodol-
phus Lestrange. 
“Lestrange . . .” Harry said aloud.
 The name had stirred something 
in his memory; he knew it from 
"somewhere, but for a moment he "
"couldn’t think where, though it "
"gave him an odd, creeping sensation "
in the pit of his stomach. 
"“They’re in Azkaban,” "
said Sirius shortly. 
Harry looked at him curiously. 
“Bellatrix and her husband Rodolph
"us came in with Barty Crouch, "
"Junior,” said Sirius in the same "
"brusque voice. “Rodolphus’s brother, "
"Rabastan, was with them too.” "
And Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside 
"Dumbledore’s Pensieve, the strange "
device in which thoughts and 
memories could be stored: a tall 
dark woman with 
"heavy-lidded eyes, "
who had stood at her trial and procla
imed her continuing allegiance to 
"Lord Voldemort, her pride that sh"
e had tried to find him after his 
downfall and her conviction that sh
e would one day be rewarded for 
her loyalty. 
“You never said she was your —” 
“Does it matter if she’s my cousin?” snapped Sirius. “As far as I’m 
"concerned, they’re not my family. "
She’s
 certainly not my family. I 
haven’t seen her since I was your ag
"e, unless you count a glimpse of her "
coming in to Azkaban. 
D’you think I’m proud of having relatives like 
her?” 
"“Sorry,” said Harry quickly, “I didn"
’t mean — I was 
"just surprised, "
that’s all —” 
"“It doesn’t matter, don’t apologiz"
"e,” Sirius mumbled at once. He "
"turned away from the tapestry, his ha"
nds deep in his pockets. “I don’t 
"like being back here,” he said, st"
aring across the drawing room. “I 
never thought I’d be stuc
k in this house again.” 
Harry understood completely. He knew how he would feel if 
   115 "forced, when he was grown up and "
thought he was free of the place 
"forever, to return and live at"
" number four, Privet Drive. "
"“It’s ideal for headquarters, of cour"
"se,” Sirius said. “My father put "
every security measure known to 
Wizard-kind on it when he lived 
"here. It’s Unplottable, so Muggles "
could never come and call — as if 
they’d have wanted to — and no
w Dumbledore’s added his protec-
"tion, you’d be hard put to find a safer house anywhere. Dumbledore’s "
"Secret-Keeper for the Order, you know — nobody can find headquar-"
ters unless he tells them personally
 where it is — that note Moody 
"showed you last night, that was from"
 Dumbledore. . . .” Sirius gave a 
"short, barklike laugh. “If my parent"
s could see the use it was being put 
"to now . . . well, my mother’s portrait"
 should give you some idea. . . .” 
"He scowled for a moment, then sighed. "
“I wouldn’t mind if I could just get out occasionally and do some-
thing useful. I’ve asked Dumbledore 
whether I can escort you to your 
"hearing — as Snuffles, obviously — "
so I can give you a bit of moral 
"support, what d’you think?” "
Harry felt as though his stomac
h had sunk through the dusty 
carpet. He had not thought about 
the hearing once 
since dinner the 
previous evening; in the excitement 
of being back with
 the people he 
"liked best, of hearing everything that was going on, it had completely "
"flown his mind. At Sirius’s words, however, the crushing sense of "
dread returned to him. He stared 
"at Hermione and the Weasleys, all "
"tucking into their sandwiches, and "
thought how he would feel if they 
went back to Hogw
arts without him. 
"“Don’t worry,” Sirius said. Harry look"
ed up and realized that Sirius 
had been watching him. “I’m sure th
"ey’re going to clear you, there’s "
definitely something in the Internat
ional Statute of 
Secrecy about be-
ing allowed to use magic to
 save your own life.” 
"“But if they do expel me,” said "
"Harry, quietly, “can I come back "
here and live with you?” 
Sirius smiled sadly. 
 116 “We’ll see.” 
“I’d feel a lot better ab
out the hearing if I knew
 I didn’t have to go 
"back to the Dursleys,” Harry pressed him. "
"“They must be bad if you prefer this place,” said Sirius gloomily. "
"“Hurry up, you two, or there won’t "
"be any food left,” Mrs. Weasley "
called. 
Sirius heaved another gr
"eat sigh, cast a dark "
"look at the tapestry, "
and he and Harry went 
to join the others. 
Harry tried his best not to think 
about the hearing while they emp-
"tied the glass cabinets that afternoon. Fortunately for him, it was a job "
that required a lot of concentration
", as many of the objects in there "
seemed very reluctant to leave thei
r dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a 
bad bite from a silver snuffbox; wi
"thin seconds, his bitten hand had "
developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove. 
"“It’s okay,” he said, examining th"
e hand with interest before tap-
ping it lightly with his wand and 
"restoring its skin to normal, “must "
be Wartcap powder in there.” 
He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing 
the debris from the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap his own hand 
carefully in a cloth moments later 
and sneak the box into his already 
doxy-filled pocket. 
They found an unplea
"sant-looking silver instrument, something "
like a many-legged pair of tweezer
"s, which scuttled"
 up Harry’s arm 
like a spider when he picked it 
"up, and attempted to puncture his "
skin; Sirius seized it and smashe
d it with a heavy book entitled 
Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy.
 There was a musical box 
"that emitted a faintly sinister, tink"
"ling tune when wound, and they all "
found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy until Ginny 
had the sense to slam the lid shut; 
also a heavy locket that none of 
"them could open, a number of ancient seals and, in a dusty box, an "
"Order of Merlin, First Class, that "
had been awarded to Sirius’s grand-
father for “Services to the Ministry.” 
   117 “It means he gave them a load of 
"gold,” said Sirius contemptuously, "
throwing the medal in
to the rubbish sack. 
"Several times, Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to "
"smuggle things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses "
every time they caught him at it
. When Sirius wrested a large golden 
ring bearing the Black crest from his grip Kreacher actually burst into 
furious tears and left the room so
bbing under his breath and calling 
Sirius names Harry ha
d never heard before. 
"“It was my father’s,” said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack. "
“Kreacher wasn’t 
quite
" as devoted to him as to my mother, but I still "
caught him snogging a pair of my 
father’s old trouse
rs last week.” 
Mrs. Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days. 
The drawing room took three days to
 decontaminate; finally the only 
undesirable things left in
" it were the tapestry of the Black family tree, "
which resisted all their attempts to
" remove it from the wall, and the "
rattling writing desk; Moody had not 
"dropped by headquarters yet, so "
they could not be sure
 what was inside it. 
They moved from the drawing r
oom to a dining room on the 
ground floor where they found spider
s large as saucers lurking in the 
dresser (Ron left the room hurriedly
 to make a cup of tea and did not 
return for an hour and a half). Th
"e china, which bore the Black crest "
"and motto, was all thrown unceremoni"
"ously into a sack by Sirius, and "
the same fate met a set of old phot
"ographs in tarnished silver frames, "
all of whose occupants squealed sh
rilly as the glass covering them 
smashed. 
Snape might refer to their work as
" “cleaning,” but in Harry’s opin-"
ion they were really waging war on
" the house, which was putting up a "
"very good fight, aided and abetted "
by Kreacher. The house-elf kept 
appearing wherever they were cong
"regated, his muttering becoming "
more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he 
could from the rubbish sacks. Sirius
 went as far as to threaten him 
 118 "with clothes, but Kreacher fixed "
"him with a watery stare and said, "
"“Master must do as Master wishes,” before turning away and mutter-"
"ing very loudly, “but Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because "
"Kreacher knows what they are up to, "
"oh yes, he is plotting against the "
"Dark Lord, yes, with these Mudbl"
oods and traitors and scum. . . .” 
"At which Sirius, ignoring Hermione’s protests, seized Kreacher by "
the back of his loincloth and th
rew him bodily from the room. 
"The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the cue for Sirius’s "
"mother to start shrieking again, "
and for Harry and the others to at-
"tempt to eavesdrop on the visitor, th"
ough they gleaned very little from 
the brief glimpses and snatches of 
conversation they were able to 
sneak before Mrs. Weasley recalled them to their tasks. Snape flitted in 
and out of the house several times mo
"re, though to Harry’s relief they "
never came face-to-face; he also ca
ught sight of his Transfiguration 
"teacher, Professor McGo"
"nagall, looking very odd in a Muggle dress "
"and coat, though she also s"
eemed too busy to linger. 
"Sometimes, however, the visitors st"
ayed to help; Tonks joined them 
for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old 
ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet
", and Lupin, who was staying in the "
house with Sirius but who left it 
for long periods to do mysterious 
"work for the Order, helped them re"
pair a grandfather clock that had 
developed the unpleasant habit of 
shooting heavy bolts at passersby. 
Mundungus redeemed himself slightly
 in Mrs. Weasley’s eyes by res-
cuing Ron from an ancient set of pu
rple robes that had tried to stran-
gle him when he removed th
em from their wardrobe. 
Despite the fact that he was still sl
"eeping badly, still having dreams "
about corridors and locked doors that
 made his scar 
"prickle, Harry "
was managing to have fun for the firs
t time all summer. As long as he 
was busy he was happy; when the 
"action abated, however, whenever "
"he dropped his guard, or lay exhaus"
ted in bed watching blurred shad-
"ows move across the ceiling, the "
thought of the lo
oming Ministry  
   119 hearing returned to him. Fear jabbed
 at his insides like needles as he 
wondered what was going to happen 
to him if he was expelled. The 
idea was so terrible that he did no
"t dare voice it aloud, not even to "
"Ron and Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering to-"
gether and casting anxious looks in 
"his direction, followed his lead in "
not mentioning it. Sometimes he 
could not prevent his imagination 
showing him a faceless 
Ministry official who wa
s snapping his wand 
in two and ordering him back to th
e Dursleys’ . . . but he would not 
go. He was determined on that. He would come back here to Grim-
mauld Place and li
ve with Sirius. 
He felt as though a brick had dr
opped into his stomach when Mrs. 
Weasley turned to him during dinn
er on Wednesday evening and said 
"quietly, “I’ve ironed your best "
"clothes for tomorrow morning, Harry, "
and I want you to wash your hair 
tonight too. A good first impression 
can work wonders.” 
"Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, an"
d Ginny all stopped talking and 
looked over at him. Harry nodded and 
"tried to keep eating his chops, "
but his mouth had become so
 dry he could not chew. 
“How am I getting there?” he aske
"d Mrs. Weasley, trying to sound "
unconcerned. 
“Arthur’s taking you to work with
" him,” said Mrs. Weasley gently. "
Mr. Weasley smiled encouragingl
y at Harry across the table. 
“You can wait in 
my office until it’s time 
"for the hearing,” he said. "
"Harry looked over at Sirius, but b"
"efore he could ask the question, "
Mrs. Weasley had answered it. 
“Professor Dumbledore doesn’t think it’s a good idea for Sirius to 
"go with you, and I must say I —” "
“— think he’s 
"quite right,"
”
said Sirius throug
h clenched teeth. 
Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips. 
“When did Dumbledore tell you 
"that?” Harry said, staring at "
Sirius. 
 120 "“He came last night, when you were in bed,” said Mr. Weasley. "
Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato
 with his fork. Harry dropped his 
own eyes to his plate. The though
t that Dumbledore had been in the 
house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him 
"feel, if that were po"
"ssible, even worse. "
arry awoke at half-past five th
e next morning as abruptly and 
completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few 
moments he lay immobile as the pros
pect of the hearing filled every 
"tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed "
and put on his glasses. 
Mrs. Weasley had laid ou
t his freshly laundered 
jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his
 bed. Harry scrambled into them. 
The blank picture on the 
wall sniggered again. 
Ron was lying sprawled on his back
" with his mouth wide open, fast "
asleep. He did not stir
 as Harry crossed the 
"room, stepped out onto "
"the landing, and closed the door so"
ftly behind him. Trying not to 
think of the next time he would s
"ee Ron, when they might no longer "
"be fellow students at Hogwarts, Ha"
"rry walked quietly down the stairs, "
past the heads of Kreacher’s an
"cestors, and into the kitchen. "
"He had expected it to be empty,"
 but it was not. When he reached 
the door he heard the soft rumble 
of voices on th
e other side and 
when he pushed it open he saw Mr. 
"and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin, "
and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him.  
H 
 122 All were fully dressed except Mrs. 
"Weasley, who was wearing a quilted, "
purple dressing gown. She leapt to
 her feet the moment he entered. 
"“Breakfast,” she said as she pulled "
out her wand and hurried over to 
the fire. 
"“M-m-morning, Harry,” yawned To"
nks. Her hair was blonde and 
curly this morning. 
“Sleep all right?” 
"“Yeah,” said Harry. "
“I’ve b-b-been up all 
"night,” she said, with another shuddering "
yawn. “Come and sit down. . . .” 
"She drew out a chair, knocking over "
the one beside it in the process. 
"“What do you want, Harry?” Mrs."
 Weasley called. “Porridge? 
Muffins? Kippers? Ba
con and eggs? Toast?” 
"“Just — just toast, thanks,” said Harry. "
"Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, “What were you saying "
about Scrimgeour?” 
"“Oh . . . yeah . . . well, we need to "
"be a bit more careful, he’s been "
asking Kingsley and me 
funny questions. . . .” 
Harry felt vaguely grateful that he 
was not required to join in the 
conversation. His insides were squirming. Mrs. Weasley placed a cou-
ple of pieces of toast and marmalade 
"in front of him; he tried to eat, "
but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs. Weasley sat down on his other 
side and started fussing with his 
"T-shirt, tucking in the label and "
smoothing out creases across the sh
oulders. He wished she wouldn’t. 
“. . . and I’ll have to tell Dumbledore I can’t do night duty tomor-
"row, I’m just t-t-too tired,” Tonk"
"s finished, yawnin"
g hugely again. 
"“I’ll cover for you,” said Mr. Weasley."
" “I’m okay, I’ve got a report to "
finish anyway. . . .” 
Mr. Weasley was not wearing wiza
rd’s robes but a pair of pin-
striped trousers and an old bomber 
jacket. He turned from Tonks to 
Harry. 
“How are you feeling?” 
   123 Harry shrugged. 
"“It’ll all be over soon,” Mr. Weasle"
y said bracingly. “In a few hours’ 
time you’ll be cleared.” 
Harry said nothing. 
"“The hearing’s on my floor, in Amel"
ia Bones’s office. She’s Head of 
the Department of Magical Law Enfo
rcement and she’s the one who’ll 
be questioning you.” 
"“Amelia Bones is okay, Harry,” said"
" Tonks earnestly. “She’s fair, "
she’ll hear you out.” 
"Harry nodded, still unable to"
 think of anything to say. 
"“Don’t lose your temper,” said Si"
rius abruptly. “Be polite and stick 
to the facts.” 
Harry nodded again. 
"“The law’s on your side,” said "
Lupin quietly. “Even underage wiz-
ards are allowed to use magic in
 life-threatening situations.” 
Something very cold tr
ickled down the back 
of Harry’s neck; for a 
moment he thought someone was 
putting a Disillusionment Charm 
"on him again, then he realized th"
at Mrs. Weasley was attacking his 
hair with a wet comb. She presse
d hard on the top of his head. 
“Doesn’t it ever lie flat
?” she said desperately. 
Harry shook his head. 
Mr. Weasley checked his watch 
and looked up at Harry. 
"“I think we’ll go now,” he said. “We’"
"re a bit early, but I think you’ll "
be better off there than
 hanging around here.” 
"“Okay,” said Harry automa"
"tically, dropping his "
toast and getting to 
his feet. 
"“You’ll be all right, Harry,” said "
"Tonks, patting him on the arm. "
"“Good luck,” said Lupin. “I’m sure it will be fine.” "
"“And if it’s not,” said Sirius grimly, “I’ll see to Amelia Bones for "
you. . . .” 
Harry smiled weakly. Mrs.
 Weasley hugged him. 
 124 “We’ve all got our fing
"ers crossed,” she said. "
"“Right,” said Harry. “Well "
. . . see you later then.” 
He followed Mr. Weasley upstairs 
and along the hall. He could hear 
Sirius’s mother grunting in her sl
eep behind her curtains. Mr. Weasley 
unbolted the door and th
ey stepped out into 
"the cold, gray dawn. "
“You don’t normally walk to 
"work, do you?” Harry asked him, as "
they set off briskly 
around the square. 
"“No, I usually Apparate,” said Mr. "
"Weasley, “but obviously you can’t, "
and I think it’s best we arrive in 
a thoroughly non-magical fashion . . . 
"makes a better impression, given what yo"
u’re being discipli
ned for. . . .” 
Mr. Weasley kept his hand inside 
his jacket as they walked. Harry 
knew it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were 
"almost deserted, but when they arri"
ved at the miserable little Under-
ground station they found it alre
ady full of early morning commuters. 
As ever when he found himself in 
close proximity to Muggles going 
"about their daily business, Mr. Weas"
ley was hard put to contain his 
enthusiasm. 
"“Simply fabulous,” he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket "
machines. “Wonderfully ingenious.” 
"“They’re out of order,” said "
"Harry, pointing at the sign. "
"“Yes, but even so . . .” said Mr. "
"Weasley, beaming fondly at them. "
They bought their tickets inst
ead from a sleepy-looking guard 
"(Harry handled the transaction, as Mr. Weasley was not very good "
with Muggle money) and five minute
s later they were boarding an 
Underground train that rattled them off toward the center of London. 
Mr. Weasley kept anxiously chec
king and rechecking the Under-
ground map above the windows. 
"“Four stops, Harry . . . three stops "
"left now . . . two stops to go, "
Harry . . .” 
They got off at a station in the 
"very heart of London, swept from "
the train in a tide of besuited men 
and women carrying briefcases. Up  
   125 "the escalator they went, through "
the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley 
"delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged "
onto a broad street lined with im
"posing-looking buildings, already "
full of traffic. 
"“Where are we?” said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for one heart-"
stopping moment Harry thought they
 had gotten off at the wrong sta-
tion despite Mr. Weasley’s contin
ual references to the map; but a 
"second later he said, “Ah yes . . . this way, Harry,” and led him down "
a side road. 
"“Sorry,” he said, “but I never come "
by train and it all looks rather 
different from a Muggle perspective. 
As a matter of fact I’ve never 
even used the visitor’
s entrance before.” 
"The farther they walked, the smaller and less imposing the build-"
"ings became, until finally they reached a street that contained several "
"rather shabby-looking offices, a pu"
"b, and an overflowing dumpster. "
Harry had expected a rather more impr
essive location for the Ministry 
of Magic. 
"“Here we are,” said Mr. Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red "
"telephone box, which wa"
s missing several panes of glass and stood be-
fore a heavily graffittied 
"wall. “After you, Harry.” "
He opened the telephone box door. 
"Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr. "
Weasley folded himself in beside 
Harry and closed 
the door. It was a 
tight fit; Harry was jammed against 
"the telephone apparatus, which "
was hanging crookedly from the wall 
as though a vandal had tried to 
rip it off. Mr. Weasley reache
d past Harry for the receiver. 
"“Mr. Weasley, I think this might "
"be out of order too,” Harry said. "
"“No, no, I’m sure it’s fine,” said "
"Mr. Weasley, holding the receiver "
above his head and peering at the dial. 
“Let’s see . . . six . . .” he dialed 
"the number, “two . . . four . . . "
and another four . . . and another 
two . . .” 
 126 As the dial whirred smoothly back 
"into place, a cool female voice "
"sounded inside the telephone box,"
 not from the receiver in Mr. 
"Weasley’s hand, but as loudly and "
plainly as though an invisible 
woman were standing right beside them. 
“Welcome to the Ministry of Magi
c. Please state your name and 
business.” 
"“Er . . .” said Mr. Weasley, clearl"
y uncertain whether he should talk 
into the receiver or not; he compromised by holding the mouthpiece 
"to his ear, “Arthur Weasley, Misuse"
" of Muggle Artifacts Office, here "
"to escort Harry Potter, who has been "
asked to attend a disciplinary 
hearing. . . .” 
"“Thank you,” said the cool female "
"voice. “Visitor, please take the "
badge and attach it to the front of your robes.” 
"There was a click and a rattle, "
and Harry saw something slide out 
of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked 
it up: It was a square silver badge with 
"Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hear-"
ing
 on it. He pinned it to the front 
of his T-shirt as the female voice 
spoke again. 
"“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and "
present your wand for registration 
"at the security desk, which is lo-"
cated at the far end of the Atrium.” 
The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking 
slowly into the ground. Harry watc
hed apprehensively as the pave-
ment rose up past the glass window
s of the telephone box until dark-
ness closed over their heads. Then he 
could see nothing at all; he could 
only hear a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way 
down through the earth. After about 
"a minute, though it felt much "
"longer to Harry, a chin"
k of golden light illumi
"nated his feet and, "
"widening, rose up his body, until it "
hit him in the face and he had to 
blink to stop his ey
es from watering. 
“The Ministry of Magic wishes 
"you a pleasant day,” said the "
woman’s voice. 
   127 The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. Weasley 
"stepped out of it, followed by Ha"
"rry, whose mouth had fallen open. "
They were standing at one end of 
a very long and splendid hall with a 
"highly polished, dark w"
ood floor. The peacock-blue
 ceiling was inlaid 
with gleaming golden symbols that 
were continually moving and chang-
ing like some enormous heavenly noti
ce board. The walls on each side 
were paneled in shiny dark wood and 
had many gilded fi
replaces set into 
them. Every few seconds a witch or 
wizard would emerge from one of 
the left-hand fireplaces with a soft 
whoosh
"; on the right-hand side, short "
"queues of wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart. "
Halfway down the hall was a founta
"in. A group of golden statues, "
"larger than life-size, stood in the mi"
ddle of a circular pool. Tallest of 
them all was a noble-look
ing wizard with his wand pointing straight 
up in the air. Grouped around him 
"were a beautiful witch, a centaur, "
"a goblin, and a house-elf. The last "
three were all look
ing adoringly up 
at the witch and wizard. 
Glittering jets of water were flying from the 
"ends of the two wands, the point of"
" the centaur’s arrow, the tip of "
"the goblin’s hat, and each of the ho"
"use-elf’s ears, so that the tinkling "
hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of Apparators 
and the clatter of footsteps as hund
"reds of witches and wizards, most "
"of whom were wearing glum, early-mo"
"rning looks, strode toward a set "
of golden gates at th
e far end of the hall. 
"“This way,” said"
 Mr. Weasley. 
"They joined the throng, wendin"
g their way between the Ministry 
"workers, some of whom were carryi"
"ng tottering piles of parchment, "
"others battered briefcases, still others reading the "
Daily Prophet
 as they 
walked. As they passed the founta
in Harry saw silver Sickles and 
bronze Knuts glinting up at hi
m from the bottom of the pool. A 
"small, smudged sign beside it read: "
All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will be given to 
St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries 
 128 "If I’m not expelled from Hogwarts, I’ll put in ten Galleons,"
 Harry 
found himself thinking desperately. 
"“Over here, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they stepped out of the "
"stream of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates, toward a "
"desk on the left, over which hung a sign saying "
security
. A badly 
shaven wizard in peacock-blue robes looked up as they approached 
and put down his 
Daily Prophet.
"“I’m escorting a visitor,” said Mr"
". Weasley, gesturing toward Harry. "
"“Step over here,” said the wizard in a bored voice. "
Harry walked closer to him and the 
wizard held up a long golden 
"rod, thin and flexible as a car aeri"
"al, and passed it up and down Harry’s "
front and back. 
"“Wand,” grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the "
golden instrument and 
holding out his hand. 
Harry produced his wand. The wizard
 dropped it onto a strange 
"brass instrument, which looked some"
thing like a set of scales with 
only one dish. It began to vibrate.
 A narrow strip of parchment came 
speeding out of a slit in the base. Th
e wizard tore this off and read the 
writing upon it. 
"“Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core"
", been in use four years. That "
correct?” 
"“Yes,” said Harry nervously. "
"“I keep this,” said the wizard, im"
paling the slip of
 parchment on a 
small brass spike. “You get this back
",” he added, thrusting the wand at "
Harry. 
“Thank you.” 
“Hang on. . . .” said the wizard slowly. 
His eyes had darted from the silver
 visitor’s badge on Harry’s chest 
to his forehead. 
"“Thank you, Eric,” said Mr. Weas"
"ley firmly, and grasping Harry by "
"the shoulder, he steered him away "
from the desk and back into the 
stream of wizards and 
witches walking through the golden gates. 
   129 "Jostled slightly by the crowd, "
Harry followed Mr. Weasley through 
the gates into the smaller hall beyond
", where at least twenty lifts stood "
behind wrought golden grilles. 
Harry and Mr. Weas
ley joined the 
"crowd around one of them. A big,"
 bearded wizard holding a large 
cardboard box stood near
by. The box was emitting rasping noises. 
"“All right, Arthur?” said the "
"wizard, nodding at Mr. Weasley. "
"“What’ve you got there, Bob?” as"
"ked Mr. Weasley, looking at the "
box. 
"“We’re not sure,” said the wizard"
 seriously. “We thought it was a 
bog-standard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a seri-
ous breach of the Ban on Expe
rimental Breeding to me.” 
With a great jangling and clatteri
ng a lift descended in front of 
them; the golden grille slid back 
and Harry and Mr. 
Weasley moved in-
side it with the rest of the crowd. Harry found himself jammed against 
the back wall of the lift. Several 
witches and wizards 
were looking at 
him curiously; he stared at his feet 
"to avoid catching anyone’s eye, flat-"
tening his fringe as he did so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the 
"lift ascended slowly, chains rattling "
"all the while, while the same cool "
female voice Harry had heard in th
e telephone box rang out again. 
"“Level seven, Department of Ma"
"gical Games and Sports, incorpo-"
rating the British and Irish Quiddi
"tch League Headquarters, Official "
"Gobstones Club, and Ludicrous Patents Office.” "
The lift doors opened; Harry glimps
"ed an untidy-looking corridor, "
with various posters of Quidditch 
teams tacked lopsidedly on the 
walls; one of the wizards in the li
"ft, who was carrying an armful of "
"broomsticks, extricated himself wi"
th difficulty and disappeared down 
"the corridor. The doors closed, the li"
"ft juddered upward again, and the "
"woman’s voice said, “Level six, Depa"
"rtment of Magical Transport, in-"
corporating the Floo Network Author
"ity, Broom Regulatory Control, "
"Portkey Office, and Apparation Test Center.” "
Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and 
wizards got out; at the same time
", several paper airplanes swooped "
 130 into the lift. Harry stared up at th
em as they flapped idly around 
above his head; they were a pale
 violet color and he could see 
ministry 
of magic
 stamped along the edges of their wings. 
"“Just Interdepartmental memos,” Mr. Weasley muttered to him. "
"“We used to use owls, but the mess "
was unbelievable . 
. . droppings all 
over the desks . . .” 
"As they clattered upward again,"
 the memos flapped around the 
swaying lamp in the lift’s ceiling. 
"“Level five, Department of International Magical Cooperation, in-"
"corporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the "
International Magical Office of La
"w, and the International Confeder-"
"ation of Wizards,"
 British Seats.” 
"When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few "
"more witches and wizards, but severa"
"l more memos zoomed in, so that "
the light from the lamp in the ceil
ing flickered and flashed as they 
darted around it. 
"“Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of "
"Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, "
"Goblin Liaison Office, and "
Pest Advisory Bureau.” 
"“’S’cuse,” said the wizard carryi"
ng the fire-breathing chicken and 
he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged 
shut yet again. 
"“Level three, Department of Ma"
"gical Accidents and Catastrophes, "
including the Accidental Magic Re
"versal Squad, Obliviator Head-"
"quarters, and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.” "
Everybody left the lift on this fl
"oor except Mr. Weasley, Harry, and "
a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that 
was trailing on the ground. The re
maining memos continued to soar 
"around the lamp as the lift juddered upward again, and then the doors "
"opened and the voice said, “Level "
"two, Department of Magical Law "
"Enforcement, including the Improp"
"er Use of Magic Office, Auror "
"Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services.” "
   131 "“This is us, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they followed the witch "
out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors. “My office is on the 
other side of the floor.” 
"“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, as th"
ey passed a window through which 
"sunlight was streaming, “aren’t we underground?” "
"“Yes, we are,” said Mr. Weasley,"
 “those are enchanted windows; 
Magical Maintenance decide what 
weather we’re getting every day. 
We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a 
pay raise. . . . Just
" round here, Harry.” "
"They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors, "
"and emerged in a cluttered, open "
"area divided into cubicles, which "
were buzzing with talk and laught
er. Memos were zooming in and out 
of cubicles like miniature rockets. 
A lopsided sign on the nearest cu-
bicle read 
auror headquarters
. 
Harry looked surreptitiously throug
h the doorways as they passed. 
The Aurors had covered their cubicl
e walls with everything from pic-
tures of wanted wizards and photogra
"phs of their families, to posters "
of their favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the 
Daily Prophet.
A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer than Bill’s was sitting with 
"his boots up on his desk, dictating a re"
port to his quill. A little farther 
"along, a witch with a patch over her eye was talking over the top of her "
cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt. 
"“Morning, Weasley,” said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer. "
“I’ve been wanting a word with 
"you, have you got a second?” "
"“Yes, if it really is a second,” said Mr. Weasley, “I’m in rather a "
hurry.” 
They were talking to each other as
 though they hardly knew each 
"other, and when Harry op"
"ened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr. "
Weasley stood on his foot. They fo
llowed Kingsley along the row and 
into the very last cubicle. 
Harry received a slight shock; Siri
us’s face was blinking down at 
him from every direction. Newspa
per cuttings and old photographs 
 132 — even the one of Sirius being be
st man at the Potters’ wedding — 
papered the walls. The only Sirius-f
ree space was a map of the world 
in which little red pins were glowing like jewels. 
"“Here,” said Kingsley brusquely to"
" Mr. Weasley, shoving a sheaf of "
"parchment into his hand, “I need as"
 much information as possible on 
flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We’ve re-
ceived information that 
Black might still be usin
g his old motorcycle.” 
Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous 
"wink and added, in a whisper, "
"“Give him the magazine, he might find"
 it interesting.” Then he said in 
"normal tones, “And don’t take too "
"long, Weasley, the delay on that "
firelegs report held our in
vestigation up for a month.” 
“If you had read my report you would know that the term is 
"‘firearms,’” said Mr. Weasley coolly. "
“And I’m afraid you’ll have to wait 
"for information on motorcycles, "
we’re extremely busy at the mo-
ment.” He dropped his voice and sa
"id, “If you can get away before "
"seven, Molly’s making meatballs.” "
He beckoned to Harry and led him
" out of Kingsley’s cubicle, "
"through a second set of oak doors, "
"into another passage, turned left, "
"marched along another corridor, turned"
 right into a dimly lit and dis-
"tinctly shabby corridor, and finall"
"y reached a dead end, where a door "
"on the left stood ajar, revealing a "
"broom cupboard, and a door on the "
right bore a tarnished 
brass plaque reading 
misuse of muggle 
artifacts
. 
Mr. Weasley’s dingy office seemed 
to be slightly smaller than the 
broom cupboard. Two desks had been 
crammed inside it and there was 
barely room to move around them be
cause of all the overflowing filing 
"cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files. "
The little wall space available bore witness to Mr. Weasley’s obsessions; 
"there were several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine, "
two illustrations of postboxes he s
eemed to have cut out of Muggle 
"children’s books, and a diagra"
m showing how to wire a plug. 
Sitting on top of Mr. Weasley’s 
overflowing in-tray was an old 
   133 toaster that was hiccuping in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty 
leather gloves that were twiddling 
their thumbs. A ph
otograph of the 
Weasley family stood beside the in-t
ray. Harry noticed that Percy ap-
peared to have walked out of it. 
"“We haven’t got a window,” said Mr. Weasley apologetically, taking "
off his bomber jacket an
d placing it on the back
 of his chair. “We’ve 
"asked, but they don’t seem to thin"
"k we need one. Have a seat, Harry, "
doesn’t look as if 
Perkins is in yet.” 
Harry squeezed himself into the ch
air behind Perkins’s desk while 
Mr. Weasley rifled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shackle-
bolt had given him. 
"“Ah,” he said, grinning, as he ex"
tracted a copy of a magazine enti-
tled 
The Quibbler
" from its midst, “yes . . .” He flicked through it. "
"“Yes, he’s right, I’m sure Sirius wi"
"ll find that very amusing — oh dear, "
what’s this now?” 
A memo had just zoomed in thro
ugh the open door and fluttered 
to rest on top of the hiccuping toaster. Mr. Weasley unfolded it and 
"read aloud, “‘Third regurgitating pu"
blic toilet reported in Bethnal 
"Green, kindly investigate immediately.’ "
This is getting ridiculous. . . .” 
“A regurgitating toilet?” 
"“Anti-Muggle pranksters,” said Mr. Weasley, frowning. “We had "
"two last week, one in Wimbledon, "
one in Elephant and Castle. Mug-
gles are pulling the flush and inst
ead of everything disappearing — 
"well, you can imagine. Th"
e poor things keep calling in those — those 
"pumbles,"
" I think they’re called — you know, the ones who mend pipes "
and things —” 
“Plumbers?” 
"“— exactly, yes, but of course they’re flummoxed. I only hope we "
can catch whoeve
r’s doing it.” 
“Will it be Aurors
 who catch them?” 
"“Oh no, this is too trivial for Auro"
"rs, it’ll be the ordinary Magical "
"Law Enforcement Patrol — ah, "
"Harry, this is Perkins.” "
 134 "A stooped, timid-looking old wizard "
with fluffy white hair had just 
"entered the room, panting. "
“Oh Arthur!” he said desperat
"ely, without looking at Harry. "
"“Thank goodness, I didn’t know wh"
"at to do for the best, whether to "
"wait here for you or not, I’ve just sent an owl to your home but you’ve "
obviously missed it — an urgent 
message came ten minutes ago —” 
“I know about the regurgitatin
"g toilet,” said Mr. Weasley. "
"“No, no, it’s not the toilet, it’s the Potter boy’s hearing — they’ve "
changed the time and venu
e — it starts at eigh
t o’clock now and it’s 
down in old Courtroom Ten —” 
“Down in old — but they told me — Merlin’s beard —” 
"Mr. Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp, and leapt from his "
chair. 
"“Quick, Harry, we should have "
been there five minutes ago!” 
Perkins flattened himself against th
e filing cabinets as Mr. Weasley 
left the office at a ru
"n, Harry on his heels. "
“Why have they changed the time?”
 Harry said breath
lessly as they 
hurtled past the Auror cubicles; people poked out their heads and 
stared as they streaked 
past. Harry felt as though 
he had left all his in-
sides back at Perkins’s desk. 
"“I’ve no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if you’d "
missed it it would have been catastrophic!” 
Mr. Weasley skidded to a halt be
side the lifts and jabbed impa-
tiently at the down button. 
“Come ON!” 
The lift clattered into view and th
ey hurried inside. Every time it 
stopped Mr. Weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number 
nine button. 
"“Those courtrooms haven’t been used in years,” said Mr. Weasley "
angrily. “I can’t think why they’r
e doing it down there — unless — 
but no . . .” 
   135 A plump witch carrying a smoking go
blet entered the 
lift at that 
"moment, and Mr. Weasle"
y did not elaborate. 
"“The Atrium,” said the cool femal"
e voice and the golden grilles slid 
"open, showing Harry a di"
stant glimpse of the go
lden statues in the 
fountain. The plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with 
a very mournful face got in. 
"“Morning, Arthur,” he said in a sepu"
lchral voice as the lift began to 
descend. “Don’t often se
e you down here. . . .” 
"“Urgent business, Bode,” said Mr"
". Weasley, who was bouncing on "
the balls of his feet and throwing
 anxious looks over at Harry. 
"“Ah, yes,” said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. “Of course.” "
Harry barely had emotion to spar
"e for Bode, but his unfaltering "
gaze did not make him feel
 any more comfortable. 
"“Department of Mysteries,” said the c"
"ool female voice, and left it at "
that. 
"“Quick, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley as "
"the lift doors rattled open, and "
they sped up a corridor that was qu
ite different from those above. The 
walls were bare; there were no 
windows and no doors apart from a 
plain black one set at the very 
end of the corridor. Harry expected 
"them to go through it, but instead "
Mr. Weasley seized him by the arm 
"and dragged him to the left, where "
there was an opening leading to a 
flight of steps. 
"“Down here, down here,” panted Mr. Weasley, taking two steps at "
a time. “The lift doesn’t ev
en come down this far . . . 
why
 they’re do-
ing it there . . .” 
They reached the bottom of the 
steps and ran al
ong yet another 
"corridor, which bore a great resemblance to that which led to Snape’s "
"dungeon at Hogwarts, with rough st"
one walls and torches in brackets. 
The doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts 
and keyholes. 
“Courtroom . . . ten . . . I thin
k . . . we’re nearly . . . yes.” 
 136 Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt ou
tside a grimy dark door with an 
immense iron lock and slumped agains
"t the wall, clutching at a stitch "
in his chest. 
"“Go on,” he panted, pointing his thumb at the door. “Get in "
there.” 
“Aren’t — aren’t you coming with — ?” 
"“No, no, I’m not al"
lowed. Good luck!” 
Harry’s heart was beating a violent 
tattoo against his Adam’s apple. 
"He swallowed hard, turned the heav"
y iron door hand
"le, and stepped "
inside the courtroom. 
arry gasped; he could not help himself. The large dungeon he 
had entered was horribly famili
ar. He had not only seen it 
"before, he had "
been
 here before: This was the place he had visited in-
"side Dumbledore’s Pensieve, the "
place where he had watched the 
Lestranges sentenced to life
 imprisonment in Azkaban. 
The walls were made of dark sto
"ne, dimly lit by torches. Empty "
benches rose on either side of him
", but ahead, in th"
e highest benches 
"of all, were many shadowy figure"
s. They had been talking in low 
"voices, but as the heavy door swun"
g closed behind Harry an ominous 
silence fell. 
A cold male voice rang across the courtroom. 
“You’re late.” 
"“Sorry,” said Harry nervously. “I-I didn’t know the time had "
changed.” 
“That is not the Wizengamot’s fau
"lt,” said the voice. “An owl was "
sent to you this morning. Take your seat.” 
Harry dropped his gaze to the chair 
in the center of
" the room, the "
arms of which were covered in chains. He had seen those chains spring 
H 
 138 to life and bind whoever sat be
tween them. His footsteps echoed 
loudly as he walked across the stone floor. When he sat gingerly on the 
edge of the chair the chains clinke
d rather threateningly but did not 
bind him. Feeling rather sick he look
ed up at the people seated at the 
bench above. 
"There were about fifty of them, all,"
" as far as he could see, wearing "
plum-colored robes with an elaborat
ely worked silver W on the left-
hand side of the chest and all st
"aring down their noses at him, some "
"with very austere expressions, others looks of frank curiosity. "
"In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge, the Min-"
ister of Magic. Fudge was a portly 
man who often spor
ted a lime-green 
"bowler hat, though today he had di"
spensed with it; he had dispensed 
too with the indulgent smile he 
had once worn when he spoke to 
"Harry. A broad, square-jawed witch with very short gray hair sat on "
Fudge’s left; she wore a monocle an
d looked forbidding. On Fudge’s 
"right was another witch, but she was "
sitting so far ba
ck on the bench 
that her face 
was in shadow. 
"“Very well,” said Fudge. “The a"
ccused being present — finally — 
let us begin. Are you ready?
” he called down the row. 
"“Yes, sir,” said an eager voice Ha"
rry knew. Ron’s brother Percy was 
"sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, ex-"
pecting some sign of recognition 
"from him, but none came. Percy’s "
"eyes, behind his horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a "
quill poised in his hand. 
"“Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,” said Fudge in a "
"ringing voice, and Percy began taki"
"ng notes at once, “into offenses "
committed under the Decree for the 
Reasonable Restriction of Un-
derage Sorcery and the Internatio
nal Statute of Secrecy by Harry 
"James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, "
Surrey. 
"“Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic; "
"Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the "
Department of Magical Law En-
   139 forcement; Dolores Ja
"ne Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the "
"Minister. Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley —” "
"“— Witness for the defense, Albu"
s Percival Wulfric Brian Dumble-
"dore,” said a quiet voic"
"e from behind Harry, wh"
o turned his head so 
fast he cricked his neck. 
Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long 
midnight-blue robes and a perfectly 
calm expression. His long silver 
beard and hair gleamed in the torchl
ight as he drew level with Harry 
and looked up at Fudge through the 
half-moon spectacles that rested 
halfway down his 
very crooked nose. 
The members of the Wizengamot we
re muttering. All eyes were 
now on Dumbledore. Some looked a
"nnoyed, others slightly fright-"
ened; two elderly witches in
" the back row, however, raised their hands "
and waved in welcome. 
A powerful emotion had risen in 
Harry’s chest at the sight of Dum-
"bledore, a fortified, hopeful feelin"
g rather like that which phoenix 
"song gave him. He wanted to catch Dumbledore’s eye, but Dumble-"
dore was not looking his way; he wa
s continuing to look up at the 
obviously flustered Fudge. 
"“Ah,” said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted. “Dumble-"
dore. Yes. You — er — got our — er
 — message that the time and — 
er — place of the hearing 
had been chan
"ged, then?” "
"“I must have missed it,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. “However, "
"due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so "
no harm done.” 
“Yes — well — I suppose we’
ll need another chair — I — 
"Weasley, could you — ?” "
"“Not to worry, not to worry,” said"
 Dumbledore pleasantly; he took 
"out his wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair ap-"
peared out of nowhere next to Ha
"rry. Dumbledore sat down, put the "
"tips of his long fingers together, an"
d looked at Fudge over them with 
an expression of polite interest. The Wizengamot was still muttering 
 140 and fidgeting restlessly; only when Fudge spoke again did they settle 
down. 
"“Yes,” said Fudge again, shufflin"
"g his notes. “Well, then. So. The "
charges. Yes.” 
He extricated a piece of
 parchment from the pi
"le before him, took "
"a deep breath, and read, “The char"
ges against the accused are as fol-
"lows: That he did knowingly, delibe"
"rately, and in full awareness of the "
"illegality of his actions, having "
received a previous written warning 
from the Ministry of Magic on a si
"milar charge, produce a Patronus "
"Charm in a Muggle-inhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on "
August the second at twenty-three 
"minutes past nine, which consti-"
tutes an offense under paragraph C 
of the Decree for the Reasonable 
"Restriction of Underage Sorcery, "
"1875, and also under section thir-"
teen of the International Confederation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy. 
"“You are Harry James Potter, of numb"
"er four, Privet Drive, Little "
"Whinging, Surrey?” Fudge said, glar"
ing at Harry over the top of his 
parchment. 
"“Yes,” Harry said. "
“You received an official warning 
from the Ministry for using ille-
gal magic three years 
"ago, did you not?” "
"“Yes, but —” "
“And yet you conjured a Patronus 
on the night of the second of 
August?” said Fudge. 
"“Yes,” said Ha"
"rry, “but —” "
“Knowing that you are not permit
ted to use magic outside school 
while you are under th
e age of seventeen?” 
"“Yes, but —” "
“Knowing that you were in 
an area full of Muggles?” 
"“Yes, but —” "
“Fully aware that you were in cl
ose proximity to a Muggle at the 
time? 
“
"Yes,"
"” said Harry angrily, “but I only"
 used it because we were —” 
   141 The witch with the monocle on Fudge’s left cut across him in a 
booming voice. 
“You produced a full
y fledged Patronus?” 
"“Yes,” said Harry, “because —” "
“A corporeal Patronus?” 
“A — what?” said Harry. 
“Your Patronus had a cl
"early defined form? I mean to say, it was "
more than vapor or smoke?” 
"“Yes,” said Harry, feeling both im"
"patient and slightly desperate, "
"“it’s a stag, it’s always a stag.” "
“Always?” boomed Madam Bones. “Y
ou have produced a Patronus 
before now?” 
“
"Yes,"
"” said Harry, “I’ve been doing it for over a year —” "
“And you are fifteen years old?” 
"“Yes, and —” "
“You learned this
 at school?” 
"“Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in "
"my third year, because of the —” "
"“Impressive,” said Madam Bones, staring down at him, “a true "
Patronus at that age . . . 
very impressive indeed.” 
Some of the wizards and witches ar
ound her were muttering again; 
"a few nodded, but others were fr"
owning and shaking their heads. 
"“It’s not a question of how impressive the magic was,” said Fudge "
"in a testy voice. “In fact, the more "
"impressive the worse it is, I would "
"have thought, given that the boy di"
d it in plain view of a Muggle!” 
"Those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement, but "
it was the sight of Percy’s sanctimo
nious little nod that goaded Harry 
into speech. 
“I did it because of the dementors!
"” he said loudly, before anyone "
could interrupt him again. 
"He had expected more muttering, "
but the silence that fell seemed 
to be somehow denser than before. 
“Dementors?” said Madam Bones af
"ter a moment, raising her thick "
 142 eyebrows so that her mo
nocle looked in danger 
of falling out. “What 
"do you mean, boy?” "
“I mean there were two dementor
s down that alleyway and they 
went for me and my cousin!” 
"“Ah,” said Fudge again, smirking un"
pleasantly as he looked around 
"at the Wizengamot, as though inviti"
ng them to share the joke. “Yes. 
"Yes, I thought we’d be hearing something like this.” "
“Dementors in Little Whinging?”
 Madam Bones said in tones of 
great surprise. “I do
n’t understand —” 
"“Don’t you, Amelia?” said Fudge, "
still smirking. “Let me explain. 
He’s been thinking it through an
d decided dementors would make a 
"very nice little cover story, very "
nice indeed. Muggles can’t see demen-
"tors, can they, boy? Highly convenient"
", highly convenient . . . so it’s "
just your word and no
 witnesses. . . .” 
“I’m not lying!” said Harry loudly
", over another outbreak of mut-"
"tering from the court. “There were two of them, coming from oppo-"
"site ends of the alley, everything w"
ent dark and cold and my cousin 
felt them and ran for it —” 
"“Enough, enough!” said Fudge with"
 a very supercilious look on his 
face. “I’m sorry to interrupt what I’m sure would have been a very 
well-rehearsed story —” 
Dumbledore cleared his 
throat. The Wizengamot fell silent again. 
"“We do, in fact, have a witness to "
the presence of dementors in that 
"alleyway,” he said, “other than Dudley Dursley, I mean.” "
Fudge’s plump face seemed to slac
"ken, as though somebody had let "
air out of it. He stared down at 
"Dumbledore for a moment or two, "
"then, with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together, "
"said, “We haven’t got time to list"
"en to more taradiddles, I’m afraid, "
Dumbledore. I want this dealt with quickly —” 
"“I may be wrong,” said Dumbledore pleasantly, “but I am sure that "
under the Wizengamot Charter of Righ
"ts, the accused has the right to  "
   143 present witnesses for his or her case
? Isn’t that the policy of the De-
partment of Magical Law Enforc
"ement, Madam Bones?” he contin-"
"ued, addressing the wi"
tch in the monocle. 
"“True,” said Madam Bones. “Perfectly true.” "
"“Oh, very well, very well,” snapped "
Fudge. “Where is
 this person?” 
"“I brought her with me,” said Dumbledore. “She’s just outside the "
door. Should I — ?” 
"“No — Weasley, you go,” Fudge ba"
"rked at Percy, who got up at "
"once, hurried down the stone steps from the judge’s balcony, and has-"
tened past Dumbledor
e and Harry without 
glancing at them. 
"A moment later, Percy returned, fo"
llowed by Mrs. Figg. She looked 
scared and more batty than ever
. Harry wished she had thought to 
change out of her 
carpet slippers. 
"Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs. Figg his chair, conjuring a "
second one for himself. 
"“Full name?” said Fudge loudly, when Mrs. Figg had perched her-"
self nervously on the 
very edge of her seat. 
"“Arabella Doreen Figg,” said Mr"
s. Figg in her quavery voice. 
"“And who exactly are you?” said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice. "
“I’m a resident of Little Whin
"ging, close to where Harry Potter "
"lives,” said Mrs. Figg. "
“We have no record of any witch or
 wizard living in Little Whing-
"ing other than Harry Potter,” said "
Madam Bones at once. “That situ-
"ation has always been closely monitored, given . . . given past events.” "
"“I’m a Squib,” said Mrs. Figg. “So "
"you wouldn’t have me registered, "
would you?” 
"“A Squib, eh?” said Fudge, eyeing her suspiciously. “We’ll be check-"
ing that. You’ll leave details of yo
"ur parentage with my assistant, "
"Weasley. Incidentally, can Squibs "
"see dementors?” he added, looking "
left and right along the bench where he sat. 
"“Yes, we can!” said Mr"
s. Figg indignantly. 
 144 "Fudge looked back down at her, his"
" eyebrows raised. “Very well,” "
he said coolly. “What is your story?” 
“I had gone out to buy cat food from
 the corner shop at the end of 
"Wisteria Walk, shortly after nine on the evening of the second of "
"August,” gabbled Mrs. Figg at once"
", as though she had learned what "
"she was saying by heart, “when I heard a disturbance down the alley-"
way between Magnolia Crescent an
d Wisteria Walk. On approaching 
the mouth of the alleyway 
I saw dementors running —” 
"“Running?” said Madam Bones sharply. “Dementors don’t run, "
they glide.” 
"“That’s what I meant to say,” said"
" Mrs. Figg quickly, patches of "
pink appearing in her withered ch
eeks. “Gliding along the alley to-
ward what looked like two boys.” 
“What did they look like?” said 
"Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes "
so that the monocle’s edges 
disappeared into her flesh. 
"“Well, one was very large and th"
e other one rather skinny —” 
"“No, no,” said Madam Bones impati"
"ently, “the dementors . . . de-"
scribe them.” 
"“Oh,” said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now. "
“They were big. Big and wearing cloaks.” 
Harry felt a horrible sinking in the 
pit of his stomach. Whatever 
"Mrs. Figg said to the contrary, it sounded to him as though the most "
she had ever seen was a picture of
" a dementor, and a picture could "
never convey the truth of what thes
e beings were like: the eerie way 
"they moved, hovering inches over "
"the ground, or the rotting smell of "
"them, or that terrible, rattling noise they made as they sucked on the "
surrounding air . . . A dumpy wizard
 with a large black mustache in 
the second row leaned close to his 
"neighbor, a frizzy-haired witch, and "
whispered something in her ea
r. She smirked and nodded. 
"“Big and wearing cloaks,” repe"
"ated Madam Bones coolly, while "
Fudge snorted derisively. “I
 see. Anything else?” 
   145 "“Yes,” said Mrs. Figg. “I felt th"
"em. Everything went cold, and this "
"was a very warm summer’s night, mark you. And I felt . . . as though "
all happiness had gone from the wo
rld . . . and I remembered . . . 
dreadful things. . . .” 
Her voice shook and died. 
Madam Bones’ eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks 
under her eyebrow where the 
monocle had dug into it. 
“What did the dementors do?” she as
"ked, and Harry felt a rush of "
hope. 
"“They went for the boys,” said Mr"
"s. Figg, her voice stronger and "
"more confident now, the pink flus"
h ebbing away from her face. “One 
"of them had fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the "
dementor. That was Harry. He tried 
twice and produced silver vapor. 
"On the third attempt, he produce"
"d a Patronus, which charged down "
"the first dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased away the "
second from his cousin. And that . 
". . that was what happened,” Mrs. "
"Figg finished, somewhat lamely. "
Madam Bones looked down 
at Mrs. Figg in silence; Fudge was not 
"looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally he raised his "
"eyes and said, rather aggressively"
" “That’s what you saw, is it?” "
"“That was what happened,” Mrs. Figg repeated. "
"“Very well,” said Fudge. “You may go.” "
Mrs. Figg cast a frightened look
" from Fudge to Dumbledore, then "
got up and shuffled off toward th
e door again. Harry heard it thud 
shut behind her. 
"“Not a very convincing witness,” said Fudge loftily. "
"“Oh, I don’t know,” said Madam Bo"
nes in her booming voice. “She 
certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately. 
And I can’t imagine why she would 
say they were 
there if they 
weren’t —” 
“But dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just 
happening
 146 to come across a wizard?” snorted Fu
dge. “The odds on that must be 
"very, very long, even Bagman wouldn’t have bet —” "
"“Oh, I don’t think any of us beli"
eve the dementors were there by 
"coincidence,” said Dumbledore lightly. "
The witch sitting to the right of Fudge with her face in shadow 
"moved slightly, but everyone else was quite still and silent. "
“And what is that supposed to mean?” asked Fudge icily. 
“It means that I think they were 
"ordered there,” sa"
id Dumbledore. 
“I think we might have a record of
 it if someone had ordered a pair 
of dementors to go strolling throug
h Little Whinging!” barked Fudge. 
“Not if the dementors 
are taking orders from
 someone other than 
"the Ministry of Magic these days,”"
 said Dumbledore calmly. “I have 
already given you my views on
" this matter, Cornelius.” "
"“Yes, you have,” said Fudge forcefull"
"y, “and I have no reason to be-"
lieve that your views are anything 
"other than bilge, Dumbledore. The "
dementors remain in place in Az
kaban and are doing everything we 
ask them to.” 
"“Then,” said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, “we must ask our-"
selves why somebody within the Mini
stry ordered a pair of dementors 
into that alleyway on 
the second of August.” 
In the complete silence that greet
"ed these words, the witch to the "
right of Fudge leaned forward so th
at Harry saw her for the first time. 
He thought she looked just like a 
"large, pale toad. She was rather "
"squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon, and a "
"very wide, slack mouth. Her eyes we"
"re large, round, and slightly "
bulging. Even the little 
black velvet bow perche
d on top of her short 
curly hair put him in mind of a la
rge fly she was about to catch on a 
long sticky tongue. 
“The Chair recognizes Dolores Ja
"ne Umbridge, Senior Undersecre-"
tary to the Minist
"er,” said Fudge. "
"The witch spoke in a fluttery, girl"
"ish, high-pitched voice that took "
Harry aback; he had be
en expecting a croak. 
   147 “I’m sure I must have misunder
"stood you, Professor Dumbledore,” "
"she said with a simper that left her big, round eyes as cold as ever. “So "
silly of me. But it sounded for a teen
sy moment as thou
gh you were sug-
gesting that the Ministry of Magic ha
d ordered an attack on this boy!” 
She gave a silvery laugh that made
 the hairs on the back of Harry’s 
neck stand up. A few other members 
of the Wizengamot laughed with 
her. It could not have been plainer 
that not one of them was really 
amused. 
“If it is true that the dementors ar
e taking orders only from the Min-
"istry of Magic, and it is also true"
 that two dementor
s attacked Harry 
"and his cousin a week ago, then it "
follows logically that somebody at 
"the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,” said Dumbledore po-"
"litely. “Of course, these particular"
 dementors may have been outside 
Ministry control —” 
“There are no dementors outside Ministry control!” snapped 
"Fudge, who had turned brick red. "
Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow. 
“Then undoubtedly the Mi
nistry will be making 
a full inquiry into 
why two dementors were so very fa
r from Azkaban and why they at-
tacked without authorization.” 
“It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does 
"not do, Dumbledore!” snapped Fudg"
"e, now a shade of magenta of "
which Uncle Vernon woul
d have been proud. 
"“Of course it isn’t,” said Dumbledore mildly. “I was merely ex-"
pressing my confidence that this 
matter will not go uninvestigated.” 
"He glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her monocle and "
"stared back at him, frowning slightly. "
“I would remind everybody that th
"e behavior of these dementors, "
if indeed they are not figments of 
"this boy’s imagination, is not the "
subject of this hearing!” said Fudg
e. “We are here to examine Harry 
Potter’s offenses under the Decree fo
r the Reasonable Restriction of 
Underage Sorcery!” 
 148 "“Of course we are,” said Dumble"
"dore, “but the presence of demen-"
tors in that alleyway is highly relevant. Clause seven of the Decree 
states that magic may be used befo
re Muggles in exceptional circum-
"stances, and as those exceptional ci"
rcumstances include situations that 
"threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself, or witches, wizards, or "
Muggles present at the time of the —” 
"“We are familiar with clause seven, thank you very much!” snarled "
Fudge. 
"“Of course you are,” said Dumbledore courteously. “Then we are "
in agreement that Harry’s use of the Patronus Charm in these circum-
stances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it 
describes?” 
"“If there were dementors, which I doubt —” "
“You have heard from an eyewit
"ness,” Dumbledore interrupted. “If "
"you still doubt her truthfulness, call "
"her back, question her again. I am "
sure she would not object.” 
“I — that — not —” blustered Fudg
"e, fiddling with the papers be-"
fore him. “It’s — I want this ov
"er with today,"
 Dumbledore!” 
"“But naturally, you would not "
care how many times you heard 
"from a witness, if the alternative wa"
"s a serious miscarriage of justice,” "
said Dumbledore. 
"“Serious miscarriage, my"
 hat!” said Fudge at the top of his voice. 
“Have you ever bothered to tot up
 the number of cock-and-bull sto-
"ries this boy has come out with, Du"
"mbledore, while trying to cover up "
his flagrant misuse of magic out of
 school? I suppose you’ve forgotten 
the Hover Charm he used three years ago —” 
"“That wasn’t me, it was a house-elf!” said Harry. "
"“YOU SEE?” roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry’s di-"
rection. “A house-elf! In a 
Muggle house! I ask you —” 
“The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts 
"School,” said Dumbledore. “I can summon him here in an instant to "
give evidence if you wish.” 
   149 “I — not — I haven’t got time to 
"listen to house-elves! Anyway, "
that’s not the only — he blew up
" his aunt, for God’s sake!” Fudge "
"shouted, banging his fist"
 on the judge’s bench 
and upsetting a bottle 
of ink. 
"“And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, ac-"
"cepting, I presume, that even the be"
st wizards cannot always control 
"their emotions,” said Dumbledore "
"calmly, as Fudge attempted to "
scrub the ink off his notes. 
“And I haven’t even started on what
 he gets up to
 at school —” 
“— but as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts 
"students for misdemeanors at school, "
Harry’s behavior there is not rel-
"evant to this inquiry,” said Dumbledore, politely as ever, but now "
with a suggestion of cool
ness behind his words. 
“Oho!” said Fudge. “Not our busi
"ness what he does at school, eh? "
You think so?” 
“The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts stu-
"dents, Cornelius, as I reminded yo"
u on the night of the second of 
"August,” said Dumbledore. “Nor doe"
s it have the right to confiscate 
wands until charges have
" been successfully proven, again, as I re-"
minded you on the night of the second of August. In your admirable 
"haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am "
"sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.” "
"“Laws can be changed,” said Fudge savagely. "
"“Of course they can,” said Dumb"
"ledore, inclining his head. “And "
you certainly seem to be
" making many changes,"
" Cornelius. Why, in "
the few short weeks since I was aske
"d to leave the Wizengamot, it has "
already become the practice to hold 
a full criminal trial to deal with a 
simple matter of underage magic!” 
A few of the wizards above them 
shifted uncomfortably in their 
seats. Fudge turned a slightly de
eper shade of puce. The toadlike 
"witch on his right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face "
quite expressionless. 
 150 "“As far as I am aware, however,” "
"Dumbledore continued, “there is "
no law yet in place that
 says this court’s job is to punish Harry for 
every bit of magic he has ever perf
ormed. He has been charged with a 
specific offense and he has presented
 his defense. All he and I can do 
now is to await your verdict.” 
Dumbledore put his fingertips toge
ther again and said no more. 
"Fudge glared at him, evidently incensed. Harry glanced sideways at "
"Dumbledore, seeking reassurance; he "
was not at all sure that Dumble-
dore was right in tellin
"g the Wizengamot, in effec"
"t, that it was about "
time they made a de
"cision. Again, however, Dumbledore seemed "
oblivious to Harry’s attempt to catch 
his eye. He continued to look up 
at the benches where the entire Wi
"zengamot had fallen into urgent, "
whispered conversations. 
Harry looked at his feet. His hear
"t, which seemed to have swollen "
"to an unnatural size, was thumping loudly under his ribs. He had ex-"
pected the hearing to last longer than
 this. He was not at all sure that 
he had made a good impression. He ha
d not really said very much. He 
"ought to have explained more fully about the dementors, about how "
"he had fallen over, about how both"
 he and Dudley had nearly been 
kissed. . . . 
Twice he looked up at Fudge an
"d opened his mouth to speak, but "
his swollen heart was now constricti
ng his air passages and both times 
he merely took a deep breath and looked back at his shoes. 
Then the whispering stopped. Ha
rry wanted to look up at the 
"judges, but found that it was really"
" much, much easier to keep exam-"
ining his laces. 
“Those in favor of clearing the a
ccused of all charges?” said Madam 
Bones’s booming voice. 
Harry’s head jerked upward. There we
"re hands in the air, many of "
them . . . more than half! Breathin
"g very fast, he tried to count, but "
before he could finish Madam Bones 
"had said, “And those in favor of "
conviction?” 
   151 "Fudge raised his hand; so did half a dozen others, including the "
witch on his right and the heavily 
mustached wizard and the frizzy-
haired witch in the second row. 
Fudge glanced around at them al
"l, looking as though there was "
something large stuck in his throat
", then lowered his own hand. He "
took two deep breaths and then sa
"id, in a voice distorted by sup-"
"pressed rage, “Very well, very well"
 . . . cleared of all charges.” 
"“Excellent,” said Dumbledore briskl"
"y, springing to his feet, pulling "
"out his wand, and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish. “Well, I "
must be getting along.
 Good day to you all.” 
"And without looking once at Harry,"
 he swept from the dungeon. 
Dumbledore’s abrupt departure 
took Harry completely by sur-
prise. He remained sitting wher
"e he was in the chained chair, "
struggling with his feelings of sh
ock and relief. The Wizengamot were 
"all getting to their feet, talking, "
and gathering up their papers and 
packing them away. Harry stood up. 
Nobody seemed to be paying 
him the slightest bit of attention ex
cept the toadlike witch on Fudge’s 
"right, who was now gazi"
ng down at him instead of at Dumbledore. Ig-
"noring her, he tried to catch Fudg"
"e’s eye, or Madam Bones’s, wanting "
"to ask whether he was free to go, "
but Fudge seemed quite determined 
"not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones"
 was busy with 
"her briefcase, "
so he took a few tentative steps 
toward the exit and when nobody 
"called him back, broke in"
to a very fast walk. 
He took the last few steps at a 
"run, wrenched open the door, and al-"
"most collided with Mr. Weasley, who was standing right outside, "
looking pale and apprehensive. 
“Dumbledore didn’t say —” 
"“Cleared,” Harry said, pulling the "
"door closed behind him, “of all "
charges!” 
D 
   153 "Beaming, Mr. Weasley seized"
 Harry by the shoulders. 
"“Harry, that’s wonderful! Well, of "
"course, they couldn’t have found "
"you guilty, not on the evidence, but "
"even so, I can’t pretend I wasn’t —” "
"But Mr. Weasley broke off, because the courtroom door had just "
opened again. The Wizeng
amot were filing out. 
"“Merlin’s beard,” said Mr. Weas"
"ley wonderingly, pulling Harry "
"aside to let them all pass, “you were tried by the full court?” "
"“I think so,” said Harry quietly. "
One or two of the passing wizard
s nodded to Harry as they passed 
"and a few, including Madam Bones, "
"said, “Morning, Arthur,” to Mr. "
"Weasley, but most averted their eyes. Cornelius Fudge and the toad-"
like witch were almost the last to
 leave the dungeon. Fudge acted as 
though Mr. Weasley and Harry were pa
"rt of the wall, but again, the "
witch looked almost appraisingly at 
Harry as she passed. Last of all to 
"pass was Percy. Like Fudge, he completely ignored his father and "
Harry; he marched past clutching 
a large roll of parchment and a 
"handful of spare quills, his back rigi"
d and his nose in the air. The lines 
around Mr. Weasley’s mouth tightened 
"slightly, but other than this he "
gave no sign that he ha
d noticed his third son. 
“I’m going to take you 
straight back so you ca
n tell the others the 
"good news,” he said, beckoning Harry "
forward as Percy’s heels disap-
peared up the stairs to the ninth leve
l. I’ll drop you off on the way to 
that toilet in Bethnal 
Green. Come on. . . .” 
“So what will you have to do abou
"t the toilet?” Harry asked, grin-"
ning. Everything suddenly seemed five
 times funnier than usual. It 
"was starting to sink in: He was cleared, "
he was going back to Hogwarts.
"“Oh, it’s a simple enough anti-jinx,” said Mr. Weasley as they "
"mounted the stairs, “but it’s not so much having to repair the damage, "
it’s more the attitude behind th
"e vandalism, Harry. Muggle-baiting "
"might strike some wizards as funny,"
 but it’s an expression of some-
thing much deeper and na
"stier, and I for one —” "
Mr. Weasley broke off in mid-sent
ence. They had just reached the 
 154 "ninth-level corridor, and Corneliu"
s Fudge was standing a few feet 
"away from them, talking quietly to "
a tall man with sleek blond hair 
"and a pointed, pale face. "
The second man turned at the sound of their footsteps. He too 
"broke off in mid-conversation, his cold gray eyes narrowed and fixed "
upon Harry’s face. 
"“Well, well, well . . . Patronus Po"
"tter,” said Lucius Malfoy coolly. "
"Harry felt winded, as though he ha"
d just walked into something 
heavy. He had last seen those cool 
gray eyes through slits in a Death 
"Eater’s hood, and last heard that ma"
n’s voice jeering in a dark grave-
yard while Lord Voldem
ort tortured him. He could not believe that 
Lucius Malfoy dared look him in the 
face; he could not believe that he 
"was here, in the Ministry of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talk-"
"ing to him, when Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy "
was a Death Eater. 
"“The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter,” "
"drawled Mr. Malfoy. “Quite astonishing, the way you continue to "
wriggle out of very tight holes. . . . 
"Snakelike,"
 in fact . . .” 
Mr. Weasley gripped Harry’
s shoulder in warning. 
"“Yeah,” said Harry, “yeah, I’m good at escaping. . . .” "
Lucius Malfoy raised his ey
es to Mr. Weasley’s face. 
“And Arthur Weasley too! What
 are you doing 
"here, Arthur?” "
"“I work here,” said Mr. Weasley shortly. "
“Not 
"here,"
" surely?” said Mr. Malfoy, raising his eyebrows and glanc-"
ing toward the door over Mr. Weasle
y’s shoulder. “I thought you were 
up on the second floor. . . . Don’
t you do something that involves 
sneaking Muggle artifacts ho
me and bewitching them?” 
"“No,” said Mr. Weasley curtly, hi"
s fingers now biting into Harry’s 
shoulder. 
“What are 
you
 doing here anyway?” Harry asked Lucius Malfoy. 
“I don’t think private matters be
tween myself and the Minister are 
"any concern of yours, Potter,” said"
" Malfoy, smoothing the front of his "
   155 robes; Harry distinctly 
heard the gentle clinking
 of what sounded like 
"a full pocket of gold. “Really, ju"
st because you are Dumbledore’s fa-
"vorite boy, you must not expect the "
same indulgence from the rest of 
us. . . . Shall we go up to 
"your office, th"
"en, Minister?” "
"“Certainly,” said Fudge, turning his back on Harry and Mr. "
"Weasley. “This way, Lucius.” "
"They strode off together, talking "
in low voices. Mr
. Weasley did not 
let go of Harry’s shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift. 
“Why wasn’t he waiting outside Fudge’s office if they’ve got busi-
ness to do together?” Harry burst ou
t furiously. “What was he doing 
down here?” 
“Trying to sneak down to the cour
"troom, if you ask me,” said Mr. "
"Weasley, looking extremely agitated as"
 he glanced over 
his shoulder as 
though making sure they could not be overheard. “Trying to find out 
whether you’d been expelled or not.
 I’ll leave a note for Dumbledore 
"when I drop you off, he ought to know Malfoy’s been talking to Fudge "
again.” 
“What private busine
ss have they got together anyway?” 
"“Gold, I expect,” said Mr. Weasle"
y angrily. “Malfoy’s been giving 
generously to all sorts of things for 
years. . . . Gets him in with the 
right people . . . then he 
can ask favors . . . delay laws he doesn’t want 
"passed . . . Oh, he’s "
"very well connected, Lu"
cius Malfoy. . . .” 
The lift arrived; it was empty ex
cept for a flock of memos that 
flapped around Mr. Weasley’s head as he pressed the button for the 
Atrium and the doors clanged shut; 
he waved them aw
ay irritably. 
"“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry slowly"
", “if Fudge is meeting Death "
"Eaters like Malfoy, if he’s seeing"
" them alone, how do we know they "
haven’t put the Imperi
us Curse on him?” 
“Don’t think it hadn’t occurre
"d to us, Harry,” muttered Mr. "
Weasley. “But Dumbledore thinks Fu
dge is acting of his own accord 
"at the moment — which, as Dumbledor"
"e says, is not a lot of comfort. "
. . . Best not talk ab
out it anymore just 
"now, Harry. . . .” "
 156 The doors slid open and they ste
pped out into the now almost-
deserted Atrium. Eric the secu
rity man was hidden behind his 
Daily 
Prophet
 again. They had walked straig
ht past the golden fountain be-
fore Harry remembered. 
“Wait. . . .” he told Mr. Weasle
"y, and pulling his money bag from "
"his pocket, he turned "
back to the fountain. 
He looked up into the handsome wi
"zard’s face, but up close, Harry "
thought he looked rather weak an
d foolish. The witch was wearing a 
vapid smile like a beauty contesta
"nt, and from what Harry knew of "
"goblins and centaurs, they were most "
unlikely to be caught staring this 
soppily at humans of any description. Only the house-elf’s attitude of 
creeping servility looked convincing
. With a grin at the thought of 
what Hermione would say if she coul
"d see the statue of the elf, Harry "
turned his money bag upside down and emptied not just ten 
"Galleons, but the whole contents into the pool at the statues’ feet. "
"“I knew it!” yelled Ron, punching th"
e air. “You always get away with 
stuff!” 
"“They were bound to clear you,” "
"said Hermione, who had looked "
positively faint with anxiety wh
en Harry had entered the kitchen and 
was now holding a shaking hand over
 her eyes. “There was no case 
"against you, none "
at all. . . .” 
"“Everyone seems quite relieved, thou"
"gh, considering they all knew "
"I’d get off,” said Harry, smiling. "
Mrs. Weasley was wiping her face 
"on her apron, and Fred, George, "
and Ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went “
He 
"got off, he got off, he got off"
 —” 
"“That’s enough, settle down!” shouted Mr. Weasley, though he too "
"was smiling. “Listen, Sirius, Luci"
us Malfoy was at the Ministry —” 
“What?” said Sirius sharply. 
“
"He got off, he got off, he got off"
 —” 
"“Be quiet, you three! Yes, we saw him talking to Fudge on level "
   157 "nine, then they went up to Fudge’"
s office together. Dumbledore ought 
to know.” 
"“Absolutely,” said Sirius. “We’"
"ll tell him, "
don’t worry.” 
"“Well, I’d better get going, ther"
e’s a vomiting toilet in Bethnal 
"Green waiting for me. Molly, I’ll be la"
"te, I’m covering for Tonks, but "
Kingsley might be droppi
ng in for dinner —” 
“
"He got off, he got off, he got off"
 —” 
"“That’s enough — Fred — George — Ginny!” said Mrs. Weasley, "
as Mr. Weasley left the kitchen. “H
"arry dear, come and sit down, have "
"some lunch, you hardly "
ate breakfast. . . .” 
Ron and Hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking 
happier than they had done since 
he had first arrived at number 
"twelve, Grimmauld Place, and Harry’"
s feeling of giddy
" relief, which "
had been somewhat dented by hi
"s encounter with Lucius Malfoy, "
swelled again. The gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcom-
ing all of a sudden; even Kreacher l
ooked less ugly 
as he poked his 
snoutlike nose into the kitchen to 
investigate the source of all the 
noise. 
"“’Course, once Dumbledore turned "
"up on your side, there was no "
way they were going to convict yo
"u,” said Ron happily, now dishing "
great mounds of mashed potatoes onto everyone’s plates. 
"“Yeah, he swung it for me,” said "
Harry. He felt that it would sound 
"highly ungrateful, not to mention childi"
"sh, to say, “I wish he’d talked "
"to me, though. Or even "
looked
 at me.” 
"And as he thought this, the scar on his forehead burned so badly "
that he clapped 
his hand to it. 
“What’s up?” said Herm
"ione, looking alarmed. "
"“Scar,” Harry mumbled. “But it’s nothing. . . . It happens all the "
time now. . . .” 
None of the others had noticed a th
ing; all of them were now help-
ing themselves to food while gloa
ting over Harry’s narrow escape; 
"Fred, George, and Ginny were still "
singing. Hermione looked rather 
 158 "anxious, but before she could say an"
"ything, Ron said happily, “I bet "
"Dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us, you know.” "
"“I don’t think he’ll be able to, Ro"
"n,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting a "
huge plate of roast chicken down in 
front of Harry. “He’s really very 
busy at the moment.” 
“
"HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF"
 —” 
“SHUT UP!” roared Mrs. Weasley. 
Over the next few days Harry could 
not help noticing that there was 
one person within number twelve
", Grimmauld Place, who did not "
seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to Hogwarts. Sir-
ius had put up a very good show of
 happiness on first hearing the 
"news, wringing Harry’s hand and beam"
ing just like the rest of them; 
"soon, however, he was moodier and su"
"rlier than before, talking less to "
"everybody, even Harry, and spending in"
creasing amounts 
of time shut 
up in his mother’s 
room with Buckbeak. 
“Don’t you go feeling guilty!” said
" Hermione sternly, after Harry "
had confided some of his feelin
gs to her and Ron while they 
scrubbed out a moldy cupboard on 
the third floor a few days later. 
"“You belong at Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he’s "
being selfish.” 
"“That’s a bit harsh, Hermione,” "
"said Ron, frowning as he at-"
tempted to prize off a bit of mold that
 had attached itself firmly to his 
"finger, “you wouldn’t want to be"
 stuck inside this house without 
company.” 
“He’ll have company!” said Herm
ione. “It’s headquarters to the 
"Order of the Phoenix, isn’t it? He just got his hopes up that Harry "
would be coming to live here with him.” 
"“I don’t think that’s true,” said "
"Harry, wringing out his cloth. “He "
wouldn’t give me a straight answ
er when I asked him if I could.” 
“He just didn’t want 
"to get his own hopes up even more,” said "
Hermione wisely. “And he probably 
felt a bit guilty hi
"mself, because I "
   159 think a part of him was really ho
ping you’d be expelled. Then you’d 
both be outcasts together.” 
"“Come off it!” said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely "
shrugged. 
“Suit yourselves. But I sometimes 
"think Ron’s mum’s right, and Sir-"
ius gets confused about whether yo
"u’re you or your father, Harry.” "
“So you think he’s touched in the head?” said Harry heatedly. 
"“No, I just think he’s been very"
" lonely for a long time,” said "
Hermione simply. 
At this point Mrs. Weasley en
tered the bedroom
 behind them. 
"“Still not finished?” she said, poking her head into the cupboard. "
“I thought you might be here to te
ll us to have a 
break!” said Ron 
bitterly. “D’you know how much mo
ld we’ve got rid of since we ar-
rived here?” 
“You were so keen to help the Orde
"r,” said Mrs. Weasley, “you can "
do your bit by making headqu
arters fit to live in.” 
“I feel like a house-
"elf,” grumbled Ron. "
"“Well, now that you understand what dreadful lives they lead, per-"
haps you’ll be a bit more active in 
S.P.E.W.!” said He
"rmione hopefully, "
as Mrs. Weasley left them to it ag
"ain. “You know, maybe it wouldn’t "
be a bad idea to show people exactly 
how horrible it is to clean all the 
time — we could do a sponsored sc
"rub of Gryffindor common room, "
"all proceeds to S.P.E.W., it would raise awareness as well as funds —” "
“I’ll sponsor you to shut up about 
"spew,"
"” Ron muttered irritably, "
but only so Harry 
could hear him. 
Harry found himself daydreaming ab
out Hogwarts more and more 
as the end of the holidays approached
; he could not wait to see Hagrid 
"again, to play Quidditch, even to "
stroll across the vegetable patches to 
the Herbology greenhouses. It would be 
"a treat just to leave this dusty, "
"musty house, where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and "
"Kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed, though "
Harry was careful not to say any of
 this within ea
rshot of Sirius. 
 160 The fact was that living
 at the headquarters of the anti-Voldemort 
movement was not nearly
 as interesting or ex
citing as Harry would 
have expected before he’d experien
ced it. Though members of the Or-
"der of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for "
"meals, sometimes only for a few "
"minutes’ whispered conversation, "
Mrs. Weasley made sure that Harry 
and the others were kept well out 
of earshot (whether Extendable or
" normal) and nobody, not even Sir-"
"ius, seemed to feel that Harry needed"
 to know anything more than he 
had heard on the night of his arrival. 
On the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hed-
wig’s owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered 
their bedroom carrying a 
couple of envelopes. 
"“Booklists have arrived,” he said, throwing one of the envelopes up "
"to Harry, who was standing on a chai"
"r. “About time, I thought they’d "
"forgotten, they "
usually come much earl
ier than this. . . .” 
Harry swept the last of the droppi
ngs into a rubbish bag and threw 
the bag over Ron’s head into the 
"wastepaper basket in the corner, "
which swallowed it and belched loud
ly. He then opened his letter: It 
"contained two pieces of parchment, "
one the usual reminder that term 
"started on the first of September, "
the other telling him
 which books he 
would need for the coming year. 
"“Only two new ones,” he said, reading the list. "
“The Standard Book 
"of Spells, Grade 5, "
by Miranda Goshawk and 
"Defensive Magical Theory,"
by Wilbert Slinkhard.” 
Crack.
Fred and George Apparated right be
side Harry. He was so used to 
them doing this by no
w that he didn’t even
 fall off his chair. 
"“We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book,” said "
Fred conversationally. 
“Because it means Dumbledore’s found a new Defense Against the 
"Dark Arts teacher,” said George. "
   161 "“And about time too,” said Fred. "
“What d’you mean?” 
"Harry asked, jumpin"
g down beside them. 
"“Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears "
"a few weeks back,” Fred told Harry, “and from what they were saying, "
Dumbledore was having real trouble 
finding anyone to do the job this 
year.” 
"“Not surprising, is it, when you look"
 at what’s happened to the last 
four?” said George. 
"“One sacked, one dead, one’s memory removed, and one locked in "
"a trunk for nine months,” said Har"
"ry, counting them off on his fin-"
"gers. “Yeah, I see "
what you mean.” 
"“What’s up with you, Ron?” asked Fred. "
Ron did not answer. Harry looked around. Ron was standing very 
"still with his mouth slightly open, "
gaping at his letter from Hogwarts. 
“What’s the matter?” said Fred impa
"tiently, moving around Ron to "
look over his shoulder at the parchment. 
Fred’s mouth fell open too. 
"“Prefect?” he said, staring in"
credulously at 
the letter. “
Prefect
?” 
"George leapt forward, seized the "
"envelope in Ron’s other hand, and "
turned it upside down. Harry saw some
thing scarlet and gold fall into 
George’s palm. 
"“No way,” said George in a hushed voice. "
"“There’s been a mistake,” said Fr"
"ed, snatching the letter out of "
Ron’s grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a wa-
termark. “No one in their right mind
 would make Ron a prefect. . . .” 
The twins’ heads turned in unison and both of them stared at 
Harry. 
“We thought you were a cert!” said Fred in a tone that suggested 
Harry had tricked them in some way. 
“We thought Dumbledore was 
bound
 to pick you!” said George 
indignantly. 
 162 “Winning the Triwizard and everything!” said Fred. 
“I suppose all the mad stuff must
"’ve counted against him,” said "
George to Fred. 
"“Yeah,” said Fred slowly. “Yeah, "
"you’ve caused too much trouble, "
"mate. Well, at least one of you’"
s got their priorities right.” 
He strode over to Harry and clap
ped him on the back while giving 
Ron a scathing look. 
“
Prefect
 . . . ickle Ronnie 
the prefect . . .” 
"“Oh, Mum’s going to be revoltin"
"g,” groaned George, thrusting the "
prefect badge back at Ron as th
ough it might contaminate him. 
"Ron, who still had not said a word, "
"took the badge, stared at it for "
"a moment, and then held it out to "
Harry as though asking mutely for 
confirmation that it wa
s genuine. Harry took it
. A large P was super-
imposed on the Gryffindor lion. He 
had seen a badge just like this on 
Percy’s chest on his very first day at Hogwarts. 
The door banged open. Hermione ca
"me tearing into the room, her "
cheeks flushed and her hair flying. 
There was an envelope in her hand. 
“Did you — did you get — ?” 
She spotted the badge in Harry’s hand and let out a shriek. 
"“I knew it!” she said excitedly,"
" brandishing her letter. “Me too, "
"Harry, me too!” "
"“No,” said Harry quickly, pushing "
the badge back into Ron’s hand. 
"“It’s Ron, not me.” "
“It — what?” 
"“Ron’s prefect, not me,” Harry said. "
“
Ron
"?” said Hermione, her jaw droppi"
ng. “But . . . are you sure? I 
mean —” 
She turned red as Ron looked arou
nd at her with a defiant expres-
sion on his face. 
“It’s my name on th
"e letter,” he said. "
"“I . . .” said Hermione, looking th"
oroughly bewildered. “I . . . well 
". . . wow! Well done, Ro"
n! That’s really —” 
   163 "“Unexpected,” said George, nodding. "
"“No,” said Hermione, blushing harder than ever, “no, it’s not . . . "
Ron’s done loads of . . . he’s really . . .” 
The door behind her opened a little wider and Mrs. Weasley 
backed into the room carrying a 
pile of freshly laundered robes. 
"“Ginny said the booklists had come at last,” she said, glancing "
around at all the envelopes as she 
made her way over to the bed and 
started sorting the robes into two piles. “If you give them to me I’ll 
take them over to Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books 
"while you’re packing. Ron, I’ll have "
"to get you more pajamas, these are "
"at least six inches too short, I can’t believe how fast you’re growing . . . "
what color would you like?” 
“Get him red and gold to match his
" badge,” said George, smirking. "
"“Match his what?” said Mrs. Weasley absently, rolling up a pair of "
maroon socks and placin
g them on Ron’s pile. 
“His 
"badge,"
"” said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over "
quickly. “His lo
vely shiny new 
prefect’s badge.
” 
Fred’s words took a moment to 
penetrate Mrs. Weasley’s preoccu-
pation about pajamas. 
"“His . . . but . . . Ron,"
 you’re not. . . ?” 
Ron held up his badge. 
Mrs. Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermione’s. 
"“I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A "
prefect! That’s everyone in the family!” 
"“What are Fred and I, next-door "
neighbors?” said George indig-
"nantly, as his mother pushed him as"
ide and flung her arms around her 
youngest son. 
"“Wait until your father hears! Ron,"
" I’m so proud of you, what won-"
"derful news, you could end up Head Bo"
"y just like Bill and Percy, it’s "
"the first step! Oh, what a thing to happen in the middle of all this "
"worry, I’m just thrilled, oh "
Ronnie
 —” 
Fred and George were both making loud retching noises behind 
 164 her back but Mrs. Weasley did not 
notice; arms tight around Ron’s 
"neck, she was kissing him all over his face, which had turned a brighter "
scarlet than his badge. 
"“Mum . . . don’t . . . Mum, get a gr"
ip. . . .” he mutte
"red, trying to "
push her away. 
She let go of him and said breathle
"ssly, “Well, what will it be? We "
"gave Percy an owl, but you’ve "
"already got one, of course.” "
"“W-what do you mean?” said Ron,"
 looking as though he did not 
dare believe his ears. 
“You’ve got to have a reward for 
this!” said Mrs. Weasley fondly. 
“How about a nice new 
set of dress robes?” 
"“We’ve already bought him some,” said Fred sourly, who looked as "
though he sincerely regr
etted this generosity. 
"“Or a new cauldron, Charlie’s old "
"one’s rusting through, or a new "
"rat, you always liked Scabbers —” "
"“Mum,” said Ron hopefully, "
“can I have a new broom?” 
Mrs. Weasley’s face fell slightly
; broomsticks were expensive. 
“Not a really good one!” Ron haste
ned to add. “Just — just a new 
one for a change . . .” 
Mrs. Weasley hesita
"ted, then smiled. "
“Of 
course
" you can. . . . Well, I’d better "
get going if I’ve got a broom 
to buy too. I’ll see you all later. . 
". . Little Ronnie, a prefect! And don’t "
forget to pack your trun
ks. . . . A prefect . . . Oh
", I’m all of a dither!” "
She gave Ron yet another kiss on 
"the cheek, sniffed loudly, and bus-"
tled from the room. 
Fred and George 
exchanged looks. 
“You don’t mind if we don’t kiss 
"you, do you, Ron?” said Fred in a "
falsely anxious voice. 
"“We could curtsy, if yo"
"u like,” said George. "
"“Oh, shut up,” said Ro"
"n, scowling at them. "
"“Or what?” said Fred, an evil grin"
 spreading across his face. “Going 
to put us in detention?” 
   165 “I’d love to see him 
"try,” sniggered George. "
"“He could if you don’t watch out!” said Hermione angrily, at which "
"Fred and George burst out laughing and Ron muttered, “Drop it, "
Hermione.” 
“We’re going to have to watch ou
"r step, George,” said Fred, pre-"
"tending to tremble, “with these two on our case. . . .” "
"“Yeah, it looks like our law-breaki"
"ng days are finally over,” said "
"George, shaking his head. "
And with another loud 
"crack,"
 the twins Disapparated. 
“Those two!” said Hermione furiousl
"y, staring up at the ceiling, "
through which they could now hear
 Fred and George roaring with 
laughter in the room upstairs. “Don
’t pay any attentio
"n to them, Ron, "
they’re only jealous!” 
"“I don’t think they are,” said Ron "
"doubtfully, also looking up at the "
ceiling. “They’ve always said only 
"prats become prefects. . . . Still,” he "
added on a happier note
", “they’ve never had new brooms! I wish I "
could go with Mum and choose. . . . 
She’ll never be able to afford a 
"Nimbus, but there’s the new Cleansweep out, that’d be great. . . . "
"Yeah, I think I’ll go and tell her I like the Cleansweep, just so she "
knows. . . .” 
"He dashed from the room, leav"
ing Harry and He
rmione alone. 
"For some reason, Harry found that"
 he did not want to look at 
"Hermione. He turned to his bed, picked up the pile of clean robes "
Mrs. Weasley had laid 
"upon it, and crossed the room to his trunk. "
“Harry?” said Hermione tentatively. 
"“Well done,” said Harry, so heartily"
 it did not sound like his voice 
"at all, and still not looking at "
her. “Brilliant. Prefect. Great.” 
"“Thanks,” said Hermione. “E"
rm — Harry — could I borrow 
Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad?
 They’ll be really pleased — I 
"mean, prefect is something "
they can understand —” 
"“Yeah, no problem,” said Harry, st"
ill in the horrible hearty voice 
that did not belong 
to him. “Take her!” 
 166 "He leaned over his trunk, laid th"
"e robes on the bottom of it, and pre-"
tended to be rummaging for someth
ing while Hermione crossed to the 
wardrobe and called Hedwig down
. A few moments passed; Harry 
heard the door close but remained b
"ent double, listening; the only "
sounds he could hear were
 the blank picture on th
e wall sniggering again 
and the wastepaper basket
 in the corner coughing up the owl droppings. 
He straightened up and looked behind him. Hermione and Hed-
wig had gone. Harry returned slowly 
"to his bed and sank onto it, gaz-"
ing unseeingly at the 
foot of the wardrobe. 
He had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the 
fifth year. He had been too anxious about the possibility of being ex-
pelled to spare a thought for the fa
ct that badges must be winging 
their way toward certain people. But if he 
had
 remembered . . . if he 
had
 thought about it 
. . . what would he have expected? 
"Not this,"
 said a small and truthful
 voice inside his head. 
Harry screwed up his face and buried
 it in his hands. He could not 
lie to himself; if he had known th
"e prefect badge was on its way, he "
"would have expected it to come to him, not Ron. Did this make him "
as arrogant as Draco Malfoy? Did he
 think himself superior to every-
one else? Did he really believe he was 
better
 than Ron? 
"No,"
 said the small voice defiantly. 
"Was that true? Harry wondered, an"
xiously probing his own feelings. 
"I’m better at Quidditch,"
 said the voice. 
But I’m not better at anything 
else.
"That was definitely true, Harry thought; he was no better than Ron "
in lessons. But what about outside lessons? What about those adven-
"tures he, Ron, and Hermione had had "
together since they had started 
"at Hogwarts, often risking mu"
ch worse than expulsion? 
"Well, Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time,"
 said the voice 
in Harry’s head. 
"Not all the time, though, "
Harry argued with himself. 
They didn’t fight
   167 Quirrell with me. They didn’t take on
 Riddle and the basilisk. They didn’t 
get rid of all those dementors the night Sirius escaped. They weren’t in that 
"graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned."
 . . . 
And the same feeling of ill usag
e that had overwhelmed him on 
the night he had arrived rose again. 
I’ve definitely done more
","
Harry 
thought indignantly. 
I’ve done more than either of them
! 
But maybe
", said the small voice fairly, "
maybe Dumbledore doesn’t 
choose prefects because they’ve got themse
lves into a load of dangerous situ-
ations. . . . Maybe he chooses them fo
r other reasons. . . . Ron must have 
something you don’t.
 . . . 
Harry opened his eyes and stared th
rough his fingers at the ward-
"robe’s clawed feet, rememb"
ering what Fred had said. 
“No one in their right mind woul
d make Ron a prefect. . . .” 
Harry gave a small snort of laughter. 
A second later he felt sickened 
with himself. 
Ron had not asked Dumbledore to give him the prefect badge. This 
"was not Ron’s fault. Was he, Harry, "
Ron’s best friend
" in the world, "
going to sulk because he didn’t ha
"ve a badge, laugh with the twins "
"behind Ron’s back, ruin this for Ro"
"n when, for the first time, he had "
beaten Harry at
 something? 
At this point Harry heard Ron’s footsteps on the stairs again. He 
"stood up, straightened his glasses, an"
d hitched a grin onto his face as 
Ron bounded back through the door. 
“Just caught her!” he said happily. “She says she’ll get the Clean-
sweep if she can.” 
"“Cool,” Harry said, and he"
 was relieved to hear
 that his voice had 
stopped sounding hearty. “Liste
"n — Ron — well done, mate.” "
The smile faded off Ron’s face. 
“I never thought it would be me!”
" he said, shaking his head, “I "
thought it would be you!” 
"“Nah, I’ve caused too much trou"
"ble,” Harry said, echoing Fred. "
 168 "“Yeah,” said Ron, “yeah, I suppose"
". . . . Well, we’d better get our "
"trunks packed, "
hadn’t we?” 
It was odd how widely their possessi
ons seemed to have scattered 
themselves since they ha
d arrived. It took them
 most of the afternoon 
to retrieve their books and belong
ings from all over the house and 
stow them back inside their scho
ol trunks. Harry noticed that Ron 
kept moving his prefect’s badge around
", first placing it on his bedside "
"table, then putting it into his jean"
"s pocket, then taking it out and lay-"
"ing it on his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the "
black. Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach 
it to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it 
tenderly in his maroon socks 
and lock it in his trunk. 
Mrs. Weasley returned from Diagon
" Alley around six o’clock, laden "
with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown pa-
per that Ron took from her with a moan of longing. 
"“Never mind unwrapping it now, "
"people are arriving for dinner, I "
"want you all downstairs,” she said"
", but the moment she was out of "
sight Ron ripped off the paper in a 
frenzy and examined every inch of 
"his new broom, an ecstatic"
 expression on his face. 
Down in the basement Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner 
"over the heavily laden dinner table, which read "
congratulations 
ron and hermione — new prefects
. She looked in a better mood 
than Harry had seen her all holiday. 
“I thought we’d have a 
"little party, not a sit-down dinner,” she told "
"Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George"
", and Ginny as th"
ey entered the 
"room. “Your father and Bill are on their way, Ron, I’ve sent them both "
owls and they’re 
"thrilled,"
"” she added, beaming. "
Fred rolled his eyes. 
"Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and Kingsley"
 Shacklebolt were already there 
and Mad-Eye Moody stumped in sh
ortly after Harry had got himself 
a butterbeer. 
"“Oh, Alastor, I am glad you’re here"
",” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, as "
   169 Mad-Eye shrugged off his traveling cl
oak. “We’ve been wanting to ask 
you for ages — could you 
have a look in the writing desk in the draw-
ing room and tell us what’s inside it? We haven’t wanted to open it just 
in case it’s something really nasty.” 
"“No problem, Molly . . .” "
Moody’s electric-blue eye swivel
ed upward and stared fixedly 
through the ceiling 
of the kitchen. 
"“Drawing room . . .” he growled, "
as the pupil contracted. “Desk in 
"the corner? Yeah, I see it. . . . Yeah, it"
’s a boggart. . . . Want me to go 
"up and get rid of it, Molly?” "
"“No, no, I’ll do it myself later,” "
beamed Mrs. Weasley. “You have 
your drink. We’re having a little bit 
"of a celebration, actually. . . .” She "
gestured at the scarlet banner. “Fourt
h prefect in the family!” she said 
"fondly, ruffling Ron’s hair. "
"“Prefect, eh?” growled Moody, his "
normal eye on Ron and his mag-
ical eye swiveling around to gaze into the side of his head. Harry had 
the very uncomfortable feeling it wa
s looking at him and moved away 
toward Sirius and Lupin. 
"“Well, congratulations,"
"” said Moody, still glar"
ing at Ron with his 
"normal eye, “authority figures alwa"
"ys attract trouble, but I suppose "
Dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he 
wouldn’t have appointed you. . . .” 
Ron looked rather startled at this
 view of the matter but was saved 
the trouble of responding by the 
arrival of his father and eldest 
brother. Mrs. Weasley was in su
ch a good mood she did not even 
complain that they had brought Mu
ndungus with them
 too; he was 
wearing a long overcoat that seem
ed oddly lumpy in unlikely places 
and declined the offer to remove it
 and put it with 
Moody’s traveling 
cloak. 
"“Well, I think a toast is in orde"
"r,” said Mr. Weasley, when everyone "
"had a drink. He raised his goblet. “To Ron and Hermione, the new "
Gryffindor prefects!” 
 170 Ron and Hermione beamed as eve
ryone drank to them and then 
applauded. 
"“I was never a prefect myself,” "
said Tonks brightly from behind 
Harry as everybody moved toward th
e table to help themselves to 
food. Her hair was tomato-red and wa
ist length today; she looked like 
Ginny’s older sister. “My Head of 
House said I lacked certain neces-
sary qualities.” 
"“Like what?” said Ginny, who was choosing a baked potato. "
“Like the ability to behave
" myself,” said Tonks. "
Ginny laughed; Hermione looked 
as though she did not know 
whether to smile or not and compro
mised by taking an extra large 
gulp of butterbeer 
and choking on it. 
"“What about you, Sirius?” Ginny asked, thumping Hermione on "
the back. 
"Sirius, who was right beside Harry, "
let out his usual barklike laugh. 
“No one would have made me a pr
"efect, I spent too much time in "
detention with James. Lupin was 
"the good boy, he got the badge.” "
“I think Dumbledore might have hoped that I would be able to ex-
ercise some control over my best fri
"ends,” said Lupin. “I need scarcely "
say that I failed dismally.” 
Harry’s mood suddenly lifted. His fa
ther had not been a prefect ei-
ther. All at once the party seemed 
much more enjoyable; he loaded up 
"his plate, feeling unusually fo"
nd of everyone in the room. 
Ron was rhapsodizing about his 
new broom to anybody who would 
listen. 
"“. . . naught to seventy in ten seconds, not bad, is it? When you "
think the Comet Two Ninety’s only na
ught to sixty and that’s with a 
decent tailwind according to 
Which Broomstick
?” 
Hermione was talking very earnestly 
to Lupin about her view of elf 
rights. 
"“I mean, it’s the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation,  "
   171 isn’t it? It all stems from this horr
ible thing wizards have of thinking 
they’re superior to other creatures. . . .” 
Mrs. Weasley and Bill were having 
their usual argument about Bill’s 
hair. 
"“. . . getting really out of hand, and you’re so good-looking, it "
would look much better shor
"ter, wouldn’t it, Harry?” "
"“Oh — I dunno —” said Harry, slig"
htly alarmed at being asked his 
opinion; he slid away from them in
" the direction of Fred and George, "
who were huddled in a co
rner with Mundungus. 
Mundungus stopped talking when he
" saw Harry, but Fred winked "
and beckoned Harry closer. 
"“It’s okay,” he told Mundungus, "
"“we can trust Harry, he’s our fi-"
nancial backer.” 
"“Look what Dung’s gotten us,” sa"
"id George, holding out his hand "
to Harry. It was full of what look
ed like shriveled black pods. A faint 
rattling noise was coming from th
"em, even though they were com-"
pletely stationary. 
"“Venomous Tentacula seeds,” said"
 George. “We need them for the 
Skiving Snackboxes but they’re a Cl
ass C Non-Tradeable Substance so 
we’ve been having a bit of tr
ouble getting hold of them.” 
"“Ten Galleons the lot, then, Dung?” said Fred. "
“Wiv all the trouble I went to to
" get ’em?” said Mundungus, his "
"saggy, bloodshot eyes stretching ev"
"en wider. “I’m sorry, lads, but I’m "
not taking a Knut
 under twenty.” 
“Dung likes his li
"ttle joke,” Fred said to Harry. "
"“Yeah, his best one so far has be"
en six Sickles for a bag of knarl 
"quills,” said George. "
"“Be careful,” Harry wa"
rned them quietly. 
"“What?” said Fred. “Mum’s busy cooing over Prefect Ron, we’re "
okay.” 
“But Moody could have
" his eye on you,” Harry pointed out. "
 172 Mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder. 
"“Good point, that,” he grunted. “All"
" right, lads, ten it is, if you’ll "
take ’em quick.” 
"“Cheers, Harry!” said Fred deli"
"ghtedly, when Mundungus had "
emptied his pockets into the twins’
 outstretched hands and scuttled 
off toward the food. “We’d bett
er get these upstairs. . . .” 
"Harry watched them go, feeling slig"
htly uneasy. It had just oc-
curred to him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would want to know how 
"Fred and George were financing their joke shop business when, as was "
"inevitable, they finally found out "
about it. Giving the twins his Tri-
"wizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but "
what if it led to another family 
row and a Percy-like estrangement? 
Would Mrs. Weasley still feel that 
Harry was as good as her son if she 
found out he had made it possible fo
r Fred and George to start a ca-
reer she thought quite unsuitable? 
Standing where the twins had left
 him with nothing but a guilty 
weight in the pit of his stomach 
"for company, Harry caught the sound "
of his own name. Kingsley Shackleb
olt’s deep voice 
was audible even 
over the surrounding chatter. 
“. . . why Dumbledore didn’t make Potter a prefect?” said Kingsley. 
“He’ll have had his re
"asons,” replied Lupin. "
“But it would’ve show
"n confidence in him. It’s what I’d’ve done,” "
"persisted Kingsley, “’specially with the "
Daily Prophet
 having a go at 
him every few days. . . .” 
Harry did not look around; he did 
not want Lupin or Kingsley to 
know he had heard. He followed 
"Mundungus back toward the table, "
though not remotely hungry. His plea
sure in the party had evaporated 
as quickly as it had come; he wi
shed he were upstairs in bed. 
Mad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a 
chicken leg with what remained 
of his nose; evidently he could not 
"detect any trace of poison, because "
he then tore a strip of
f it with his teeth. 
   173 “. . . the handle’s made of Span
ish oak with anti-jinx varnish and 
in-built vibration control —” Ron was saying to Tonks. 
Mrs. Weasley yawned widely. 
"“Well, I think I’ll sort out that boggart before I turn in. . . . Arthur, "
"I don’t want this lot up too late, all right? ’Night, Harry, dear.” "
She left the kitchen. Harry se
t down his plate and wondered 
whether he could follow her wi
thout attracting attention. 
"“You all right, Po"
tter?” grunted Moody. 
"“Yeah, fine,” lied Harry. "
Moody took a swig from 
"his hip flask, his elec"
tric blue eye staring 
sideways at Harry. 
"“Come here, I’ve got something that might interest you,” he said. "
From an inner pocket of his robes Moody pulled a very tattered old 
Wizarding photograph. 
"“Original Order of the Phoenix,” "
growled Moody. “Found it last 
night when I was looking for my spar
"e Invisibility Cloak, seeing as "
Podmore hasn’t had the manners to re
turn my best one. . . . Thought 
people might like
 to see it.” 
Harry took the photograph. A small 
"crowd of people, some waving "
"at him, others lifting their glas"
"ses, looked back up at him. "
"“There’s me,” said Moody unnecessarily, pointing at himself. The "
Moody in the picture was unmistakab
"le, though his hair was slightly "
less gray and his nose wa
"s intact. “And there’s Dumbledore beside me, "
"Dedalus Diggle on the other side . . . That’s Marlene McKinnon, she "
was killed two weeks after this was 
"taken, they got her whole family. "
That’s Frank and Al
ice Longbottom —” 
"Harry’s stomach, already uncomfortabl"
"e, clenched as he looked at "
Alice Longbottom; he k
"new her round, friendly face very well, even "
"though he had never met her, beca"
"use she was the image of her son, "
Neville. 
"“Poor devils,” growled Moody. “B"
etter dead than what happened  
 174 "to them . . . and that’s Emmeline Vance, you’ve met her, and that "
"there’s Lupin, obviously . . . Benjy F"
"enwick, he copped it too, we only "
"ever found bits of him . . . shift aside there,” he added, poking the pic-"
"ture, and the little photographic people edged sideways, so that those "
who were partially obscured 
could move to the front. 
“That’s Edgar Bones . . . brother of
" Amelia Bones, they got him and "
"his family too, he was a great wizard"
" . . . Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he "
"looks young . . . Caradoc Dearborn, va"
"nished six months after this, we "
"never found his body . . . Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the same as "
"ever . . . Elphias Doge, you’ve met him, I’d forgotten he used to wear "
"that stupid hat . . . Gideon Prewett, "
it took five Death Eaters to kill 
"him and his brother Fabian, they fought like heroes . . . budge along, "
budge along . . .” 
The little people in the photogra
"ph jostled among themselves, and "
those hidden right at the 
back appeared at the fo
refront of the picture. 
"“That’s Dumbledore’s brother, Aberfo"
"rth, only time I ever met him, "
strange bloke . . . That’s Dorcas 
"Meadowes, Voldemort killed her per-"
"sonally . . . Sirius, when he still ha"
d short hair . . . and . . . there you 
"go, thought that wo"
uld interest you!” 
Harry’s heart turned over. His moth
er and father were beaming up 
"at him, sitting on either side of"
" a small, watery-eyed man Harry rec-"
ognized at once as Wormtail: He 
was the one who had betrayed their 
whereabouts to Voldemort and so 
helped bring about their deaths. 
“Eh?” said Moody. 
Harry looked up into Moody’s heav
ily scarred and pitted face. Evi-
dently Moody was under the impressi
on he had just given Harry a bit 
of a treat. 
"“Yeah,” said Harry, attempting to grin again. “Er . . . listen, I’ve "
"just remembered, I have"
n’t packed my . . .” 
He was spared the trouble of in
venting an object he had not 
packed; Sirius had just 
"said, “What’s that you’ve got there, Mad-Eye?” "
"and Moody had turned toward him. Harry crossed the kitchen, "
   175 slipped through the door and up the 
stairs before anyone could call 
him back. 
He did not know why he had received such a shock; he had seen his 
"parents’ pictures before, after all, "
and he had met Wormtail . . . but to 
"have them sprung on him like that, "
when he was least expecting it . . . 
"No one would like that, he"
 thought angrily. . . . 
"And then, to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces "
". . . Benjy Fenwick, who "
had been found in bits
", and Gideon Prewett, "
"who had died like a hero, and th"
"e Longbottoms, who had been tor-"
tured into madness . . . all waving
 happily out of the photograph 
"forevermore, not knowing that they"
" were doomed. . . . Well, Moody "
"might find that interesting . . . he, Harry, found it disturbing. . . . "
Harry tiptoed up the stairs in the 
"hall past the stuffed elf heads, "
"glad to be on his own again, but as"
 he approached the first landing he 
heard noises. Someone was sobbing in the drawing room. 
“Hello?” Harry said. 
There was no answer but the sobb
ing continued. He climbed the 
"remaining stairs two at a time, wa"
"lked across the landing, and opened "
the drawing-room door. 
Someone was cowering against th
"e dark wall, her wand in her "
"hand, her whole body shaking with "
sobs. Sprawled on the dusty old 
carpet in a patch of moonli
"ght, clearly dead, was Ron. "
All the air seemed to vanish from Harry’s lungs; he felt as though he 
were falling through the floor; his 
"brain turned icy cold — Ron dead, "
"no, it couldn’t be — "
"But wait a moment, it "
couldn’t
 be — Ron was downstairs — 
“Mrs. Weasley?” 
Harry croaked. 
“
R-r-riddikulus
"!’’ Mrs. Weasley sobbed, po"
inting her shaking wand 
at Ron’s body. 
Crack.
"Ron’s body turned into Bill’s, spread-eagled on his back, his eyes "
wide open and empty. Mrs. Weas
ley sobbed harder than ever. 
 176 “
R-riddikulus
!” she sobbed again. 
Crack.
"Mr. Weasley’s body replaced Bill’s,"
" his glasses askew, a trickle of "
blood running down his face. 
“No!” Mrs. Weasley moaned. “No . . . 
riddikulus
! 
Riddikulus
! 
RIDDIKULUS
!” 
Crack.
 Dead twins. 
Crack.
 Dead Percy. 
Crack.
 Dead Harry . . . 
"“Mrs. Weasley, just get out of "
"here!” shouted Harry, staring down "
at his own dead body on the 
floor. “Let so
meone else —” 
“What’s going on?” 
Lupin had come running into the r
"oom, closely followed by Sirius, "
with Moody stumping along behind 
them. Lupin looked from Mrs. 
Weasley to the dead Harry on the fl
oor and seemed to understand in 
an instant. Pulling out his own wand
" he said, very firmly and clearly, "
“
Riddikulus
!” 
Harry’s body vanished. A silvery orb 
hung in the air over the spot 
where it had lain. Lupin waved his 
wand once more and the orb van-
ished in a puff of smoke. 
“Oh — oh — oh!” gulped Mrs. 
"Weasley, and she broke into a "
"storm of crying, her "
face in her hands. 
"“Molly,” said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her, “Molly, don’t . . .” "
Next second she was sobbing her 
heart out on Lupin’s shoulder. 
"“Molly, it was just a boggart,” he "
"said soothingly, patting her on the "
head. “Just a stupid boggart . . .” 
“I see them d-d-dead all the time
!” Mrs. Weasley moaned into his 
shoulder. “All the t-t-time! 
I d-d-dream about it . . .” 
"Sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart, pre-"
"tending to be Harry’s body, had la"
"in. Moody was looking at Harry, "
who avoided his gaze. He had a fu
nny feeling Moody’s magical eye 
had followed him all the way out of the kitchen. 
“D-d-don’t tell Arthur
",” Mrs. Weasley was gulping now, mopping  "
   177 her eyes frantically with her cuffs. “I
 d-d-don’t want him to know. . . . 
Being silly . . .” 
Lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose. 
"“Harry, I’m so sorry, what must you "
think of me?” she said shakily. 
“Not even able to get 
rid of a boggart . . .” 
"“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry, trying to smile. "
"“I’m just s-s-so worried,” she said"
", tears spilling out of her eyes "
again. “Half the f-f-family’s in the Orde
"r, it’ll b-b-be a miracle if we all "
come through this. . . . and P-P-Percy’
s not talking to us. . . . What if 
something d-d-dreadful happens 
and we had never m-m-made up? 
And what’s going to happen if Arthur
" and I get killed, who’s g-g-going "
to look after Ron and Ginny?” 
"“Molly, that’s enough,” said Lupin fi"
rmly. “This isn’t like last time. 
"The Order is better prepared, we’ve "
"got a head start, we know what "
Voldemort’s up to —” 
Mrs. Weasley gave a little squeak of
 fright at the sound of the name. 
"“Oh, Molly, come on, it’s about ti"
me you got used to hearing it — 
"look, I can’t promise no one’s goin"
"g to get hurt, nobody can promise "
"that, but we’re much better off than we were last time, you weren’t in "
"the Order then, you don’t understand, last time we were outnumbered "
twenty to one by the Death Eaters an
d they were picking us off one by 
one. . . .” 
Harry thought of the photograph ag
"ain, of his parents’ beaming "
faces. He knew Moody 
was still watching him. 
"“Don’t worry about Percy,” said Siri"
us abruptly. “He’ll come round. 
It’s a matter of time before Voldem
ort moves into the open; once he 
"does, the whole Ministry’s going to "
be begging us to forgive them. 
"And I’m not sure I’ll be accepting their apology,” he added bitterly. "
“And as for who’s going to look
 after Ron and Ginny if you and 
"Arthur died,” said Lupin, smiling slightly, “what do you think we’d "
"do, let them starve?” "
 178 Mrs. Weasley smiled tremulously. 
"“Being silly,” she muttered "
"again, mopping her eyes. "
"But Harry, closing his bedroom door"
 behind him some ten minutes 
"later, could not think Mrs. Weasley si"
lly. He could still see his parents 
beaming up at him from the tatte
red old photograph
", unaware that "
"their lives, like so many of those ar"
"ound them, were drawing to a close. "
The image of the boggart posing as th
e corpse of each member of Mrs. 
Weasley’s family in turn kept
 flashing before his eyes. 
"Without warning, the scar on his forehead seared with pain again "
and his stomach churned horribly. 
"“Cut it out,” he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded "
again. 
"“First sign of madness, talking to"
" your own head,” said a sly voice "
from the empty picture on the wall. 
"Harry ignored it. He felt older than he had ever felt in his life, and "
it seemed extraordinary to him that
 barely an hour ago he had been 
worried about a joke shop and who had gotten a prefect’s badge. 
Harry had a troubled night’s sleep
. His parents wove in and out 
"of his dreams, never speaking; Mrs. Weasley sobbed over "
"Kreacher’s dead body watched by Ron and Hermione, who were wear-"
"ing crowns, and yet again Harry found himself walking down a corri-"
dor ending in a locked door. He 
awoke abruptly with his scar 
prickling to find Ron alread
y dressed and talking to him. 
"“. . . better hurry up, Mum’s going ballistic, she says we’re going to "
miss the train. . . .” 
There was a lot of commotion in th
e house. From what he heard as 
"he dressed at top speed, Harry gather"
ed that Fred and George had be-
witched their trunks to fly downstair
s to save the bother of carrying 
"them, with the result that they ha"
d hurtled straight into Ginny and 
knocked her down two flights of stai
rs into the hall; Mrs. Black and 
Mrs. Weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices. 
“— COULD HAVE DONE HE
"R A SERIOUS INJURY, YOU "
IDIOTS —” 
"“— FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BESMIRCHING THE HOUSE "
OF MY FATHERS —” 
H 
 180 Hermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered just as 
Harry was putting on his trainers; 
Hedwig was swaying on her shoul-
"der, and she was carrying a squirming Crookshanks in her arms. "
“Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig 
back” — the owl fluttered oblig-
ingly over and perched 
on top of her cage — 
“are you ready yet?” 
"“Nearly — Ginny all right?” Harry asked, shoving on his glasses. "
"“Mrs. Weasley’s patched her up,” said Hermione. “But now Mad-"
"Eye’s complaining that we can’t leave unless Sturgis Podmore’s here, "
otherwise the guard wi
ll be one short.” 
“Guard?” said Harry. “We have to 
go to King’s Cross with a guard?” 
“
You
 have to go to King’s Cross 
"with a guard,” Hermione corrected "
him. 
“Why?” said Harry irritably. “I
 thought Voldemort was supposed 
"to be lying low, or are you telling me he’s going to jump out from "
behind a dustbin to 
try and do me in?” 
"“I don’t know, it’s just what"
" Mad-Eye says,” said Hermione "
"distractedly, looking at her watch. "
“But if we don’t leave soon we’re 
definitely going to miss the train. . . .” 
"“WILL YOU LOT GET DOWN HERE NOW, PLEASE!” Mrs. "
Weasley bellowed and Hermione ju
mped as though scalded and 
hurried out of the room. Harry seiz
"ed Hedwig, stuffed her unceremo-"
"niously into her cage, and set off downstairs after Hermione, dragging "
his trunk. 
Mrs. Black’s portrait was howling 
with rage but nobody was both-
ering to close the curtains over her;
 all the noise in the hall was bound 
to rouse her 
again anyway. 
"“Harry, you’re to come with me "
"and Tonks,” shouted Mrs. Weasley "
over the repeated screeches of 
“MUDBLOODS
! 
SCUM
! 
CREATURES 
OF DIRT
"!” “Leave your trunk and your owl, Alastor’s going to deal with "
"the luggage. . . . Oh, for heaven’s "
"sake, Sirius, Dumbledore said no!” "
A bearlike black dog had appeared at Harry’s side as Harry clam- 
   181 bered over the various trunks cluttering the hall to get to Mrs. 
Weasley. 
“Oh honestly . . .” said Mrs. Weas
"ley despairingly, “well, on your "
own head be it!” 
She wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak 
September sunlight. Harry and th
e dog followed her. The door 
slammed behind them and Mrs. Bl
ack’s screeches were cut off 
instantly. 
"“Where’s Tonks?” Harry said, looking around as they went down "
"the stone steps of number twelve, "
which vanished the moment they 
reached the pavement. 
"“She’s waiting for us just up here,”"
 said Mrs. Weasle
"y stiffly, avert-"
ing her eyes from the lollop
ing black dog beside Harry. 
An old woman greeted them on th
e corner. She had tightly curled 
gray hair and wore a purple 
hat shaped like a porkpie. 
"“Wotcher, Harry,” she said, winkin"
"g. “Better hurry up, hadn’t we, "
"Molly?” she added, checking her watch. "
"“I know, I know,” moaned Mrs. "
"Weasley, lengthening her stride, "
“but Mad-Eye wanted to wait for Sturgis. . . . If only Arthur could 
have got us cars from the Ministry
 again . . . but Fudge wouldn’t let 
him borrow so much as an empt
y ink bottle these days. . . . 
How
Muggles can stand travelin
g without magic . . .” 
But the great black dog gave a jo
yful bark and ga
mboled around 
"them, snapping at pigeons, and ch"
asing its own tail. Harry couldn’t 
help laughing. Sirius had been tr
apped inside for a very long time. 
Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips in 
an almost Aunt Petunia-ish way. 
It took them twenty minutes to 
reach King’s Cross by foot and 
nothing more eventful ha
ppened during that time than Sirius scaring 
a couple of cats for Harry’s entert
ainment. Once inside the station 
they lingered casually beside th
e barrier between platforms nine and 
ten until the coast was clea
"r, then each of them "
leaned against it in  
 182 turn and fell easily through onto 
"platform nine and three quarters, "
where the Hogwarts Express stood be
lching sooty steam over a plat-
form packed with departing studen
ts and their families. Harry inhaled 
the familiar smell and felt his spirit
s soar. . . . He was really going 
back. . . . 
"“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, "
staring behind her at the wrought-
"iron arch spanning the platform, "
through which new arrivals would come. 
"“Nice dog, Harry!” called a ta"
ll boy with dreadlocks. 
"“Thanks, Lee,” said Harry, grinni"
"ng, as Sirius wagged his tail "
frantically. 
"“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, so"
"unding relieved, "
“here’s Alastor 
"with the luggage, look . . .” "
A porter’s cap pulled low over 
"his mismatched eyes, Moody came "
limping through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks. 
"“All okay,” he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. “Don’t think "
we were followed. . . .” 
"Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerge"
d onto the platform with Ron 
and Hermione. They had almost 
unloaded Moody’s luggage cart 
"when Fred, George, and Ginn"
y turned up with Lupin. 
“No trouble?” growled Moody. 
"“Nothing,” said Lupin. "
“I’ll still be reportin
"g Sturgis to Dumbledore,"
” said Moody. “That’s 
the second time he’s not turned up 
in a week. Getting as unreliable as 
Mundungus.” 
"“Well, look after yourselves,” said"
" Lupin, shaking hands all round. "
"He reached Harry last and gave him a clap on the shoulder. “You too, "
Harry. Be careful.” 
"“Yeah, keep your head down and "
"your eyes peeled,” said Moody, "
shaking Harry’s hand too. “And don
"’t forget, all of you — careful "
"what you put in writing. If in doubt,"
 don’t put it in a letter at all.” 
   183 "“It’s been great meeting all of you,"
"” said Tonks, hugging Hermione "
"and Ginny. “We’ll see you soon, I expect.” "
A warning whistle sounded; the students still on the platform 
started hurrying 
onto the train. 
"“Quick, quick,” said Mrs. Weasley distractedly, hugging them at ran-"
dom and catching Harry twice. “Write. 
. . . Be good. . . . If you’ve for-
"gotten anything we’ll send it on. . . . Onto the train, now, hurry. . . .” "
"For one brief moment, the great black dog reared onto its hind legs "
"and placed its front paws on Harry’s shoulders, but Mrs. Weasley "
shoved Harry away towa
"rd the train door hissing, “For heaven’s sake "
"act more like a dog, Sirius!” "
“See you!” Harry called out of the 
open window as the train began 
"to move, while Ron, Hermione, and Ginny waved beside him. The "
"figures of Tonks, Lupin, Moody, "
and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley shrank 
rapidly but the black dog was boun
"ding alongside the window, wag-"
ging its tail; blurred people on the 
platform were laughing to see it 
"chasing the train, and then they turned the corner, and Sirius was "
gone. 
"“He shouldn’t have come with us,” said Hermione in a worried "
voice. 
"“Oh lighten up,” said Ron, “he ha"
"sn’t seen daylight for months, "
poor bloke.” 
"“Well,” said Fred, clapping his hands together, “can’t stand around "
"chatting all day, we’ve got business to"
" discuss with Lee. See you later,” "
and he and George di
sappeared down the corridor to the right. 
The train was gathering still more 
"speed, so that the houses outside "
the window flashed pa
st and they swayed where they stood. 
“Shall we go and find a compartm
"ent, then?” Harry asked Ron and "
Hermione. 
Ron and Hermione 
exchanged looks. 
"“Er,” said Ron. "
 184 “We’re — well — Ron and I are su
pposed to go into the prefect 
"carriage,” Hermione said awkwardly. "
Ron wasn’t looking at Harry; he s
eemed to have become intensely 
interested in the finger
nails on his left hand. 
"“Oh,” said Harry. “Right. Fine.” "
"“I don’t think we’ll have to stay there all journey,” said Hermione "
quickly. “Our letters said we just 
get instructions from the Head Boy 
and Girl and then pa
trol the corridors fr
om time to time.” 
"“Fine,” said Harry agai"
"n. “Well, I-I "
"might see you later, then.” "
"“Yeah, definitely,” said Ron, cast"
"ing a shifty, anxious look at Harry. "
"“It’s a pain having to go down there,"
 I’d rather — but we have to — I 
"mean, I’m not enjoying it, I’m not "
"Percy,” he finished defiantly. "
"“I know you’re not,” said Harry and he grinned. But as Hermione "
"and Ron dragged their trunks, Croo"
"kshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon "
off toward the engine end of the tr
"ain, Harry felt an odd sense of loss. "
He had never traveled on the Hogwarts Express without Ron. 
"“Come on,” Ginny told him, “if we "
get a move on we’ll be able to 
save them places.” 
"“Right,” said Harry, picking up He"
dwig’s cage in one hand and the 
handle of his trunk in the other. 
"They struggled off down the corridor, "
peering through the glass-paneled 
doors into the comp
artments they 
"passed, which were already full. Ha"
rry could not help 
noticing that a 
lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of 
them nudged their neighbors and po
inted him out. After he had met 
this behavior in five consecutive 
carriages he remembered that the 
Daily Prophet
 had been telling its reader
s all summer what a lying 
show-off he was. He wondered blea
kly whether the people now star-
ing and whispering be
lieved the stories. 
In the very last carriage they me
"t Neville Longbottom, Harry’s fel-"
"low fifth-year Gryffindor, his round "
face shining with the effort of 
pulling his trunk along and mainta
ining a one-handed grip on his 
"struggling toad, Trevor. "
   185 "“Hi, Harry,” he panted. “Hi, Ginny. . . . Everywhere’s full. . . . I "
can’t find a seat. . . .” 
“What are you talking about?” said
" Ginny, who had squeezed past "
Neville to peer into the compartm
ent behind him. “There’s room in 
"this one, there’s only L"
oony Lovegood in here —” 
Neville mumbled something about 
not wanting to disturb anyone. 
"“Don’t be silly,” said Ginny, laughing, “she’s all right.” "
She slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside it. Harry and 
Neville followed. 
"“Hi, Luna,” said Ginny. “Is it "
okay if we take
 these seats?” 
The girl beside the window look
"ed up. She had straggly, waist-"
"length, dirty-blond hair, very pale"
" eyebrows, and protuberant eyes "
that gave her a permanently surpri
sed look. Harry knew at once why 
Neville had chosen to pass this compartment by. The girl gave off an 
aura of distinct dottiness. Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her 
"wand behind her left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to "
"wear a necklace of butterbeer caps, or that she was reading a magazine "
upside down. Her eyes ranged over Neville and came to rest on Harry. 
She nodded. 
"“Thanks,” said Ginny,"
 smiling at her. 
Harry and Neville stowed the three 
trunks and Hedwig’s cage in 
the luggage rack and sat down. The girl called Luna watched them 
over her upside-down maga
"zine, which was called "
The Quibbler.
 She 
did not seem to need to blink as mu
ch as normal humans. She stared 
"and stared at Harry, who had tak"
en the seat opposite her and now 
wished he had not. 
"“Had a good summer, "
Luna?” Ginny asked. 
"“Yes,” said Luna dreamily, withou"
"t taking her eyes off Harry. “Yes, "
"it was quite enjoyable, you know. "
You’re
" Harry Potter,” she added. "
"“I know I am,” said Harry. "
Neville chuckled. Luna turned he
r pale eyes upon him instead. 
“And I don’t know
 who you are.” 
 186 "“I’m nobody,” said Neville hurriedly. "
"“No you’re not,” said Ginny sharply. “Neville Longbottom — "
Luna Lovegood. Luna
"’s in my year, but in Ravenclaw.” "
“
"Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure,"
” said Luna in a 
singsong voice. 
She raised her upside-down magazi
ne high enough to hide her face 
and fell silent. Harry and Neville look
ed at each other with their eye-
brows raised. Ginny suppressed a giggle. 
"The train rattled onward, speeding them out into open country. It "
"was an odd, unsettled sort of day; "
one moment the carriage was full of 
sunlight and the next they were
 passing beneath ominously gray 
clouds. 
“Guess what I got for my 
birthday?” said Neville. 
“Another Remembrall?” said Harr
"y, remembering the marblelike "
device Neville’s grandmother had sent
 him in an effort to improve his 
abysmal memory. 
"“No,” said Neville, “I could do with"
" one, though, I lost the old one "
"ages ago. . . . No, lo"
ok at this. . . .” 
He dug the hand that was not keep
ing a firm grip on Trevor into 
his schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what ap-
peared to be a small gray cactus in
" a pot, except that it was covered "
with what looked like bo
ils rather th
an spines. 
“
"Mimbulus mimbletonia,"
” he said proudly. 
Harry stared at the thing. It was 
pulsating slightly
", giving it the "
rather sinister look of some diseased internal organ. 
"“It’s really, really rare,” said Neville, beaming. “I don’t know if "
"there’s one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can’t wait to show "
it to Professor Sprout. 
My great-uncle Algie got 
it for me in Assyria. 
I’m going to see if I 
can breed from it.” 
Harry knew that Neville’s favorite
" subject was Herbology, but for "
the life of him he could not see what
 he would want with this stunted 
little plant. 
   187 “Does it — er — do an
ything?” he asked. 
“Loads of stuff!” said Neville proudly. “It’s got an amazing defen-
sive mechanism — hold 
Trevor for me. . . .” 
He dumped the toad into Harry’s 
lap and took a quill from his 
schoolbag. Luna Lovegood’s popping 
eyes appeared over the top of 
"her upside-down magazine again, watching what Neville was doing. "
Neville held the 
Mimbulus mimbletonia
" up to his eyes, his tongue be-"
"tween his teeth, chose his spot, and gave the plant a sharp prod with "
the tip of his quill. 
Liquid squirted from every boil on
" the plant, thick, stinking, dark-"
green jets of it; they hit the ceilin
"g, the windows, and spattered Luna "
"Lovegood’s magazine. Ginny, who had "
flung her arms up in front of 
"her face just in time, merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy "
"green hat, but Harry, whose hands ha"
d been busy preventing the es-
"cape of Trevor, received a face fu"
ll. It smelled like rancid manure. 
"Neville, whose face and torso were "
"also drenched, shook his head to "
get the worst out of his eyes. 
"“S-sorry,” he gasped. “I haven’t trie"
d that before. . . 
. Didn’t realize 
"it would be quite so . . . Don’t worry, though, Stinksap’s not poiso-"
"nous,” he added nervously, as Har"
ry spat a mouthful onto the floor. 
At that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open. 
"“Oh . . . hello, Harry,” said a nervous voice. “Um . . . bad time?” "
Harry wiped the lenses of his gla
sses with his Trevor-free hand. A 
"very pretty girl with long, shiny black hair was standing in the doorway "
"smiling at him: Cho Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch "
team. 
"“Oh . . . hi,” said Harry blankly. "
“Um . . .” said Cho. “Well . . . just thought I’d say hello . . . ’bye 
then.” 
"She closed the door again, rather "
pink in the face
", and departed. "
Harry slumped back in his seat an
d groaned. He would have liked 
Cho to discover him sitting with a 
group of very cool people laughing 
 188 their heads off at a joke he had just
 told; he would not have chosen to 
be sitting with Neville and Loon
"y Lovegood, clutching a toad and "
dripping in Stinksap. 
"“Never mind,” said Ginny bracingl"
"y. “Look, we can get rid of all "
this easily.” She pu
lled out her wand. “
Scourgify
!” 
The Stinksap vanished. 
"“Sorry,” said Neville again, in a small voice. "
Ron and Hermione did not turn up
" for nearly an hour, by which "
"time the food trolley had already gone by. Harry, Ginny, and Neville "
had finished their Pumpkin Pastie
s and were busy swapping Choco-
late Frog cards when the compar
tment door slid open and they 
"walked in, accompanied by Crooksh"
anks and a shrilly hooting Pig-
widgeon in his cage. 
"“I’m starving,” said Ron, stow"
"ing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, "
grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Ha
rry and throwing himself into the 
seat next to him. He ripped open th
"e wrapper, bit off the Frog’s head, "
and leaned back with his eyes closed
 as though he had had a very ex-
hausting morning. 
"“Well, there are two fifth-year "
"prefects from each House,” said "
"Hermione, looking thoroughly disgru"
ntled as she took her seat. “Boy 
and girl from each.” 
“And guess who’s a Slytherin prefect?
"” said Ron, still with his eyes "
closed. 
"“Malfoy,” replied Harry"
" at once, his wors"
t fear confirmed. 
"“’Course,” said Ron bitterly, stuffi"
ng the rest of the Frog into his 
mouth and taking another. 
“And that complete 
cow
" Pansy Parkinson,” said Hermione vicious-"
ly. “How she got to be a prefect when she’s thicker than a concussed 
troll . . .” 
“Who’s Hufflepuff?” Harry asked. 
“Ernie Macmillan an
"d Hannah Abbott,” said Ron thickly. "
   189 "“And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,” said "
Hermione. 
“You went to the Yule Ball with 
"Padma Patil,” said a vague voice. "
Everyone turned to look at Luna
" Lovegood, who was gazing un-"
blinkingly at Ron over the top of 
The Quibbler.
 He swallowed his 
mouthful of Frog. 
"“Yeah, I know I did,” he said, looking mildly surprised. "
"“She didn’t enjoy it very much,” Luna informed him. “She doesn’t "
"think you treated her very well, beca"
use you wouldn’t dance with her. 
"I don’t think I’d have minded,” she "
"added thoughtfully, “I don’t like "
dancing very much.” 
She retreated behind 
The Quibbler
 again. Ron stared at the cover 
with his mouth hanging open for a 
"few seconds, then looked around "
"at Ginny for some kind of explanation, but Ginny had stuffed her "
knuckles in her mouth to stop he
"rself giggling. Ron shook his head, "
"bemused, then checked his watch. "
"“We’re supposed to patrol the corridors every so often,” he told "
"Harry and Neville, “and we can give"
 out punishments if people are 
misbehaving. I can’t wait to get Crab
be and Goyle for something. . . .” 
“You’re not supposed to abuse your
" position, Ron!” said Hermione "
sharply. 
"“Yeah, right, because Malfoy won’t abuse it at all,” said Ron "
sarcastically. 
“So you’re going to descend to his level?” 
"“No, I’m just going to make sure"
 I get his mates before he gets 
mine.” 
"“For heaven’s sake, Ron —” "
"“I’ll make Goyle do lines, it’ll kill"
" him, he hates writing,” said Ron "
happily. He lowered his voice to Goyl
"e’s low grunt and, screwing up his "
face in a look of pained conc
"entration, mimed writing in midair. "
“I
 . . . 
must
 . . . 
not
 . . . 
look
 . . . 
like
 . . . 
a
 . . . 
baboon’s
 . . . 
backside
. . . .” 
 190 "Everyone laughed, but nobody la"
ughed harder than Luna Love-
good. She let out a scream of mirth 
that caused Hedwig to wake up 
and flap her wings indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up into the 
"luggage rack, hissing. She laughed so"
 hard that her magazine slipped 
"out of her grasp, slid down "
"her legs, and onto the floor. "
“That was 
funny
!” 
"Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring "
"at Ron. Utterly nonplussed, he look"
"ed around at the others, who were "
now laughing at the expression on Ron’s face and at the ludicrously 
"prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backward and "
"forward, clutching her sides. "
"“Are you taking the mickey?” said Ron, frowning at her. "
“Baboon’s . . . backside!” sh
"e choked, holding her ribs. "
Everyone else was watching Luna la
"ughing, but Harry, glancing at "
"the magazine on the floor, noticed "
something that made him dive for 
it. Upside down it had been hard to
 tell what the picture on the front 
"was, but Harry now realized it was "
a fairly bad cartoon of Cornelius 
Fudge; Harry only recognized him 
because of the lime-green bowler 
hat. One of Fudge’s hands was cl
enched around a bag of gold; the 
other hand was throttling a go
blin. The cartoon was captioned: 
How 
Far Will Fudge Go to Gain Gringotts? 
Beneath this were listed the titles of
 other articles inside the magazine. 
CORRUPTION IN THE QUIDDITCH LEAGUE: 
How the Tornados Are Taking Control 
SECRETS OF THE ANCIENT RUNES REVEALED 
SIRIUS BLACK: Villain or Victim? 
“Can I have a look at this?” Harry asked Luna eagerly. 
"She nodded, still gazing at Ro"
"n, breathless with laughter. "
   191 Harry opened the magazine and scan
ned the index; until this mo-
ment he had completely forgotten 
the magazine Kingsley had handed 
"Mr. Weasley to give to Sirius, but it"
 must have been this edition of 
The 
Quibbler.
 He found the page and turned
 excitedly to the article. 
This too was illustrated by a ra
"ther bad cartoon; in fact, Harry "
would not have known it was supposed 
to be Sirius if it hadn’t been 
captioned. Sirius was standing on 
a pile of human bones with his 
wand out. The 
headline on th
e article read: 
SIRIUS - Black As He’s Painted? 
Notorious Mass Murderer OR Innocent Singing Sensation? 
Harry had to read this sentence 
several times before he was con-
vinced that he had no
t misunderstood it. Since 
when had Sirius been 
a singing sensation? 
For fourteen years Sirius Black has been believed 
guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent Mug-
gles and one wizard. Black’s audacious escape from 
Azkaban two years ago has 
led to the widest man-
hunt ever conducted by t
he Ministry of Magic. None 
of us has ever questioned that he deserves to be re-
captured and handed back 
to the dementors. 
BUT DOES HE? 
Startling new evidence has recently come to light 
that Sirius Black may not ha
ve committed the crimes 
"for which he was sent to Azkaban. In fact, says Doris "
"Purkiss, of 18 Acanthia Way, Little Norton, Black may "
not even have been present at the killings. 
“What people don’t realize is that Sirius Black is 
"a false name,” says Mrs. Pu"
rkiss. “The man people  
 192 believe to be Sirius Black is actually Stubby Board-
"man, lead singer of the popular singing group The "
"Hobgoblins, who retired from public life after being "
struck in the ear by
 a turnip at a co
ncert in Little Nor-
ton Church Hall near
ly fifteen years 
ago. I recognized 
him the moment I saw his pi
cture in the 
"paper. Now, "
Stubby couldn’t possibly have committed those 
"crimes, because on the da"
y in question he happened 
to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me. I 
have written to the Minist
er of Magic and am expect-
"ing him to give Stubby, alias Sirius, a full pardon any "
day now.” 
Harry finished reading and stared at
 the page in disbelief. Perhaps 
"it was a joke, he thought, perhap"
s the magazine often printed spoof 
items. He flicked back a few page
s and found the piece on Fudge. 
"Cornelius Fudge, th"
"e Minister of Magic, denied that "
he had any plans to take ov
er the running of the Wiz-
"arding Bank, Gringotts, when"
 he was elected Minister 
of Magic five years ago. Fudge has always insisted 
that he wants nothing more than to “cooperate 
peacefully” with the guardians of our gold. 
BUT DOES HE? 
Sources close to the Mini
ster have recently dis-
closed that Fudge’s dearest ambition is to seize 
control of the goblin gold supplies and that he will 
not hesitate to use force if need be. 
"“It wouldn’t be the first time, either,” said a "
Ministry insider. “Cornelius 
"‘Goblin-Crusher’ Fudge, "
that’s what his friends call 
"him, if you could hear him  "
   193 "when he thinks no one’s listening, oh, he’s always "
talking about the goblins 
he’s had done in; he’s had 
"them drowned, he’s had t"
"hem dropped off buildings, "
"he’s had them poisoned, he’s had them cooked in "
pies. . . .” 
Harry did not read any further. Fu
dge might have many faults but 
Harry found it extremely hard to im
agine him ordering goblins to be 
cooked in pies. He flicked through 
the rest of the magazine. Pausing 
every few pages he read an accusation that the Tutshill Tornados were 
winning the Quidditch League by a 
"combination of blackmail, illegal "
"broom-tampering, and torture; an interview with a wizard who "
claimed to have flown to the moon
 on a Cleansweep Six and brought 
back a bag of moon frogs to prove it
"; and an article on ancient runes, "
which at least explained why Luna had been reading 
The Quibbler
 up-
"side down. According to the magazine, if you turned the runes on "
their heads they revealed
 a spell to make your 
enemy’s ears turn into 
"kumquats. In fact, compared to the rest of the articles in "
"The Quibbler,"
the suggestion that Sirius might real
ly be the lead singer of The Hob-
goblins was quite sensible. 
“Anything good in there?” asked Ro
n as Harry closed the magazine. 
"“Of course not,” said Hermione sc"
"athingly, before Harry could an-"
"swer, “"
The Quibbler’s
" rubbish, everyone knows that.” "
"“Excuse me,” said Luna; her voic"
e had suddenly lost its dreamy 
quality. “My father’s the editor.” 
"“I — oh,” said Hermione, looking embarrassed. “Well . . . it’s got "
some interesting . . . I 
"mean, it’s qu"
ite . . .” 
"“I’ll have it back, thank you,” said"
" Luna coldly, and leaning forward "
she snatched it out of Harry’s hands.
 Rifling through it to page fifty-
"seven, she turned it resolutely "
upside down again and disappeared 
"behind it, just as the compartmen"
t door opened for the third time.  
 194 Harry looked around; he had expected
" this, but that did not make the "
sight of Draco Malfoy smirking 
at him from between his cronies 
Crabbe and Goyle any more enjoyable. 
"“What?” he said aggressively, before Malfoy could open his mouth. "
"“Manners, Potter, or I’ll have to"
" give you a detention,” drawled "
"Malfoy, whose sleek blond hair and "
pointed chin were just like his 
"father’s. “You see, I, unlike you,"
" have been made a prefect, which "
"means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.” "
"“Yeah,” said Harry, “but you, unli"
"ke me, are a git, so get out and "
leave us alone.” 
"Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville"
 laughed. Malfoy’s lip curled. 
"“Tell me, how does it feel being se"
"cond-best to Weasley, Potter?” he "
asked. 
"“Shut up, Malfoy,” said Hermione sharply. "
"“I seem to have touched a nerve,” said Malfoy, smirking. “Well, just "
"watch yourself, Potter, because I’ll be "
dogging
 your footsteps in case 
you step out of line.” 
“Get out!” said Herm
"ione, standing up. "
"Sniggering, Malfoy gave Harry a la"
"st malicious look and departed, "
Crabbe and Goyle lumbering in 
his wake. Hermione slammed the 
compartment door behind them and 
"turned to look at Harry, who "
"knew at once that she, like him, had registered what Malfoy had said "
and been just as unnerved by it. 
"“Chuck us another Frog,” said"
" Ron, who had clearly noticed "
nothing. 
Harry could not talk freely in front of Neville and Luna. He ex-
changed another nervous look with 
Hermione and then stared out of 
the window. 
He had thought Sirius coming with
 him to the station was a bit of 
"a laugh, but suddenly it "
"seemed reckless, if no"
t downright dangerous. 
. . . Hermione had been right. . . . 
Sirius should not have come. What 
"if Mr. Malfoy had noticed the black dog and told Draco, what if he "
   195 "had deduced that the Weasleys, "
"Lupin, Tonks, and Moody knew "
where Sirius was hiding? Or had Ma
lfoy’s use of the word “dogging” 
been a coincidence? 
The weather remained undecided as
 they traveled farther and far-
"ther north. Rain spattered the windows in a halfhearted way, then the "
sun put in a feeble appearance before 
clouds drifted over it once more. 
"When darkness fell and lamps came on inside the carriages, Luna "
rolled up 
"The Quibbler,"
" put it carefully away in her bag, and took to "
staring at everyone in the compartment instead. 
Harry was sitting with his forehead pressed against the train win-
"dow, trying to get a first distant "
"glimpse of Hogwarts, but it was a "
moonless night and the rain-s
treaked window was grimy. 
"“We’d better change,” said Herm"
ione at last. She and Ron pinned 
their prefect badges carefully to th
eir chests. Harry saw Ron checking 
how it looked in the black window. 
At last the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket 
up and down it as everybody scramb
led to get their luggage and pets 
"assembled, ready for departure. "
Ron and Hermione were supposed to 
supervise all this; they disappeared
" from the carriage again, leaving "
Harry and the others to look af
ter Crookshanks 
and Pigwidgeon. 
"“I’ll carry that owl, if you like,” said Luna to Harry, reaching out "
for Pigwidgeon as Neville stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket. 
"“Oh — er — thanks,” said Harry, "
handing her the cage and hoist-
ing Hedwig’s more secu
rely into his arms. 
They shuffled out of the compartm
ent feeling the first sting of the 
night air on their faces as they join
ed the crowd in the corridor. Slowly 
they moved toward the doors. Harry could smell the pine trees that 
lined the path down to the lake. He
 stepped down onto the platform 
"and looked around, listening for the fa"
miliar call of “Firs’ years over 
here . . . firs’ years . . .” 
But it did not come. In
stead a quite different 
"voice, a brisk female  "
 196 "one, was calling, “First years line up "
"over here, please! All first years to "
me!” 
A lantern came swinging toward 
Harry and by its light he saw the 
prominent chin and severe haircut 
"of Professor Grubbly-Plank, the "
witch who had taken over Hagrid’s Care of Magical Creatures lessons 
for a while the previous year. 
“Where’s Hagrid?” he said out loud. 
"“I don’t know,” said Ginny, “but "
"we’d better get out of the way, "
we’re blocking the door.” 
“Oh yeah . . .” 
Harry and Ginny became separated as they moved off along the 
platform and out through the statio
"n. Jostled by the crowd, Harry "
squinted through the darkness for a 
glimpse of Hagrid; he had to be 
"here, Harry had been relying on it — seeing Hagrid again had been "
one of the things to which he 
had been looking forward most. But 
there was no sign of him at all. 
"He can’t have left, "
Harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through 
a narrow doorway onto the road outs
ide with the rest of the crowd. 
He’s just got a co
ld or something.
 . . . 
He looked around for Ron or He
"rmione, wanting to know what "
they thought about the reappearance
" of Professor Grubbly-Plank, but "
neither of them was anywhere near 
"him, so he allowed himself to be "
shunted forward onto the dark ra
in-washed road outside Hogsmeade 
station. 
Here stood the hundred or so hors
eless stagecoaches
 that always 
took the students above first year
 up to the castle. Harry glanced 
"quickly at them, turned away "
to keep a lookout for Ron and 
"Hermione, then di"
d a double take. 
The coaches were no longer horsel
ess. There were creatures stand-
ing between the carriage shafts; if he
" had had to give them a name, he "
supposed he would have called them
" horses, though there was some-"
"thing reptilian about them, too. They were completely fleshless, their "
   197 black coats clinging to their skelet
"ons, of which every bone was visi-"
"ble. Their heads were dragonish, an"
d their pupil-less eyes white and 
staring. Wings sprouted from each
" wither — vast, black leathery "
wings that looked as though they
 ought to belong to giant bats. 
Standing still and quiet in the gloo
"m, the creatures looked eerie and "
sinister. Harry could not understand why the coaches were being 
pulled by these horrible horses wh
en they were quite capable of 
moving along by themselves. 
“Where’s Pig?” said Ron’s vo
"ice, right behind Harry. "
"“That Luna girl was carrying him,"
"” said Harry, turning quickly, ea-"
ger to consult Ron about Hagr
id. “Where d’you reckon —” 
"“— Hagrid is? I dunno,” said Ron,"
 sounding worried. “He’d better 
be okay. . . .” 
"A short distance away, Draco Malfoy"
", followed by a small gang of "
"cronies including Crabbe, Goyle, "
"and Pansy Parkinson, was pushing "
some timid-looking second years out 
of the way so that they could get 
a coach to themselves. Seconds late
r Hermione emerged panting from 
the crowd. 
“Malfoy was being absolutely foul to
" a first year back there, I swear "
"I’m going to report him, he’s only had his badge three minutes and he’s "
using it to bully people worse than
 ever. . . . Where’s Crookshanks?” 
"“Ginny’s got him,” said Harry. “There she is. . . .” "
Ginny had just emerged from th
"e crowd, clutching a squirming "
Crookshanks. 
"“Thanks,” said Hermione, relievin"
"g Ginny of the cat. “Come on, "
let’s get a carriage together befo
re they all fi
ll up. . . .” 
“I haven’t got Pig yet!” Ron said
", but Hermione was already head-"
ing off toward the nearest unoccupi
ed coach. Harry remained behind 
with Ron. 
“What 
are
" those things, d’you reckon?”"
" he asked Ron, nodding at "
the horrible horses as the other students surged past them. 
“What things?” 
 198 “Those horse —” 
Luna appeared holding Pigwidgeon’s cage in her arms; the tiny owl 
was twittering exci
tedly as usual. 
"“Here you are,” she said. “He’s a "
"sweet little owl, isn’t he?” "
"“Er . . . yeah . . . He’s all right,” said Ron gruffly. “Well, come on "
"then, let’s get in. . . . what"
" were you saying, Harry?” "
"“I was saying, what are those hors"
"e things?” Harry said, as he, Ron, "
and Luna made for the carriage in
 which Hermione and Ginny were 
already sitting. 
“What horse things?” 
“The horse things pulling the ca
rriages!” said Harry impatiently; 
"they were, after all, about three "
feet from the nearest one; it was 
watching them with empty white ey
"es. Ron, however, gave Harry a "
perplexed look. 
“What are you talking about?” 
“I’m talking about — look!” 
Harry grabbed Ron’s arm and wheeled
 him about so that he was 
face-to-face with the winged horse. 
Ron stared straight at it for a sec-
"ond, then looked "
back at Harry. 
“What am I supposed 
to be looking at?” 
"“At the — there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! It’s "
right there in front —” 
But as Ron continued to look be
"mused, a strange thought occurred "
to Harry. 
“Can’t . . . can’
t you see them?” 
“See 
what
?” 
“Can’t you see what’s 
pulling the carriages?” 
Ron looked seriously alarmed now. 
“Are you feeling al
"l right, Harry?” "
“I . . . yeah . . .” 
Harry felt utterly bewildered. The ho
"rse was there in front of him, "
gleaming solidly in the dim light 
issuing from the station windows 
   199 "behind them, vapor rising from its no"
strils in the chilly night air. Yet 
unless Ron was faking — and it was 
a very feeble joke if he was — 
Ron could not see it at all. 
"“Shall we get in, then?” said Ron "
"uncertainly, looking at Harry as "
though worried about him. 
"“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, go on . . .” "
"“It’s all right,” said "
a dreamy voice from be
side Harry as Ron van-
ished into the coach’s dark interior
. “You’re not going mad or anything. 
I can see them too.” 
"“Can you?” said Harry desperately, turning to Luna. He could see "
the bat-winged horses reflecte
"d in her wide, silvery eyes. "
"“Oh yes,” said Luna, “I’ve been able"
 to see them ever since my first 
day here. They’ve always pulled the ca
rriages. Don’t worr
y. You’re just 
as sane as I am.” 
"Smiling faintly, she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage "
after Ron. Not altogether reas
"sured, Harry followed her. "
Harry did not want to tell the ot
hers that he and Luna were 
"having the same hallucination, if"
" that was what it was, so he "
said nothing about the horses as 
he sat down inside the carriage and 
slammed the door behind him. Neve
"rtheless, he could not help "
watching the silhouettes of the ho
rses moving beyond the window. 
“Did everyone see that Grubbly-Plank woman?” asked Ginny. 
“What’s she doing back
" here? Hagrid can’t have left, can he?” "
"“I’ll be quite glad if he has,” "
said Luna. “He isn’t a very good 
"teacher, is he?” "
"“Yes, he is!” said Harry,"
" Ron, and Ginny angrily. "
Harry glared at Hermione; she clea
"red her throat and quickly said, "
“Erm . . . yes . . 
. he’s very good.” 
"“Well, we think he’s a bit of a "
"joke in Ravenclaw,” said Luna, "
unfazed. 
"“You’ve got a rubbish sense of humor then,” Ron snapped, as the "
wheels below them creaked into motion. 
"Luna did not seem perturbed by Ron’s rudeness; on the contrary,  "
H 
   201 she simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly inter-
esting television program. 
"Rattling and swaying, the carriage"
s moved in convoy up the road. 
When they passed between the tall st
one pillars topped with winged 
boars on either side of the gates 
"to the school grounds, Harry leaned "
forward to try and see whether there 
were any lights 
on in Hagrid’s 
"cabin by the Forbidden Forest, bu"
t the grounds were in complete 
"darkness. Hogwarts Castle, however,"
 loomed ever closer: a towering 
"mass of turrets, jet-black against the dark sky, here and there a window "
blazing fiery bright above them. 
The carriages jingled to a halt near 
the stone steps leading up to the 
oak front doors and Harry got out of the carriage first. He turned 
again to look for lit windows down 
"by the forest, bu"
t there was defi-
nitely no sign of life within Hagrid
"’s cabin. Unwillingly, because he "
"had half hoped they would have vanished, he turned his eyes instead "
"upon the strange, skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night "
"air, their blank white eyes gleaming. "
Harry had once before 
had the experience of 
seeing something that 
"Ron could not, but that had been a "
"reflection in a mirror, something "
much more insubstantial than a 
hundred very solid-looking beasts 
strong enough to pull a fleet of carr
"iages. If Luna was to be believed, "
the beasts had always been there but 
"invisible; why, then, could Harry "
"suddenly see them, and "
why could Ron not? 
“Are you coming or what?”
 said Ron beside him. 
"“Oh . . . yeah,” said Harry quickly,"
 and they joined the crowd hur-
rying up the stone st
eps into the castle. 
The entrance hall was ablaze with
 torches and echoing with foot-
steps as the students crossed the 
flagged stone floor for the double 
"doors to the right, leading to the "
Great Hall and the start-of-term 
feast. 
The four long House tables in the 
Great Hall were fi
lling up under  
 202 "the starless black ceiling, which "
was just like the sky they could 
glimpse through the high windows.
 Candles floated in midair all 
"along the tables, illuminating the "
silvery ghosts who were dotted 
about the Hall and the faces of the 
students talking eagerly to one an-
"other, exchanging summer news, shouting greetings at friends from "
"other Houses, eyeing one another’s new haircuts and robes. Again "
Harry noticed people putting their he
ads together to whisper as he 
passed; he gritted his teeth and trie
d to act as though he neither no-
ticed nor cared. 
Luna drifted away from them at 
the Ravenclaw table. The moment 
"they reached Gryffindor’s, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth "
years and left to sit with them; 
"Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville "
found seats together about halfway down the table between Nearly 
"Headless Nick, the Gryffindor House ghost, and Parvati Patil and "
"Lavender Brown, the last two of"
" whom gave Harry airy, overly "
friendly greetings that made him qu
ite sure they had stopped talking 
about him a split second before. He
 had more important things to 
"worry about, however: He was lookin"
g over the students’ heads to the 
staff table that ran along 
the top wall of the Hall. 
“He’s not there.” 
Ron and Hermione scanned the sta
"ff table too, though there was "
no real need; Hagrid’s size made 
him instantly obviou
s in any lineup. 
"“He can’t have left,”"
" said Ron, sounding slightly anxious. "
"“Of course he hasn’t,” said Harry firmly. "
“You don’t think he’s . . . 
"hurt,"
" or anything, do you?” said Hermione "
uneasily. 
"“No,” said Harry at once. "
"“But where is he, then?” "
"There was a pause, then Harry said "
"very quietly, so that Neville, "
"Parvati, and Lavender could not hear"
", “Maybe he’s not back yet. You "
know — from his mission — the th
ing he was doing over the sum-
mer for Dumbledore.” 
   203 "“Yeah . . . yeah, that’ll be it,” sa"
"id Ron, sounding reassured, but "
"Hermione bit her lip, looking up "
and down the staff table as though 
hoping for some conclusive expl
anation of Hagrid’s absence. 
“Who’s 
that
"?” she said sharply, pointing"
 toward the middle of the 
staff table. 
Harry’s eyes followed hers. They li
t first upon Professor Dumble-
"dore, sitting in his high-backed gold"
en chair at the center of the long 
"staff table, wearing deep"
-purple robes scattered with silvery stars and 
a matching hat. Dumbledore’s head
 was inclined toward the woman 
"sitting next to him, who was talkin"
"g into his ear. She looked, Harry "
"thought, like somebody’s maiden aunt: squat, with short, curly, "
mouse-brown hair in which she had 
placed a horrible pink Alice band 
that matched the fluffy pink cardig
an she wore over her robes. Then 
she turned her face slightly to take
" a sip from her goblet and he saw, "
"with a shock of recognition, a pallid,"
 toadlike face and a pair of promi-
"nent, pouchy eyes. "
“It’s that Umbridge woman!” 
“Who?” said Hermione. 
"“She was at my hearing,"
 she works for Fudge!” 
"“Nice cardigan,” sa"
"id Ron, smirking. "
"“She works for Fudge?” Hermione repeated, frowning. “What on "
"earth’s she doing here, then?” "
“Dunno . . .” 
Hermione scanned the staff 
"table, her eyes narrowed. "
"“No,” she muttered, “no,"
 surely not . . .” 
Harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not 
ask; his attention had just been 
caught by Professor Grubbly-Plank 
who had just appeared behind the staff table; she worked her way 
along to the very end and took the 
seat that ought to have been Ha-
grid’s. That meant that the first years must have crossed the lake and 
"reached the castle, and sure enough, a few seconds later, the doors "
from the entrance hall opened. A long
 line of scared-looking first years 
 204 "entered, led by Professor McGonaga"
"ll, who was carrying a stool on "
"which sat an ancient wizard’s hat, heavily patched and darned with a "
wide rip near the frayed brim. 
The buzz of talk in the Great Hall 
faded away. The first years lined 
up in front of the staff table facing
" the rest of the students, and Pro-"
fessor McGonagall placed the stool 
"carefully in front of them, then "
stood back. 
The first years’ faces glowed palely
 in the candlelight. A small boy 
right in the middle of the row looked as though he was trembling. 
"Harry recalled, fleetingly, how terri"
fied he had felt when he had stood 
"there, waiting for the unknown test"
 that would determine to which 
House he belonged. 
The whole school waited with ba
ted breath. Then the rip near the 
hat’s brim opened wide like a mouth and the Sorting Hat burst into 
song: 
In times of old when I was new 
And Hogwarts barely started 
The founders of our noble school 
Thought never to be parted: 
"United by a common goal, "
"They had the selfsame yearning, "
To make the world’s best magic school 
And pass along their learning. 
“Together we will build and teach!” 
The four good friends decided 
And never did they dream that they 
"Might someday be divided, "
For were there such friends anywhere 
As Slytherin and Gryffndor? 
Unless it was the second pair 
Of Huffepuff and Ravenclaw?
   205 So how could it have gone so wrong?
How could such friendships fail?
"Why, I was there and so can tell"
"The whole sad, sorry tale."
"Said Slytherin, “We’ll teach just those"
Whose ancestry is purest.”
"Said Ravenclaw, “We’ll teach those whose"
Intelligence is surest.”
"Said Gryffindor, “We’ll teach all those"
"With brave deeds to their name,”"
"Said Hufflepujf, “I’ll teach the lot,"
And treat them just the same.”
These differences caused little strife
"When first they came to light,"
For each of the four founders had
A House in which they might
"Take only those they wanted, so,"
"For instance, Slytherin"
Took only pure-blood wizards
"Of great cunning, just like him,"
And only those of sharpest mind
Were taught by Ravenclaw
While the bravest and the boldest
Went to daring Gryffindor.
"Good Hufflepujf she took the rest,"
"And taught them all she knew,"
Thus the Houses and their founders
Retained friendships firm and true.
So Hogwarts worked in harmony
"For several happy years,"
But then discord crept among us
Feeding on our faults and fears.
 206 "The Houses that, like pillars four, "
"Had once held up our school, "
"Now turned upon each other and, "
"Divided, sought to rule. "
And for a while it seemed the school 
"Must meet an early end, "
What with dueling and with fighting 
And the clash of friend on friend 
And at last there came a morning 
When old Slytherin departed 
And though the fighting then died out 
He left us quite downhearted. 
And never since the founders four 
Were whittled down to three 
Have the Houses been united 
As they once were meant to be. 
And now the Sorting Hat is here 
And you all know the score: 
I sort you into Houses 
"Because that is what I’m for, "
"But this year I’ll go further, "
Listen closely to my song: 
Though condemned I am to split you 
"Still I worry that it’s wrong, "
Though I must fulfill my duty 
And must quarter every year 
Still I wonder whether sorting 
May not bring the end I fear. 
"Oh, know the perils, read the signs, "
"The warning history shows, "
For our Hogwarts is in danger 
"From external, deadly foes"
   207 And we must unite inside her
Or we’ll crumble from within.
"I have told you, I have warned you. . . ."
Let the Sorting now begin.
"The hat became motionless once more; applause broke out, though "
"it was punctured, for the first ti"
"me in Harry’s memory, with mutter-"
ing and whispers. All across the Great Hall students were exchanging 
remarks with their neighbors and Ha
"rry, clapping along with every-"
"one else, knew exactly what they were talking about. "
"“Branched out a bit this year, hasn"
"’t it?” said Ron, his eyebrows "
raised. 
"“Too right it has,” said Harry. "
The Sorting Hat usually confined it
self to describing the different 
qualities looked for by each of th
e four Hogwarts Houses and its own 
role in sorting them; Harry could not remember it ever trying to give 
the school advice before. 
“I wonder if it’s ever given wa
"rnings before?” said Hermione, "
sounding slightly anxious. 
"“Yes, indeed,” said Nearly Head"
"less Nick knowledgeably, leaning "
across Neville toward her (Neville 
"winced, it was very uncomfortable "
to have a ghost lean through you)
. “The hat feels itself honor-bound 
to give the school due warn
ing whenever it feels —” 
"But Professor McGonagall, who was wa"
iting to read out the list of 
"first years’ names, was giving the w"
hispering students the sort of look 
that scorches. Nearly Headless Nick 
placed a see-through finger to his 
lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt 
end. With a last frowning look that
" swept the four House tables, Pro-"
fessor McGonagall lowered her eyes 
to her long piece of parchment 
"and called out, "
"“Abercrombie, Euan.” "
The terrified-looking boy Harry ha
d noticed earlier stumbled 
 208 forward and put the hat on his he
ad; it was only prevented from 
falling right down to his 
shoulders by his very prominent ears. The hat 
"considered for a moment, then th"
e rip near the brim opened again 
"and shouted, “"
GRYFFINDOR
!” 
Harry clapped loudly with the rest
 of Gryffindor House as Euan 
Abercrombie staggered to their tabl
"e and sat down, looking as though "
he would like very much to sink
 through the floor and never be 
looked at again. 
Slowly the long line of first ye
ars thinned; in th
e pauses between 
the names and the Sorting Hat’s de
"cisions, Harry could hear Ron’s "
"stomach rumbling loudly. Finally, “Z"
"eller, Rose” was sorted into Huf-"
"flepuff, and Professor McGonagall "
picked up the hat and stool and 
marched them away as Professo
r Dumbledore rose to his feet. 
Harry was somehow soothed to s
ee Dumbledore standing before 
"them all, whatever his recent bi"
tter feelings toward his headmaster. 
Between the absence of Hagrid and the presence of those dragonish 
"horses, he had felt that his return to Hogwarts, so long anticipated, "
was full of unexpected surprises like
 jarring notes in a familiar song. 
"But this, at least, was how it was "
supposed to be: their headmaster ris-
ing to greet them all before
 the start-of-term feast. 
"“To our newcomers,” said Dumbledor"
"e in a ringing voice, his arms "
stretched wide and a beaming smile 
"on his lips, “welcome! To our old "
hands — welcome back! There is a ti
"me for speech making, but this is "
not it. Tuck in!” 
There was an appreciative laugh and 
an outbreak of applause as Dum-
bledore sat down neatly and threw his 
long beard over his shoulder so as 
to keep it out of the way of his plate — for food had appeared out of 
"nowhere, so that the five long tables"
 were groaning unde
r joints and pies 
and dishes of vegetables
", bread, sauces, and flag"
ons of pumpkin juice. 
"“Excellent,” said Ron, with a ki"
"nd of groan of longing, and he "
seized the nearest plate of chops and 
"began piling them onto his plate, "
watched wistfully by 
Nearly Headless Nick. 
   209 “What were you saying before th
e Sorting?” Hermione asked the 
ghost. “About the hat giving warnings?” 
"“Oh yes,” said Nick, who seemed glad of a reason to turn away "
"from Ron, who was now eating roas"
t potatoes with almost indecent 
"enthusiasm. “Yes, I have heard the hat give several warnings before, "
always at times when it detects peri
ods of great danger for the school. 
"And always, of course, its advice is "
"the same: Stand together, be strong "
from within.” 
“Ow kunnit nofe skusin da
nger ifzat?” said Ron. 
His mouth was so full Harry though
t it was quite an achievement 
for him to make any noise at all. 
"“I beg your pardon?” said Nearly Headless Nick politely, while "
"Hermione looked revolted. Ron gave an enormous swallow and said, "
“How can it know if the school’s in danger if it’s a hat?” 
"“I have no idea,” said Nearly He"
"adless Nick. “Of course, it lives in "
"Dumbledore’s office, so"
 I daresay it picks 
things up there.” 
“And it wants all the Houses to 
"be friends?” said Harry, looking "
"over at the Slytherin table, wher"
e Draco Malfoy was holding court. 
“Fat chance.” 
"“Well, now, you shouldn’t take that "
"attitude,” said Nick reprovingly. "
"“Peaceful cooperation, that’s the key."
" We ghosts, though we belong to "
"separate Houses, maintain links of "
friendship. In spite of the compet-
itiveness between Gryffindor and Slyt
"herin, I would never dream of "
seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron.” 
“Only because you’re terrif
"ied of him,” said Ron. "
Nearly Headless Nick l
ooked highly affronted. 
"“Terrified? I hope I, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, have never "
been guilty of cowardice in my life
! The noble blood that runs in my 
veins —” 
“What blood?” asked Ron. “Surel
y you haven’t still got — ?” 
“It’s a figure of speech!” said Ne
"arly Headless Nick, now so annoyed "
his head was trembling ominously on his partially severed neck. “I 
 210 assume I am still allowed to enjoy 
the use of whiche
"ver words I like, "
even if the pleasures of eating and 
drinking are denied me! But I am 
quite used to students poking fu
"n at my death, I assure you!” "
"“Nick, he wasn’t really laughing "
"at you!” said Hermione, throwing "
a furious look at Ron. 
"Unfortunately, Ron’s mouth was pa"
cked to exploding point again 
and all he could manage was “n
"ode iddum eentup sechew,” which "
Nick did not seem to think constitu
ted an adequate apology. Rising 
"into the air, he straightened his "
feathered hat and swept away from 
them to the other end of the ta
"ble, coming to rest between the "
"Creevey brothers, Colin and Dennis. "
"“Well done, Ron,” "
snapped Hermione. 
"“What?” said Ron indignantly, havi"
"ng managed, finally, to swallow "
his food. “I’m not allowed to
 ask a simple question?” 
"“Oh forget it,” said Hermione irrita"
"bly, and the pair of them spent "
the rest of the meal
 in huffy silence. 
Harry was too used to their bickerin
g to bother trying to reconcile 
them; he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his way steadily 
"through his steak-and-kidney pie, th"
en a large plateful of his favorite 
treacle tart. 
When all the students had finished 
eating and the noise level in the 
"hall was starting to creep upward again, Dumbledore got to his feet "
once more. Talking ceased immediately as all turned to face the head-
master. Harry was feeling pleasantly drowsy now. His four-poster bed 
"was waiting somewhere above, wo"
nderfully warm 
and soft. . . . 
"“Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg "
a few moments of your attention fo
"r the usual start-of-term notices,” "
said Dumbledore. “First years ought 
to know that the forest in the 
grounds is out of bounds
 to students — and a few of our older students 
"ought to know by now too.” (Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged "
smirks.) 
   211 "“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has aske"
"d me, for what he tells me is the "
"four hundred and sixty-second time, "
to remind you all that magic is 
"not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other "
"things, all of which can be checked "
on the extensive list now fastened 
to Mr. Filch’s office door. 
“We have had two changes in staffing this year. We are very pleased 
"to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of "
Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Profes-
"sor Umbridge, our new Defense Ag"
ainst the Dark 
Arts teacher.” 
There was a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic applause dur-
"ing which Harry, Ron, and Hermio"
ne exchanged slightly panicked 
looks; Dumbledore had not said fo
r how long Grubbly-Plank would 
be teaching. 
"Dumbledore continued, “Tryouts for the House Quidditch teams "
will take place on the —” 
"He broke off, looking inquiringl"
y at Professor Umbridge. As she 
was not much taller standing than 
"sitting, there was a moment when "
nobody understood why Dumbledore 
"had stopped talking, but then "
"Professor Umbridge said, “"
"Hem, hem,"
” and it became clear that she 
had got to her feet and was intending to make a speech. 
Dumbledore only looked taken ab
"ack for a moment, then he sat "
back down smartly and looked aler
tly at Professor Umbridge as 
though he desired nothing better th
an to listen to her talk. Other 
members of staff were not as adept 
at hiding their surprise. Professor 
Sprout’s eyebrows had disappeared 
"into her flyaway hair, and Profes-"
sor McGonagall’s mouth was as thin
 as Harry had ever seen it. No 
new teacher had ever interrupted 
Dumbledore before. Many of the 
students were smirking; this wo
man obviously did not know how 
things were done at Hogwarts. 
"“Thank you, Headmaster,” Professor Umbridge simpered, “for "
those kind words of welcome.” 
 212 "Her voice was high-pitched, breathy,"
" and little-girlish and again, "
Harry felt a powerful rush of dislik
e that he could no
t explain to him-
self; all he knew was that he loat
"hed everything about her, from her "
stupid voice to her fluffy pink card
igan. She gave another little throat-
clearing cough (“
"Hem, hem"
"”) and continued: “Well, it is lovely to be "
"back at Hogwarts, I must say!” "
"She smiled, revealing very pointed "
teeth. “And to see such happy li
ttle faces looking back at me!” 
Harry glanced around. None of th
e faces he could see looked 
"happy; on the contrary, they all l"
ooked rather taken aback at being 
addressed as though they
 were five years old. 
“I am very much looking forward to
" getting to know you all, and "
I’m sure we’ll be 
very good friends!” 
Students exchanged looks at this; 
some of them were barely con-
cealing grins. 
“I’ll be her friend as long as I don
"’t have to borrow that cardigan,” "
"Parvati whispered to Lavender, and bo"
th of them lapsed into silent 
giggles. 
Professor Umbridge clea
red her throat again (“
"Hem, hem"
"”), but "
"when she continued, some of the breathiness had vanished from her "
voice. She sounded much more bu
sinesslike and now her words had a 
dull learned-by-hea
rt sound to them. 
“The Ministry of Magic has always
 considered the education of 
young witches and wizards to be of
 vital importance. The rare gifts 
with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and 
honed by careful instruction. The ancient skills unique to the Wiz-
arding community must be passed 
down through the generations lest 
we lose them forever. The trea
sure trove of magical knowledge 
amassed by our ancestors must be 
"guarded, replenished, and polished "
by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching.” 
Professor Umbridge paused here 
and made a little bow to her 
"fellow staff members, none of whom"
 bowed back. Professor McGona-
gall’s dark eyebrows had contracted
 so that she looked positively 
   213 "hawklike, and Harry distinctly saw he"
r exchange a significant glance 
with Professor Sprout as Umbridge gave another little “
"Hem, hem"
”
and 
went on with her speech. 
“Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought 
"something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school, "
"and that is as it should be, for with"
out progress there will be stagnation 
"and decay. There again, progress fo"
r progress’s sake must be discour-
"aged, for our tried and tested tradit"
ions often require no tinkering. A 
"balance, then, between old and ne"
"w, between permanence and change, "
between tradition and innovation . . .” 
"Harry found his attentiveness ebbing, as though his brain was slip-"
ping in and out of tune. The quiet 
that always fill
ed the Hall when 
Dumbledore was speaking was breaking
 up as students put their heads 
"together, whispering and giggling. Over at the Ravenclaw table, Cho "
Chang was chatting animatedly with
 her friends. A few seats along 
"from Cho, Luna Lovegood had got out "
The Quibbler
 again. Mean-
"while at the Hufflepuff table, Ernie "
Macmillan was one of the few still 
"staring at Professor Umbridge, but "
he was glassy-eyed and Harry was 
sure he was only pretending to list
en in an attempt to live up to the 
new prefect’s badge gleaming on his chest. 
Professor Umbridge did not seem to
 notice the restlessness of her 
audience. Harry had the impression that a full-scale riot could have 
broken out under her nose and she 
would have plowed on with her 
"speech. The teachers, however, were st"
ill listening very 
"attentively, and "
Hermione seemed to be drinking 
"in every word Umbridge spoke, "
"though judging by her expression, they were not at all to her taste. "
“. . . because some chan
ges will be for the bett
"er, while others will "
"come, in the fullness of time, to be "
recognized as erro
rs of judgment. 
"Meanwhile, some old habits will be"
" retained, and rightly so, whereas "
"others, outmoded and outworn, mu"
st be abandoned. Let us move 
"forward, then, into a new era of "
"openness, effectiveness, and account-"
"ability, intent on preserving what "
"ought to be preserved, perfecting "
 214 "what needs to be perfected, and pr"
uning wherever we find practices 
that ought to be prohibited.” 
"She sat down. Dumbledore clapped. The staff followed his lead, "
though Harry noticed that several 
of them brought their hands to-
gether only once or twice before 
"stopping. A few students joined in, "
but most had been take
n unawares by the end 
"of the speech, not hav-"
ing listened to more than a few word
"s of it, and before they could start "
applauding proper
"ly, Dumbledore had "
stood up again. 
"“Thank you very much, Professor Um"
"bridge, that was most illumi-"
"nating,” he said, bowing to her. "
"“Now — as I was saying, Quidditch "
tryouts will be held . . .” 
"“Yes, it certainly was illuminating,”"
 said Hermione in a low voice. 
“You’re not telling me you enjoyed 
"it?” Ron said quietly, turning a "
glazed face upon Hermione. “That 
was about the dullest speech I’ve 
"ever heard, and I grew up with Percy.” "
"“I said illuminating, not enjoyabl"
"e,” said Hermione. “It explained "
a lot.” 
“Did it?” said Harry in surprise. “Sounded like a load of waffle to me.” 
“There was some important stuff 
"hidden in the waffle,” said Her-"
mione grimly. 
“Was there?” said Ron blankly. 
“How about ‘progress for progress’s sake must be discouraged’? How 
about ‘pruning wherever we find prac
tices that ought to be prohibited’?” 
"“Well, what does that mean"
?” said Ron impatiently. 
"“I’ll tell you what it means,” sa"
id Hermione ominously. “It means 
the Ministry’s interf
ering at Hogwarts.” 
There was a great clattering and 
banging all around them; Dumb-
ledore had obviously just
" dismissed the school, because everyone was "
standing up ready to leave the Ha
"ll. Hermione jumped up, looking "
flustered. 
"“Ron, we’re supposed to show "
the first years where to go!” 
   215 "“Oh yeah,” said Ron, who had obviously forgotten. “Hey — hey "
you lot! Midgets!” 
“
Ron
!” 
"“Well, they are, th"
ey’re titchy. . . .” 
"“I know, but you can’t call them mi"
dgets. . . . First years!” Hermione 
called commandingly along the ta
"ble. “This way, please!” "
A group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the 
"Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables, all "
of them trying hard not to lead 
the group. They did indeed seem very small; Harry was sure he had 
not appeared that young when he 
had arrived here. He grinned at 
them. A blond boy next to Euan 
"Abercrombie looked petrified, "
"nudged Euan, and whispered something in his ear. Euan Abercrombie "
looked equally frightened and stole 
"a horrified look at Harry, who felt "
the grin slide off his 
face like Stinksap. 
"“See you later,” he said to Ron and Hermione and he made his way "
out of the Great Hall al
"one, doing everything he "
could to ignore more 
"whispering, staring, and pointing as he passed. He kept his eyes fixed "
ahead as he wove his way through 
"the crowd in the entrance hall, then "
"he hurried up the marble staircase,"
 took a couple of concealed short-
"cuts, and had soon left mo"
st of the crowds behind. 
"He had been stupid not to expect this, he thought angrily, as he "
walked through much emptier upstai
rs corridors. Of course everyone 
was staring at him: He had emer
ged from the Triwizard maze two 
months ago clutching the dead body
 of a fellow student and claiming 
to have seen Lord Voldemort return to power. There had not been 
time last term to explain himself 
"before everyone went home, even if "
he had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the ter-
rible events in that graveyard. 
He had reached the end of the corridor to the Gryffindor common 
room and had come to a halt in fron
t of the portrait of the Fat Lady 
before he realized that he 
did not know the new password. 
 216 "“Er . . .” he said glumly, starin"
"g up at the Fat Lady, who smoothed "
the folds of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at him. 
"“No password, no entrance,” she said loftily. "
"“Harry, I know it!” someone panted from behind him, and he "
turned to see Neville jogging toward him. “Guess what it is? I’m actu-
ally going to be able to remember it for once —” He waved the 
stunted little cactus he had 
shown them on the train. “
Mimbulus 
mimbletonia
!” 
"“Correct,” said the Fat Lady, and "
her portrait swung open toward 
"them like a door, revealing a circular"
 hole in the wall
" behind, through "
which Harry and Neville now climbed. 
The Gryffindor common room looked
" as welcoming as ever, a cozy "
circular tower room full of dilapi
dated squashy armchairs and rickety 
old tables. A fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people 
were warming their hands before goin
g up to their dormitories; on the 
other side of the room Fred and 
George Weasley were pinning some-
thing up on the notice board. 
Harry waved good night to them and 
headed straight for the door to th
e boys’ dormitories; he was not in 
much of a mood for talking at th
e moment. Neville followed him. 
Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan had reached the dormitory 
first and were in the process of co
vering the walls be
side their beds 
with posters and photographs. They had been talking as Harry 
pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw 
him. Harry wondered whether they ha
"d been talking about him, then "
whether he was being paranoid. 
"“Hi,” he said, moving"
 across to his own trunk and opening it. 
"“Hey, Harry,” said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pajamas in "
the West Ham colo
rs. “Good holiday?” 
"“Not bad,” muttered Harry, as a tr"
ue account of his holiday would 
have taken most of the night to rela
te and he could not face it. “You?” 
"“Yeah, it was okay,” chuckled Dean. “Better than Seamus’s anyway, "
he was just telling me.” 
   217 "“Why, what happened, Seamus?” Neville asked as he placed his "
Mimbulus mimbletonia 
tenderly on his bedside cabinet. 
Seamus did not answer immediately;
 he was making rather a meal 
of ensuring that his poster of th
e Kenmare Kestrels Quidditch team 
"was quite straight. Then he said, wi"
"th his back still turned to Harry, "
“Me mam didn’t want 
me to come back.” 
"“What?” said Harry, pausing in th"
e act of pulling 
off his robes. 
“She didn’t want me to come back to Hogwarts.” 
Seamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pajamas 
"out of his trunk, still not looking at Harry. "
"“But — why?” said Harry, astoni"
shed. He knew that Seamus’s 
"mother was a witch and could not understand, therefore, why she "
should have come over so Dursley-ish. 
Seamus did not answer until he ha
d finished buttoning his pajamas. 
"“Well,” he said in a measured voice, “I suppose . . . because of you.” "
“What d’you mean?” said Harry qu
ickly. His heart was beating 
rather fast. He felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him. 
"“Well,” said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry’s eyes, “she . . . er "
". . . well, it’s not just you,"
 it’s Dumbledore too . . .” 
“She believes the 
Daily Prophet
?” said Harry. “She
 thinks I’m a liar 
and Dumbledore’s 
an old fool?” 
Seamus looked up at him. “Y
"eah, something like that.” "
Harry said nothing. He threw his
 wand down onto his bedside 
"table, pulled off his robes, stuffed"
" them angrily into his trunk, and "
pulled on his pajamas. He was sick of
 it; sick of being the person who 
was stared at and talked about all th
e time. If any of 
"them knew, if any "
of them had the faintest idea what it
 felt like to be
 the one all these 
things had happened to . . . Mrs. 
"Finnigan had no idea, the stupid "
"woman, he thought savagely. "
He got into bed and made to pull 
"the hangings closed around him, "
"but before he could do so, Se"
"amus said, “Look . . . what "
did
 happen 
"that night when . . . you know, when "
. . . with Cedric Diggory and all?” 
 218 "Seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time. Dean, who "
"had been bending over his trunk, t"
"rying to retrieve a slipper, went "
oddly still and Harry knew 
he was listening hard. 
“What are you asking me for?” 
Harry retorted. “Just read the 
Daily 
Prophet
" like your mother, why don’t yo"
u? That’ll tell you all you need 
to know.” 
"“Don’t you have a go at my mother,” snapped Seamus. "
“I’ll have a go at anyone who 
"calls me a liar,” said Harry. "
“Don’t talk to me
 like that!” 
"“I’ll talk to you how I want,” said "
"Harry, his temper rising so fast he "
snatched his wand back from his be
dside table. “If you’ve got a prob-
"lem sharing a dormitory with me, go"
 and ask McGonagall if you can 
"be moved, stop your"
 mummy worrying —” 
"“Leave my mother out of this, Potter!” "
“What’s going on?” 
Ron had appeared in the doorway. 
His wide eyes traveled from 
"Harry, who was kneeling on his bed "
with his wand pointing at Sea-
"mus, to Seamus, who was standing"
 there with his fists raised. 
“He’s having a go at my mother!” Seamus yelled. 
"“What?” said Ron. “Harry wouldn’t do that — we met your mother, "
we liked her. . . .” 
“That’s before she started beli
eving every word the stinking 
Daily 
Prophet
 writes about me!” said Harry at the top of his voice. 
"“Oh,” said Ron, comprehension da"
wning across his freckled face. 
“Oh . . . right.” 
“You know what?” said Seamus 
"heatedly, casting Harry a venomous "
"look. “He’s right, I don’t want "
to share a dormitory with him any-
"more, he’s a madman.” "
"“That’s out of order, Seamus,” said "
"Ron, whose ears were starting to "
"glow red, always a danger sign. "
"“Out of order, am I?” shouted Se"
"amus, who in contrast with Ron  "
   219 was turning paler. “You believe all the rubbish he’s come out with 
"about You-Know-Who, do you, you re"
ckon he’s telling the truth?” 
"“Yeah, I do!” said Ron angrily. "
"“Then you’re mad too,” said Seamus in disgust. "
"“Yeah? Well unfortunately for you,"
" pal, I’m also a prefect!” said "
"Ron, jabbing himself in"
 the chest with a fing
er. “So unless you want 
"detention, watch your mouth!” "
Seamus looked for a few seconds 
as though detention would be a 
reasonable price to pay to say wh
at was going through his mind; but 
with a noise of contempt he turned 
"on his heel, vaulted into bed, and "
pulled the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped 
from the bed and fell in a dusty pi
le to the floor. Ron glared at Sea-
"mus, then looked at Dean and Neville. "
“Anyone else’s parents got a pr
oblem with Harry?” he said 
aggressively. 
"“My parents are Muggles, mate,”"
" said Dean, shrugging. “They "
don’t know nothing about no deat
"hs at Hogwarts, because I’m not "
stupid enough to tell them.” 
"“You don’t know my mother, she’ll "
weasel anything out of anyone!” 
Seamus snapped at him. “Anywa
"y, your parents don’t get the "
Daily 
"Prophet,"
 they don’t know our headmaster
’s been sacked from the Wiz-
engamot and the International Confed
eration of Wizards because he’s 
losing his marbles —” 
"“My gran says that’s rubbish,” pipe"
d up Neville. “She says it’s the 
Daily Prophet
" that’s going downhill, not Dumbledore. She’s canceled "
"our subscription. We believe Harry,” "
he said simply. He climbed into 
bed and pulled the covers up to his 
"chin, looking owlishly over them "
at Seamus. “My gran’s always said
 You-Know-Who would come back 
"one day. She says if Dumbledore says he’s back, he’s back.” "
Harry felt a rush of gratitude to
ward Neville. Nobody else said 
"anything. Seamus got out his wand, repaired the bed hangings, and  "
 220 vanished behind them. Dean got into 
"bed, rolled over, and fell silent. "
"Neville, who appeared to have nothin"
"g more to say either, was gazing "
fondly at his moonlit cactus. 
Harry lay back on his pillows while Ron bustled around the next 
"bed, putting his things away. He "
felt shaken by the argument with 
"Seamus, whom he had always liked very much. How many more peo-"
ple were going to suggest that he was lying or unhinged? 
"Had Dumbledore suffered like this all summer, as first the Wizen-"
"gamot, then the International Confederation of Wizards had thrown "
him from their ranks? Was it an
"ger at Harry, perhaps, that had "
stopped Dumbledore getting in touc
h with him for months? The two 
"of them were in this together, "
after all; Dumble
dore had believed 
"Harry, announced his version of event"
s to the whole school and then 
to the wider Wizarding community. Anyone who thought Harry was 
a liar had to think that Dumbledor
e was too or else that Dumbledore 
had been hoodwinked. . . . 
"They’ll know we’re right in the end,"
" thought Harry miserably, as Ron "
got into bed and extinguished the la
st candle in the dormitory. But he 
wondered how many attacks like Seamus’s he would have to endure 
before that time came. 
eamus dressed at top speed next
 morning and left the dormitory 
before Harry had even put on his socks. 
“Does he think he’ll turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me 
"too long?” asked Harry loudly, as th"
e hem of Seamus’s robes whipped 
out of sight. 
"“Don’t worry about it, Harry,” Dean "
"muttered, hoisting his school-"
bag onto his shoulder. “He’s just . . .” But apparently he was unable to 
"say exactly what Seamus was, and after a slightly awkward pause fol-"
lowed him out of the room. 
Neville and Ron both gave Harry it
"’s-his-problem-not-yours looks, "
but Harry was not much consoled. Ho
w much more of this was he 
going to have to take? 
“What’s the matter?” asked Hermio
"ne five minutes later, catching "
up with Harry and Ron halfway across the common room as they all 
headed toward breakfast. “You look absolutely — oh for heaven’s 
sake.” 
She was staring at the common room
" notice board, where a large "
new sign had been put up.

" “They are the limit,” said Hermio"
"ne grimly, taking down the sign, "
which Fred and George had pinned up 
over a poster giving the date of 
the first Hogsmeade weekend
 in October. “We’ll ha
"ve to talk to them, "
Ron.” 
Ron looked positively alarmed. 
“Why?” 
"“Because we’re prefects!” said Hermione, as they climbed out "
through the portrait hole. “It’s up to us to stop this kind of thing!” 
Ron said nothing; Harry could tell
 from his glum expression that 
the prospect of stopping Fred an
d George doing exactly what they 
liked was not one that he found inviting. 
"“Anyway, what’s up, Harry?” Hermione continued, as they walked "
down a flight of stairs lined with po
rtraits of old witc
"hes and wizards, "
"all of whom ignored them, being engrossed in their own conversation. "
“You look really an
gry about something.” 
“Seamus reckons Harry’s lying ab
"out You-Know-Who,” said Ron "
"succinctly, when Harry"
 did not respond. 
"Hermione, whom Harry had expected "
"to react angrily on his behalf, "
sighed. 
"“Yes, Lavender thinks so "
"too,” she said gloomily. "
“Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I’m a 
"lying, attention-seeking prat, "
have you?” Harry said loudly. 
"“No,” said Hermione calmly, “I to"
ld her to keep her big fat mouth 
   223 "shut about you, actually. And it wo"
uld be quite nice if you stopped 
"jumping down Ron’s and my throats, Harry, because if you haven’t "
"noticed, we’re on your side.” "
There was a short pause. 
"“Sorry,” said Har"
ry in a low voice. 
"“That’s quite all right,” said "
Hermione with dignity. Then she 
shook her head. “Don’t you rememb
er what Dumbledore said at the 
end-of-term feast last year?” 
"Harry and Ron both looked at her blankly, and Hermione sighed "
again. 
"“About You-Know-Who. He said, ‘"
His gift for spreading discord and 
enmity is very great. We can fight it
 only by showing an equally strong 
bond of friend
ship and trust
 —’” 
“How do you remember stuff like th
"at?” asked Ron, "
looking at her 
in admiration. 
"“I listen, Ron,” said Hermione with a touch of asperity. "
"“So do I, but I stil"
l couldn’t tell yo
u exactly what —” 
"“The point,” Hermione pressed on lo"
"udly, “is that this sort of thing "
is exactly what Dumbledore was talking about. You-Know-Who’s 
"only been back two months, and "
we’ve started fighting among our-
"selves. And the Sorting Hat’s warning was the same — stand together, "
be united —” 
"“And Harry said it last night,” re"
"torted Ron, “if "
that means we’re 
"supposed to get matey with the Slytherins, fat chance.” "
"“Well, I think it’s a pity we’re no"
t trying for a bit of inter-House 
"unity,” said Hermione crossly. "
They had reached the foot of the marble staircase. A line of fourth-
year Ravenclaws was crossing the ent
rance hall; they caught sight of 
Harry and hurried to form a tighter 
"group, as though frightened he "
might attack stragglers. 
"“Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like "
"that,” said Harry sarcastically. "
 224 They followed the Ravenclaws in
"to the Great Hall, looking in-"
stinctively at the staff table as th
ey entered. Professor Grubbly-Plank 
"was chatting to Professor Sinistra, the Astronomy teacher, and Hagrid "
was once again conspicuous only by
 his absence. The enchanted ceil-
ing above them echoed Harry’s mood;
 it was a miserable rain-cloud 
gray. 
“Dumbledore didn’t even mention 
how long that Grubbly-Plank 
"woman’s staying,” he said, as th"
ey made their way across to the 
Gryffindor table. 
“Maybe . . .” said He
rmione thoughtfully. 
“What?” said both Harry and Ron together. 
“Well . . . maybe he di
dn’t want to draw at
tention to Hagrid not 
being here.” 
"“What d’you mean, draw attention to"
" it?” said Ron, half laughing. "
“How could we not notice?” 
"Before Hermione could answer, a tall black girl with long, braided "
hair had marched up to Harry. 
"“Hi, Angelina.” "
"“Hi,” she said briskly, “good summ"
er?” And without waiting for an 
"answer, “Listen, I’ve been made"
 Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.” 
"“Nice one,” said Harry, grinning at"
 her; he suspected Angelina’s 
pep talks might not be as long-w
"inded as Oliver Wood’s had been, "
which could only be an improvement. 
"“Yeah, well, we need a new Keeper "
now Oliver’s left. Tryouts are on 
Friday at five o’clock and I want th
"e whole team there, all right? Then "
we can see how the ne
w person’ll fit in.” 
"“Okay,” said Harry, and she "
smiled at him and departed. 
"“I’d forgotten Wood had left,” said"
" Hermione vaguely, sitting down "
beside Ron and pulling a plate of toas
t toward her. “I suppose that will 
make quite a difference to the team?” 
"“I s’pose,” said Harry, taking "
the bench opposite. “He was a good 
Keeper. . . .” 
   225 "“Still, it won’t hurt to have some"
" new blood, will it?” said Ron. "
With a 
whoosh
" and a clatter, hundreds "
of owls came soaring in 
through the upper windows. They de
"scended all over the Hall, bring-"
ing letters and packages to their owners and showering the breakfasters 
with droplets of water; it was clearly raining hard outside. Hedwig was 
"nowhere to be seen, but Harry was hardly surprised; his only corre-"
"spondent was Sirius, and he doubted"
 Sirius would have anything new 
to tell him after only twenty-four
" hours apart. Hermione, however, "
had to move her orange juice asid
e quickly to make way for a large 
damp barn owl 
bearing a sodden 
Daily Prophet
 in its beak. 
“What are you still getting that for?
” said Harry irri
"tably, thinking "
"of Seamus, as Hermione placed a "
Knut in the leather pouch on the 
owl’s leg and it took off again. 
“I’m not bothering . . . load of 
rubbish.” 
"“It’s best to know what the enemy are saying,” said Hermione "
"darkly, and she unfurled the news"
"paper and disappeared behind it, "
not emerging until Harry and 
Ron had finished eating. 
"“Nothing,” she said simply, rolling"
 up the newspaper and laying it 
down by her plate. “Nothing about you or Dumbledore or anything.” 
Professor McGonagall was now mo
ving along the table handing 
out schedules. 
“Look at today!” groane
"d Ron. “History of Magic, double Potions, "
"Divination, and double Defense Agai"
"nst the Dark Arts . . . Binns, "
"Snape, Trelawney, and th"
at Umbridge woman all in
 one day! I wish Fred 
and George’d hurry up and get those Skiving Snackboxes sorted. . . .” 
“Do mine ears deceive me?” said 
"Fred, arriving with George and "
squeezing onto the bench beside 
Harry. “Hogwarts prefects surely 
don’t wish to sk
ive off lessons?” 
"“Look what we’ve got today,” said Ron grumpily, shoving his "
schedule under Fred’s nose. “That’s 
the worst Monday I’ve ever seen.” 
"“Fair point, little bro,” said Fr"
"ed, scanning the column. “You can "
have a bit of Nosebleed No
ugat cheap if you like.” 
 226 “Why’s it cheap?” said Ron suspiciously. 
“Because you’ll keep bleeding till 
"you shrivel up, we haven’t got an "
"antidote yet,” said George, helping himself to a kipper. "
"“Cheers,” said Ron moodily, pocket"
"ing his schedule, “but I think "
I’ll take the lessons.” 
“And speaking of your Skiving Sn
"ackboxes,” said Hermione, eyeing "
"Fred and George beadily, “you ca"
n’t advertise for testers on the 
Gryffindor notice board.” 
"“Says who?” said George, looking astonished. "
"“Says me,” said Hermione. “And Ron.” "
"“Leave me out of it,”"
 said Ron hastily. 
Hermione glared at him. Fr
ed and George sniggered. 
"“You’ll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,” said "
"Fred, thickly buttering a crumpet. "
"“You’re starting your fifth year, "
you’ll be begging us for 
a Snackbox before long.” 
“And why would starting fifth ye
ar mean I want a Skiving Snack-
box?” asked Hermione. 
“Fifth year’s O.W.L. 
"year,” said George. "
“So?” 
“So you’ve got your exams coming up
", haven’t you? They’ll be keep-"
ing your noses so hard 
"to that grindstone they’ll be rubbed raw,” said "
Fred with satisfaction. 
“Half our year had minor breakdow
"ns coming up to O.W.L.s,” said "
George happily. “Tears and tantrums . . . Patricia Stimpson kept com-
ing over faint. . . .” 
“Kenneth Towler came out in boil
"s, d’you remember?” said Fred "
reminiscently. 
“That’s ’cause you put Bulbadox 
"Powder in his pajamas,” said "
George. 
"“Oh yeah,” said Fred, grinning. “I’d"
 forgotten. . . . Hard to keep 
"track sometimes, isn’t it?” "
"“Anyway, it’s a nightmare of a year"
", the fifth,” said George. “If you "
   227 care about exam results anyway. Fred
 and I managed to keep our spir-
its up somehow.” 
"“Yeah . . . you got, what was it, "
three O.W.L.s each?” said Ron. 
"“Yep,” said Fred unconcernedly. “B"
ut we feel our futures lie outside 
the world of academic achievement.” 
“We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming 
"back for our seventh year,” said "
"George brightly, “now that we’ve "
got —” 
"He broke off at a warning look from Harry, who knew George had "
been about to mention the Triwizar
d winnings he had given them. 
"“— now that we’ve got our O.W.L.s,"
"” George said hastily. “I mean, "
do we really need N.E.W.T.s? But we
 didn’t think Mum could take us 
"leaving school early, not on top of Percy turning out to be the world’s "
biggest prat.” 
“We’re not going to waste our last
" year here, though,” said Fred, "
looking affectionately around at the 
Great Hall. “We’re 
going to use it 
"to do a bit of market research, find out exactly what the average Hog-"
warts student requires from his joke 
"shop, carefully evaluate the results "
"of our research, and then produce the products to fit the demand.” "
“But where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop?” 
asked Hermione skeptically. “You’re 
going to need all the ingredients 
and materials — and premises
" too, I suppose. . . .” "
Harry did not look at th
e twins. His face felt hot; he deliberately 
dropped his fork and dived down to 
retrieve it. He heard Fred say 
"overhead, “Ask us no questions an"
"d we’ll tell you no lies, Hermione. "
"C’mon, George, if we get there early "
we might be able to sell a few Ex-
tendable Ears before Herbology.” 
Harry emerged from under the table 
to see Fred and George walk-
"ing away, each carrying a stack of toast. "
“What did that mean?” said He
"rmione, looking from Harry to "
Ron. “‘Ask us no questions . . .’ 
Does that mean they’ve already got 
some gold to start a joke shop?” 
 228 "“You know, I’ve been wondering ab"
"out that,” said Ron, his brow "
furrowed. “They bought me a new se
t of dress robes 
"this summer, and "
I couldn’t understand where th
ey got the Galleons. . . .” 
Harry decided it was time to stee
r the conversation out of these 
dangerous waters. 
“D’you reckon it’s true this year’s
 going to be really tough? Because 
of the exams?” 
"“Oh yeah,” said Ron. “Bound to "
"be, isn’t it? O.W.L.s are really "
"important, affect the jobs you can "
apply for and everything. We get 
"career advice too, later this year, "
Bill told me. So you can choose what 
N.E.W.T.s you want to do next year.” 
“D’you know what you want to do after Hogwarts?” Harry asked 
"the other two, as they left the Grea"
t Hall shortly afterward and set off 
toward their History of Magic classroom. 
"“Not really,” said Ron slow"
ly. “Except . . . well . . .” 
He looked slightly sheepish. 
“What?” Harry urged him. 
"“Well, it’d be cool to be an Auro"
"r,” said Ron in an offhand voice. "
"“Yeah, it would,” said Harry fervently. "
"“But they’re, like, the elite,” said "
Ron. “You’ve got to be really good. 
"What about you, Hermione?” "
"“I don’t know,” said Hermione. “I "
think I’d really like to do some-
thing worthwhile.” 
“An Auror’s worthwhile!” said Harry. 
"“Yes, it is, but it’s not the only "
"worthwhile thing,” said Hermione "
"thoughtfully. “I mean, if I could take S.P.E.W. further . . .” "
Harry and Ron carefully avoide
d looking at each other. 
History of Magic was by common 
consent the most boring subject 
ever devised by Wizard-kind. Profes
"sor Binns, their ghost teacher, had "
"a wheezy, droning voice that was al"
most guaranteed to cause severe 
"drowsiness within ten minutes, five "
in warm weather. He never varied 
"the form of their lessons, but lectured them without pausing while "
   229 "they took notes, or rather, gazed "
sleepily into space. Harry and Ron 
had so far managed to sc
rape passes in this subject only by copying 
Hermione’s notes before exams; she al
one seemed able to resist the so-
porific power of Binns’s voice. 
Today they suffered through three quarters of an hour’s droning on 
the subject of giant wa
rs. Harry heard just enoug
h within the first ten 
minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher’s hands this 
subject might have been mildly in
"teresting, but then his brain "
"disengaged, and he spent the rema"
ining thirty-five minutes playing 
hangman on a corner of his parc
"hment with Ron, while Hermione "
shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye. 
"“How would it be,” she asked them coldly as they left the classroom "
for break (Binns drifting away thro
"ugh the blackboard), “if I refused "
to lend you my notes this year?” 
"“We’d fail our O.W.L.s,” said Ron."
 “If you want that on your con-
"science, Hermione . . .” "
"“Well, you’d deserve it,” she snapped. “You don’t even try to listen "
"to him, do you?” "
"“We do try,” said Ron. “We just ha"
ven’t got your brains or your 
memory or your concentration — you’
re just cleverer than we are — 
is it nice to rub it in?” 
"“Oh, don’t give me that rubbish,"
"” said Hermione, but she looked "
slightly mollified as she led the 
way out into the damp courtyard. 
"A fine misty drizzle was falling, so that the people standing in hud-"
"dles around the yard looked blurred at the edges. Harry, Ron, and "
Hermione chose a secluded corner 
"under a heavily dripping balcony, "
turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air 
and talking about what Snape was like
ly to set them in the first lesson 
of the year. They had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be 
"something extremely difficult, just to catch them off guard after a "
"two-month holiday, when someone wa"
lked around the corner toward 
them. 
 230 "“Hello, Harry!” "
It was Cho Chang and what was mo
"re, she was on her own again. "
This was most unusual: Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang 
of giggling girls; Harry remembered 
the agony of trying to get her by 
herself to ask her to the Yule Ball. 
"“Hi,” said Harry, feeling his face grow hot. "
At least you’re not covered 
"in Stinksap this time,"
 he told himself. Cho seemed to be thinking along 
the same lines. 
“You got that st
"uff off, then?” "
"“Yeah,” said Harry, trying to grin"
 as though the memory of their 
last meeting was funny as opposed to
 mortifying. “So did you . . . er 
. . . have a good summer?” 
The moment he had said this he wished he hadn’t: Cedric had been 
Cho’s boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her 
holiday almost as badly as it ha
d affected Harry’s. . . . Something 
"seemed to tauten in her face, but sh"
"e said, “Oh, it was all right, you "
know. . . .” 
“Is that a Tornados badge?” Ron 
"demanded suddenly, pointing at "
"the front of Cho’s robes, to which "
a sky-blue badge emblazoned with 
a double gold T was pi
nned. “You don’t suppo
"rt them, do you?” "
"“Yeah, I do,” said Cho. "
"“Have you always supported them, or just since they started win-"
"ning the league?” said Ron, in wh"
at Harry considered an unnecessarily 
accusatory tone of voice. 
“I’ve supported them since I was si
"x,” said Cho coolly. “Anyway . . . "
"see you, Harry.” "
She walked away. Hermione waited
 until Cho was halfway across 
the courtyard before rounding on Ron. 
“You are so tactless!” 
“What? I only asked her if —” 
“Couldn’t you tell she wanted to
 talk to Harry on her own?” 
   231 "“So? She could’ve done, "
I wasn’t stopping —” 
“What on earth were you attacking her about her Quidditch team 
for?” 
“Attacking? I wasn
"’t attacking her,"
 I was only —” 
“Who 
cares
 if she supports the Tornados?” 
"“Oh, come on, half the people yo"
u see wearing those badges only 
bought them last season —” 
“But what does it 
matter
?” 
“It means they’re not real fans
", they’re just jumping on the "
bandwagon —” 
"“That’s the bell,” said Harry list"
"lessly, because Ron and Hermione "
were bickering too loudly to hear it
. They did not stop arguing all the 
"way down to Snape’s dungeon, which "
gave Harry plenty of time to re-
flect that between Neville and Ron he 
would be lucky ever to have two 
minutes’ conversation with Cho that
 he could look back on without 
wanting to leave the country. 
"And yet, he thought, as they jo"
ined the queue lining up outside 
"Snape’s classroom door, sh"
e had chosen to come an
"d talk to him, hadn’t "
she? She had been Cedric’s girlfriend;
 she could easily have hated Harry 
for coming out of the Triwizard ma
"ze alive when Cedric had died, yet "
she was talking to him in a perfectl
"y friendly way, not as though she "
"thought him mad, or a liar, or in some horrible way responsible for "
"Cedric’s death. . . . Yes, she had definitely chosen to come and talk to "
"him, and that made the second time"
 in two days . . . and at this 
"thought, Harry’s spirits rose. Even the ominous sound of Snape’s dun-"
geon door creaking open did not pu
"ncture the small, hopeful bubble "
that seemed to have swelled in his chest. He filed into the classroom be-
hind Ron and Hermione and followed them to their usual table at the 
"back, ignoring the huffy, irritable no"
ises now issuing from both of them. 
"“Settle down,” said Snape coldly, "
shutting the door behind him. 
There was no real need for the call 
to order; the moment the class  
 232 "had heard the door close, quiet had "
fallen and all fidgeting stopped. 
Snape’s mere presence was usually en
ough to ensure a class’s silence. 
"“Before we begin today’s lesson,” sa"
"id Snape, sweeping over to his "
"desk and staring around at them all,"
 “I think it appropriate to remind 
you that next June you will be sitt
"ing an important examination, dur-"
ing which you will prove how much
 you have learned about the 
composition and us
e of magical potions. Mo
ronic though some of 
"this class undoubtedly are, I expect"
 you to scrape an ‘Acceptable’ in 
"your O.W.L., or suffer "
my . . . displeasure.” 
His gaze lingered this time
" upon Neville, who gulped. "
"“After this year, of course, many "
of you will cease studying with 
"me,” Snape went on. “I take only the very best into my N.E.W.T. "
"Potions class, which means that some"
 of us will certainly be saying 
good-bye.” 
"His eyes rested on Harry and his lip curled. Harry glared back, feel-"
ing a grim pleasure at the idea that 
he would be able to give up Potions 
after fifth year. 
“But we have another year to go
 before that happy moment of 
"farewell,” said Snape softly, “so whether you are intending to attempt "
"N.E.W.T. or not, I advise all of "
you to concentrate your efforts upon 
maintaining the high-pass level I have come to expect from my 
O.W.L. students. 
“Today we will be mixing a potion 
that often comes up at Ordinary 
Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peac
"e, a potion to calm anxiety and "
soothe agitation. Be warned: If 
you are too heavy-handed with the 
ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irre-
"versible sleep, so you will need to "
pay close attention to what you are 
"doing.” On Harry’s left, Hermione sat up a little straighter, her expres-"
sion one of the utmost attentivene
ss. “The ingredients and method” 
— Snape flicked his wand — “are 
on the blackboard” — (they ap-
peared there) — “you will find everything you need” — he flicked his  
   233 wand again — “in the st
ore cupboard” — (the door of the said cup-
board sprang open) — “y
ou have an hour and 
a half. . . . Start.” 
"Just as Harry, Ron, and Hermione had predicted, Snape could "
hardly have set them a more diffic
"ult, fiddly potion. The ingredients "
had to be added to the cauldron in
 precisely the right order and quan-
tities; the mixture had to be stirred 
"exactly the right number of times, "
"firstly in clockwise, then in counte"
rclockwise directions; the heat of 
the flames on which it was simmering
 had to be lowered to exactly the 
right level for a specific number of 
minutes before the final ingredient 
was added. 
"“A light silver vapor should now be rising from your potion,” called "
"Snape, with ten mi"
nutes left to go. 
"Harry, who was sweating profusely,"
 looked desperately around the 
dungeon. His own cauldron was issu
ing copious amounts of dark gray 
steam; Ron’s was spitting green sparks. Seamus was feverishly prod-
ding the flames at the base of his ca
"uldron with the tip of his wand, as "
they had gone out. The surface of 
"Hermione’s potion, however, was a "
"shimmering mist of silver vapor, "
and as Snape swept by he looked 
down his hooked nose at it withou
"t comment, which meant that he "
could find nothing to criticize. At
" Harry’s cauldron, however, Snape "
"stopped, looking down at"
 Harry with a horrible
 smirk on his face. 
"“Potter, what is th"
is supposed to be?” 
The Slytherins at the front of the 
class all looked up eagerly; they 
loved hearing Snape taunt Harry. 
“The Draught of
" Peace,” said "
Harry tensely. 
"“Tell me, Potter,” said Snape softly, “can you read?” "
Draco Malfoy laughed. 
"“Yes, I can,” said Harry, his fi"
ngers clenched tightly around his 
wand. 
“Read the third line 
"of the instructions for me, Potter.” "
Harry squinted at the blackboard; it was not easy to make out the  
 234 instructions through the haze of 
multicolored steam now filling the 
dungeon. 
"“‘Add powdered moonstone, stir "
"three times counterclockwise, al-"
"low to simmer for seven minutes,"
 then add two drops of syrup of 
hellebore.’” 
His heart sank. He had not added 
"syrup of hellebore, but had pro-"
ceeded straight to the fourth line of
 the instructions after allowing his 
potion to simmer for seven minutes. 
“Did you do everything on 
"the third line, Potter?” "
"“No,” said Harry very quietly. "
“I beg your pardon?” 
"“No,” said Harry, more loudly. "
“I forgot the hellebore. . . .” 
"“I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly "
worthless. 
Evanesco.
” 
The contents of Harry’s potion vani
shed; he was left standing fool-
ishly beside an 
empty cauldron. 
“Those of you who 
have
" managed to read the instructions, fill one "
"flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name, "
and bring it up to my desk for 
"testing,” said Snape. “Homework: "
twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its 
"uses in potion-making, to be"
 handed in on Thursday.” 
While everyone around him filled th
"eir flagons, Harry cleared away "
"his things, seething. His potion ha"
"d been no worse than Ron’s, which "
was now giving off a foul odor of 
"bad eggs, or Neville’s, which had "
achieved the consistency of just-m
ixed cement and which Neville was 
now having to gouge out of his ca
"uldron, yet it was he, Harry, who "
would be receiving zero marks for the day’s work. He stuffed his wand 
back into his bag and slumped down 
"onto his seat, watching everyone "
else march up to Snape’s desk with 
filled and corked flagons. When at 
"long last the bell rang, Harry was fi"
rst out of the dungeon and had al-
ready started his lunch by
 the time Ron and Herm
ione joined him in  
   235 the Great Hall. The ceiling had tur
ned an even murkier gray during 
the morning. Rain was lashing the high windows. 
"“That was really unfair,” said Hermione consolingly, sitting down "
next to Harry and helping herself to
 shepherd’s pie. “Your potion 
"wasn’t nearly as bad as Goyle’s, when he put it in his flagon the whole "
thing shattered and set 
his robes on fire.” 
"“Yeah, well,” said Harry, glower"
"ing at his plate, “since when has "
Snape ever been fair to me?” 
Neither of the others answered; al
l three of them knew that Snape 
and Harry’s mutual enmity had 
been absolute from the moment 
Harry had set foot in Hogwarts. 
“I did think he might be a bit bett
"er this year,” said Hermione in a "
disappointed voice. “I mean . . . yo
u know . . .” She looked carefully 
around; there were half a dozen empty 
seats on either side of them and 
nobody was passing the table. “.
 . . Now he’s in the Order and 
everything.” 
“Poisonous toadstools don’t change
" their spots,” said Ron sagely. "
"“Anyway, I’ve always thought Dumbledore was cracked trusting "
"Snape, where’s the evidence he ever"
 really stopped working for You-
Know-Who?” 
"“I think Dumbledore’s probably got plenty of evidence, even if he "
"doesn’t share it with you, Ron,” snapped Hermione. "
"“Oh, shut up, the pair of you,” "
"said Harry heavily, as Ron opened "
his mouth to argue back. Hermione 
"and Ron both froze, looking an-"
gry and offended. “Can’t you give it
 a rest?” he said. “You’re always 
"having a go at each other, it’s "
driving me mad.” And abandoning his 
"shepherd’s pie, he swung his schoolba"
g back over his shoulder and left 
them sitting there. 
He walked up the marble staircas
"e two steps at a time, past the "
many students hurrying toward lunch.
 The anger that had just flared 
so unexpectedly still blazed inside
" him, and the visi"
on of Ron and  
 236 Hermione’s shocked faces afforded 
him a sense of deep satisfaction. 
"Serve them right,"
 he thought. 
Why can’t they give it a rest
? . . .
 Bickering 
all the time
 . . .
 It’s enough to driv
e anyone up the wall
. . . . 
He passed the large picture of Sir 
Cadogan the knight on a landing; 
Sir Cadogan drew his sword and bran
"dished it fiercely at Harry, who "
ignored him. 
"“Come back, you scurvy dog, stand "
fast and fight!” yelled Sir Cado-
"gan in a muffled voice from behind his visor, but Harry merely walked "
"on, and when Sir Cadogan attempte"
d to follow him by running into 
"a neighboring picture, he was rebu"
"ffed by its inhabitant, a large and "
angry-looking wolfhound. 
Harry spent the rest of the lunch ho
ur sitting alone underneath the 
"trapdoor at the top of North Tower, "
and consequently he was the first 
to ascend the silver ladder that le
d to Sibyll Trelawney’s classroom 
when the bell rang. 
Divination was Harry’s least favorite
" class after Potions, which was "
due mainly to Professor Trelawney’s 
habit of predicting his premature 
death every few lessons. A thin woma
"n, heavily draped in shawls and "
"glittering with strings of beads, "
she always reminded Harry of some 
"kind of insect, with her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes. She was "
"busy putting copies of battered, le"
ather-bound books on each of the 
spindly little tables with which 
her room was littered when Harry en-
"tered the room, but so dim was the light cast by the lamps covered by "
"scarves and the low-burning, sickly-scented fire that she appeared not "
to notice him as he took a seat in the shadows. The rest of the class ar-
rived over the next five minute
"s. Ron emerged from the trapdoor, "
"looked around carefully, spotted "
"Harry and made directly for him, or "
as directly as he could while havi
"ng to wend his way between tables, "
"chairs, and overstuffed poufs. "
"“Hermione and me have stopped arguing,” he said, sitting down "
beside Harry. 
"“Good,” grunted Harry. "
   237 “But Hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you stopped tak-
"ing out your temper on us,” said Ron. "
“I’m not —” 
"“I’m just passing on the message,” "
"said Ron, talking over him. “But "
I reckon she’s right. It’s not ou
r fault how Seamus and Snape treat 
you.” 
“I never said it —” 
"“Good day,” said Professor Trelawney"
" in her usual misty, dreamy "
"voice, and Harry broke off, feeling both annoyed and slightly "
ashamed of himself again. “And we
"lcome back to Divination. I have, "
"of course, been following your fortu"
nes most carefully over the holi-
"days, and am delighted to see that you have all returned to Hogwarts "
"safely — as, of course, I knew you would. "
“You will find on the tabl
es before you copies of 
"The Dream Oracle,"
by Inigo Imago. Dream interpretation is a most important means of di-
vining the future and one that may 
very probably be tested in your 
"O.W.L. Not, of course, that I believ"
e examination passes or failures are 
of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of div-
"ination. If you have the Seeing Eye, "
certificates and grades matter very 
"little. However, the headmaster likes yo"
"u to sit the examination, so . . .” "
"Her voice trailed away delicately, leaving them all in no doubt that "
Professor Trelawney considered her 
subject above such
 sordid matters 
as examinations. 
"“Turn, please, to the introduction and read what Imago has to say "
on the matter of dream interpretati
on. Then divide into pairs. Use 
The Dream Oracle
 to interpret each other’s most recent dreams. Carry 
on. 
The one good thing to be said for 
this lesson was th
at it was not a 
double period. By the time they ha
d all finished reading the introduc-
"tion of the book, they had barely "
ten minutes left fo
r dream interpre-
tation. At the table next to Harry an
"d Ron, Dean had paired up with "
"Neville, who immediately embarked "
on a long-winded explanation of 
 238 a nightmare involving a pair of 
giant scissors wearing his grand-
mother’s best hat; Harry and Ron me
rely looked at each other glumly. 
"“I never remember my dreams,”"
 said Ron. “You say one.” 
"“You must remember one of them,” said Harry impatiently. "
He was not going to share his dreams with anyone. He knew per-
fectly well what his regular nightmar
"e about a graveyard meant, he did "
not need Ron or Professor Trelawney or the stupid 
Dream Oracle
 to 
tell him that. . . . 
"“Well, I had one that I was play"
"ing Quidditch the other night,” "
"said Ron, screwing up his face in"
 an effort to remember. “What d’you 
reckon that means?” 
“Probably that you’re going to be
 eaten by a giant marshmallow or 
"something,” said Harry, turning the pages of "
The Dream Oracle
 with-
out interest. 
It was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the 
Oracle
 and 
Harry was not cheered up when Profe
ssor Trelawney set them the task 
of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework. When the bell 
"went, he and Ron led the way back"
" down the ladder, Ron grumbling "
loudly. 
“D’you realize how much homework we’ve got already? Binns set 
us a foot-and-a-half-long essay on 
"giant wars, Snape wants a foot on "
"the use of moonstones, and now we’v"
e got a month’s dream diary from 
"Trelawney! Fred and George weren’t wrong about O.W.L. year, were "
they? That Umbridge woman had be
tter not give us any. . . .” 
When they entered the Defense Agai
nst the Dark Arts classroom 
they found Professor Umbridge alre
"ady seated at the teacher’s desk, "
wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of
 the night before 
and the black vel-
vet bow on top of her head. Harry 
was again reminded forcibly of a 
large fly perched unwisely on 
top of an even larger toad. 
The class was quiet as it entere
d the room; Professor Umbridge 
"was, as yet, an unknown quantity and nobody knew yet how strict a "
disciplinarian she was likely to be. 
   239 "“Well, good afternoon!” she said "
when finally the whole class had 
sat down. 
A few people mumbled “Good
" afternoon,” in reply. "
"“Tut, tut,” said Professor Umbridge. “"
That
" won’t do, now, will it? I "
"should like you, please, to reply ‘Good afternoon, Professor Um-"
"bridge.’ One more time, plea"
"se. Good afternoon, class!” "
"“Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge"
",” they chanted back at her. "
"“There, now,” said Professor Umbr"
idge sweetly. “That wasn’t too 
"difficult, was it? "
Wands away and quil
"ls out, please.” "
Many of the class exchanged gloomy looks; the order “wands away” 
had never yet been followed by a le
sson they had found interesting. 
Harry shoved his wand back inside 
"his bag and pulled out quill, ink, "
"and parchment. Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted "
"her own wand, which was an unusua"
"lly short one, and tapped the "
blackboard sharply with it; words 
appeared on the board at once: 
Defense Against the Dark Arts 
A Return to Basic Principles. 
"“Well now, your teaching in this"
 subject has been rather disrupted 
"and fragmented, hasn’t it?” stated "
"Professor Umbridge, "
turning to face 
the class with her hands clasped neatly
 in front of her. “The constant 
"changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed "
"any Ministry-approved curriculum, "
has unfortunately resulted in 
your being far below the standard 
we would expect to see in your 
O.W.L. year. 
"“You will be pleased to know, howe"
"ver, that these problems are now "
to be rectified. We will be foll
"owing a carefully structured, theory-"
"centered, Ministry-approved course"
 of defensive ma
gic this year. 
Copy down the foll
"owing, please.” "
She rapped the blackboard again;
 the first message vanished and 
was replaced by: 
 240 Course aims: 
1.
Understanding the principles underlying defensive magic. 
2.
Learning to recognize situations in which defensive magic 
can legally be used. 
3.
Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for 
practical use. 
For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratch-
ing quills on parchment. When everyone had copied down Professor 
"Umbridge’s three course aims she said, “Has everybody got a copy of "
Defensive Magical Theory
 by Wilbert Slinkhard?” 
There was a dull murmur of as
sent throughout the class. 
"“I think we’ll try that again,” "
said Professor Umbridge. “When I 
"ask you a question, I should like "
"you to reply ‘Yes, Professor Um-"
"bridge,’ or ‘No, Professor Umbridge.’ So, has everyone got a copy of "
Defensive Magical Theory
 by Wilbert Slinkhard?” 
"“Yes, Professor Umbridge,”"
 rang through the room. 
"“Good,” said Professor Umbridge. “I"
 should like yo
u to turn to 
"page five and read chapter one, ‘Basics for Beginners.’ There will be "
no need to talk.” 
Professor Umbridge left the blackb
oard and settled herself in the 
"chair behind the teacher’s desk, obse"
rving them all wi
th those pouchy 
toad’s eyes. Harry turned to page five of his copy of 
Defensive Magical 
Theory
 and started to read. 
"It was desperately dull, quite as ba"
d as listening to Professor Binns. 
He felt his concentration sliding away from him; he had soon read the 
same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few 
words. Several silent minutes passe
"d. Next to him, Ron was absent-"
mindedly turning his quill over and ov
"er in his fingers, staring at the "
same spot on the page. Harry looked 
right and received a surprise to 
shake him out of his torpor. Hermio
ne had not even opened her copy 
   241  of 
Defensive Magical Theory.
 She was staring fixedly at Professor Um-
bridge with her hand in the air. 
Harry could not remember
 Hermione ever neglecting to read when 
"instructed to, or indeed resisting "
the temptation to open any book 
that came under her nose. He look
"ed at her questioningly, but she "
merely shook her head slightly to 
indicate that she was not about to 
"answer questions, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who "
was looking just as resolute
ly in another direction. 
"After several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the "
only one watching Hermione. The ch
apter they had been instructed 
to read was so tedious that more 
and more people were choosing to 
watch Hermione’s mute attempt to 
catch Professor Umbridge’s eye 
than to struggle on with “Basics for Beginners.” 
When more than half the class we
re staring at Hermione rather 
"than at their books, Professor Umbr"
idge seemed to decide that she 
could ignore the situation no longer. 
“Did you want to ask something 
"about the chapter, dear?” she "
"asked Hermione, as though she "
had only just noticed her. 
"“Not about the chapter,"
" no,” said Hermione. "
"“Well, we’re reading just now,” "
"said Professor Umbridge, showing "
"her small, pointed teeth. “If you ha"
ve other queries we can deal with 
them at the end of class.” 
"“I’ve got a query about your course aims,” said Hermione. "
Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows. 
“And your name is — ?” 
"“Hermione Granger,” said Hermione. "
"“Well, Miss Granger, I think the co"
urse aims are perfectly clear if 
"you read them through carefully,” sa"
id Professor Umbridge in a voice 
of determined sweetness. 
"“Well, I don’t,” said Hermione bl"
untly. “There’s nothing written 
up there about 
using
 defensive spells.” 
 242 There was a short silence in wh
ich many members of the class 
turned their heads to frown at the 
three course aims still written on 
the blackboard. 
“
Using 
defensive spells?” Professor Umbr
idge repeated with a little 
"laugh. “Why, I can’t imagine any si"
tuation arising in my classroom 
that would require you to 
use
" a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You "
surely aren’t expecting to be attacked during class?” 
“We’re not going to use magi
c?” Ron ejaculated loudly. 
“Students raise their hands when they
" wish to speak in my class, "
Mr. — ?” 
"“Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air. "
"Professor Umbridge, smiling still mo"
"re widely, turned her back on "
him. Harry and Hermione immediatel
y raised their hands too. Pro-
fessor Umbridge’s pouchy eyes linger
ed on Harry for a moment before 
she addressed Hermione. 
"“Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted"
 to ask some
thing else?” 
"“Yes,” said Hermione. “Surely th"
e whole point of Defense Against 
the Dark Arts is to prac
tice defensive spells?” 
“Are you a Ministry-trained educ
"ational expert, Miss Granger?” "
asked Professor Umbridge in her falsely sweet voice. 
"“No, but —” "
"“Well then, I’m afraid you are not qualified to decide what the "
‘whole point’ of any class is. Wiza
rds much older and cleverer than 
you have devised our new program of
 study. You will be learning 
"about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way —” "
“What use is that?” said Harry loudly. “If we’re going to be attacked 
it won’t be in a —” 
“
"Hand,"
 Mr. Potter!” sang Professor Umbridge. 
Harry thrust his fist in the air.
 Professor Umbridge promptly 
"turned away from him again, but "
now several other people had their 
hands up too. 
“And your name is?” Professor Umbridge said to Dean. 
   243 “Dean Thomas.” 
"“Well, Mr. Thomas?” "
"“Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it?”"
 said Dean. “If we’re going to be 
"attacked, it won’t be risk-free —” "
"“I repeat,” said Professor Umbrid"
"ge, smiling in a "
very irritating 
"fashion at Dean, “do you expect to "
be attacked during my classes?” 
"“No, but —” "
Professor Umbridge talked over him. 
“I do not wish to criticize the wa
y things have been run in this 
"school,” she said, an unconvincing "
"smile stretching her wide mouth, "
“but you have been exposed to some 
very irresponsible 
wizards in this 
"class, very irresponsible indeed — not to mention,” she gave a nasty "
"little laugh, “extremely "
dangerous half-breeds.” 
"“If you mean Professor Lupin,” piped up Dean Thomas angrily, "
“he was the best we ever —” 
“
"Hand,"
 Mr. Thomas! As I was saying — you have been introduced 
"to spells that have been complex, "
"inappropriate to your age group, and "
potentially lethal. You have been frig
htened into believing that you are 
likely to meet Dark at
tacks every other day —” 
"“No we haven’t,” Hermione said, “we just —” "
“
"Your hand is not up, Miss Granger"
!” 
Hermione put up her hand; Profe
ssor Umbridge turned away from 
her. 
“It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed il-
"legal curses in front of you, he actually performed them "
on
 you —” 
"“Well, he turned out to be a mani"
"ac, didn’t he?” said Dean Thomas "
"hotly. “Mind you, we "
still learned loads —” 
“
"Your hand is not up, Mr. Thomas"
!” trilled Professor Umbridge. 
"“Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will "
be more than sufficient to get yo
"u through your examination, which, "
"after all, is what school is all ab"
"out. And your name is?” she added, "
"staring at Parvati, whose "
hand had just shot up. 
 244 "“Parvati Patil, and isn’t there a "
practical bit in our Defense Against 
the Dark Arts O.W.L.? Aren’t we supposed to show that we can actu-
ally do the counterc
urses and things?” 
“As long as you have studied the 
"theory hard enough, there is no "
reason why you should not be able 
to perform the spells under care-
fully controlled examination condit
"ions,” said Professor Umbridge "
dismissively. 
“Without ever practicing them befo
re?” said Parvat
i incredulously. 
“Are you telling us that the first time we’ll get to do the spells will be 
during our exam?” 
"“I repeat, as long as you have st"
udied the theory hard enough —” 
“And what good’s theory going to be
 in the real world?” said Harry 
"loudly, his fist in"
 the air again. 
Professor Umbrid
ge looked up. 
"“This is school, Mr. Potter, not th"
"e real world,” she said softly. "
“So we’re not supposed to be pr
epared for what’s waiting out 
there?” 
"“There is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter.” "
“Oh yeah?” said Harry
". His temper, which seemed to have been "
bubbling just beneath the 
"surface all day, was reaching boiling point. "
“Who do you imagine wants to atta
ck children like yourselves?” 
inquired Professor Umbridge in
 a horribly honeyed voice. 
"“Hmm, let’s think . . .” said Harry in a mock thoughtful voice, "
“maybe 
Lord Voldemort
?” 
Ron gasped; Lavender Brown utte
red a little scream; Neville 
slipped sideways off his stool. Prof
"essor Umbridge, however, did not "
flinch. She was staring at Harry with 
a grimly satisfied expression on 
her face. 
"“Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.” "
The classroom was silent and still.
 Everyone was staring at either 
Umbridge or Harry. 
"“Now, let me make a few things quite plain.” "
   245 "Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned toward them, her stubby-"
fingered hands spla
yed on her desk. 
“You have been told that a certai
n Dark wizard has returned from 
the dead —” 
"“He wasn’t dead,” said Harry angr"
"ily, “but yeah, "
he’s returned!” 
“Mr.-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-House-ten-points-do-not-
"make-matters-worse-for-yourself,” "
said Professor Umbridge in one 
"breath without looking at him. “As I was saying, you have been in-"
formed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. 
This is a lie.
” 
"“It is NOT a lie!” said Harry. “I saw him, I fought him!” "
"“Detention, Mr. Potter!” said Professor Umbridge triumphantly. "
"“Tomorrow evening. Five o’clock. My office. I repeat, "
this is a lie.
 The 
Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any 
Dark wizard. If you are still worri
"ed, by all means come and see me "
outside class hours. If someone is al
arming you with fibs about reborn 
"Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it. I am here to help. I am "
"your friend. And now, you will kindly continue your reading. Page "
"five, ‘Basics for Beginners.’” "
Professor Umbridge sat down behind
" her desk again. Harry, how-"
"ever, stood up. Everyone was staring "
at him; Seamus looked half-
"scared, half-fascinated. "
"“Harry, no!” Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at "
"his sleeve, but Harry jerked "
his arm out of her reach. 
"“So, according to you, Cedric "
Diggory dropped dead of his own 
"accord, did he?” Harry as"
"ked, his voice shaking. "
There was a collective intake of br
"eath from the class, for none of "
"them, apart from Ron and Hermio"
"ne, had ever heard Harry talk "
about what had happened on the ni
ght that Cedric had died. They 
stared avidly from Harry to Pro
"fessor Umbridge, who had raised her "
eyes and was staring at him without a 
trace of a fake smile on her face. 
"“Cedric Diggory’s death was a tragic accident,” she said coldly. "
"“It was murder,” said Harry. He co"
uld feel himself shaking. He had 
 246 "hardly talked to anyone about this, "
least of all thirty eagerly listening 
classmates. “Voldemort killed
" him, and you know it.” "
Professor Umbridge’s face was 
quite blank. For a moment he 
thought she was going to scream at 
"him. Then she said, in her softest, "
"most sweetly girlish voice, “Come here, Mr. Potter, dear.” "
"He kicked his chair aside, str"
ode around Ron and Hermione and 
up to the teacher’s desk
. He could feel the rest of the class holding its 
breath. He felt so angry he did not care what happened next. 
Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of 
"her handbag, stretched it out on th"
"e desk, dipped her quill into a bot-"
"tle of ink, and started scribbling, "
hunched over so that Harry could 
not see what she was writing. Nobody
 spoke. After a minute or so she 
rolled up the parchment and tapped it
 with her wand; it sealed itself 
seamlessly so that he
 could not open it. 
“Take this to Professor McGonaga
"ll, dear,” said Professor Um-"
"bridge, holding out the note to him. "
He took it from her without sayi
"ng a word and left the room, not "
even looking back at Ron and He
"rmione, and slamming the class-"
room door shut behind 
him. He walked very fa
"st along the corridor, "
the note to McGonagall clutched ti
"ght in his hand, and turning a cor-"
ner walked slap into Peeves the Po
"ltergeist, a wide-faced little man "
floating on his back in mida
"ir, juggling several inkwells. "
"“Why, it’s Potty Wee Potter!” cack"
"led Peeves, allowing two of the "
inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the 
walls with ink; Harry jumped backwa
rd out of the way with a snarl. 
"“Get out of it, Peeves.” "
"“Oooh, Crackpot’s feeling cranky,” said Peeves, pursuing Harry "
"along the corridor, leering as he zoom"
ed along above him. “What is it 
"this time, my fine Potty friend? Hear"
ing voices? Seeing visions? Speak-
ing in” — Peeves blew a 
gigantic raspberry — “
tongues
?” 
"“I said, leave me ALONE!” Harry shouted, running down the  "
   247 "nearest flight of stairs, but Peeves me"
rely slid down the banister on his 
back beside him. 
“
"Oh, most think he’s bark"
"ing, the Potty wee lad, "
" But some are more kindly and think he’s just sad, "
 But Peevesy knows better 
and says that he’s mad
 —”
“SHUT UP!” 
A door to his left flew open an
d Professor McGonagall emerged 
from her office looking gr
im and slightly harassed. 
“What on 
earth
" are you shouting about, Potter?” she snapped, as "
Peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight. “Why aren’t you in 
class?” 
“I’ve been sent to see yo
"u,” said Harry stiffly. "
“Sent? What do yo
"u mean, sent?” "
He held out the note from Professor Umbridge. Professor McGo-
"nagall took it from him, "
"frowning, slit it open "
"with a tap of her wand, "
"stretched it out, and began to read. "
Her eyes zoomed from side to side 
behind their square spectacles as sh
"e read what Umbridge had written, "
and with each line they became narrower. 
"“Come in here, Potter.” "
He followed her inside her stud
y. The door closed automatically 
behind him. 
"“Well?” said Professor McGonagall,"
 rounding on him. “Is this 
true?” 
"“Is what true?” Harry asked, rather"
 more aggressively than he had 
intended. “Professor?” he added in 
an attempt to sound more polite. 
“Is it true that you shoute
d at Professor Umbridge?” 
"“Yes,” said Harry. "
“You called her a liar?” 
“Yes.” 
 248 “You told her He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?” 
“Yes.” 
"Professor McGonagall sat down behind her desk, frowning at Harry. "
"Then she said, “Have a biscuit, Potter.” "
“Have — what?” 
"“Have a biscuit,” she repeated impatiently, indicating a tartan tin of "
cookies lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her desk. “And sit 
down.” 
There had been a previous occasi
"on when Harry, expecting to be "
"caned by Professor McGonagall, had "
instead been appointed by her to 
the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He sa
nk into a chair opposite her and 
"helped himself to a Ginger Newt, "
feeling just as confused and wrong-
footed as he had done
 on that occasion. 
Professor McGonagall set down Pr
ofessor Umbridge’s note and 
looked very seriously at Harry. 
"“Potter, you need "
to be careful.” 
Harry swallowed his mouthful of Gi
nger Newt and stared at her. 
Her tone of voice was not at all what
" he was used to; it was not brisk, "
"crisp, and stern; it was low and "
anxious and somehow much more hu-
man than usual. 
“Misbehavior in Dolores Umbridge’s class could cost you much 
more than House points and a detention.” 
“What do you — ?” 
"“Potter, use your common sense,"
"” snapped Professor McGonagall, "
with an abrupt return to her us
ual manner. “You know where she 
"comes from, you must know to"
 whom she is reporting.” 
The bell rang for the end of the 
lesson. Overhead and all around 
came the elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move. 
"“It says here she’s given you detention every evening this week, "
"starting tomorrow,” Professor McGo"
"nagall said, looking down at Um-"
bridge’s note again. 
   249 “Every evening this week!” Harry 
"repeated, horrified. “But, Profes-"
"sor, couldn’t you — ?” "
"“No, I couldn’t,” said Pr"
ofessor McGonagall flatly. 
“But —” 
“She is your teacher and has every 
right to give you detention. You 
will go to her room at five o’clock 
tomorrow for the first one. Just re-
member: Tread carefully ar
ound Dolores Umbridge.” 
“But I was telling the truth!” sa
"id Harry, outraged. “Voldemort’s "
"back, you know he is, Professo"
r Dumbledore knows he is —” 
"“For heaven’s sake, Potter!” said Professor McGonagall, straighten-"
ing her glasses angrily (she had wi
nced horribly when he had used 
Voldemort’s name). “Do you really thin
k this is about truth or lies? It’s 
about keeping your head down an
d your temper 
under control!” 
"She stood up, nostrils wide and mo"
"uth very thin, and he stood too. "
"“Have another biscuit,” she said irritably, thrusting the tin at him. "
"“No, thanks,” said Harry coldly. "
"“Don’t be ridiculous,” she snapped. "
He took one. 
"“Thanks,” he said grudgingly. "
“Didn’t you listen to Dolores Umbr
idge’s speech at the start-of-
"term feast, Potter?” "
"“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah . . . she sa"
id . . . progress will be prohib-
"ited or . . . well, it meant that . . "
. that the Ministry of
 Magic is trying 
to interfere at Hogwarts.” 
Professor McGonagall eyed hi
"m for a moment, then sniffed, "
"walked around her desk, and "
held open the door for him. 
"“Well, I’m glad you listen to He"
"rmione Granger at any rate,” she "
"said, pointing him out of her office. "
inner in the Great Hall that ni
ght was not a pleasant experi-
ence for Harry. The news about 
his shouting match with 
Umbridge seemed to ha
ve traveled exceptionally fast even by Hog-
warts standards. He heard whispers all around him as he sat eating 
between Ron and Hermione. The funny
 thing was that none of the 
whisperers seemed to mind him ov
erhearing what they were saying 
about him — on the contra
"ry, it was as though they were hoping he "
"would get angry and start shouting again, so that they could hear his "
story firsthand. 
“He says he saw Cedric 
Diggory murdered. . . .” 
“He reckons he dueled wi
th You-Know-Who. . . .” 
“Come off it. . . .” 
“Who does he think he’s kidding?” 
“Pur-
lease
 . . .” 
"“What I don’t get,” said Harry in "
"a shaking voice, laying down his "
knife and fork (his hands were tr
embling too much to hold them 
"steady), “is why they all believed"
 the story two months ago when 
Dumbledore told them. . . .” 
D 
   251 "“The thing is, Harry, I’m not sure they did,” said Hermione "
"grimly. “Oh, let’s get out of here.” "
She slammed down her own knife and 
fork; Ron looked sadly at his 
half-finished apple pie but followed su
it. People stared at them all the 
way out of the Hall. 
"“What d’you mean, you’re not sure they believed Dumbledore?” "
Harry asked Hermione when they 
reached the first-floor landing. 
"“Look, you don’t understand what "
"it was like after it happened,” "
said Hermione quietly. “You arrive
d back in the middle of the lawn 
clutching Cedric’s dead body. . . 
. None of us saw what happened in 
the maze. . . . We just had Dumble
dore’s word for it that You-Know-
Who had come back and kille
d Cedric and 
fought you.” 
“Which is the truth!
” said Harry loudly. 
"“I know it is, Harry, so will you "
please
 stop biting my head off?” 
said Hermione wearily. “It’s just th
"at before the truth could sink in, "
"everyone went home for the summer, where they spent two months "
reading about how you’re
 a nutcase and Dumbledore’s going senile!” 
Rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty 
corridors back to Gryffindor Tower. Harry felt as though his first day 
"had lasted a week, but he still had "
a mountain of homework to do be-
fore bed. A dull pounding pain was 
developing over his right eye. He 
glanced out of a rain-washed window at the dark grounds as they turned 
into the Fat Lady’s corridor. There was 
still no light in Hagrid’s cabin. 
“
"Mimbulus mimbletonia,"
"” said Hermione, before the Fat Lady "
could ask. The portrait swung open 
to reveal the hole behind and the 
three of them scrambled back through it. 
The common room was almost empt
y; nearly everyone was still 
down at dinner. Crookshanks uncoiled
 himself from an armchair and 
"trotted to meet them, purring lo"
"udly, and when Harry, Ron, and "
Hermione took their three favorite 
chairs at the fireside he leapt 
lightly into Hermione’s lap and curl
ed up there like a furry ginger 
cushion. Harry gazed into the flam
"es, feeling drained and exhausted. "
 252 “
How
 can Dumbledore have let this
 happen?” Hermione cried sud-
"denly, making Harry and Ron jump; "
"Crookshanks leapt off her, look-"
ing affronted. She pounded the arms of
" her chair in fury, so that bits "
of stuffing leaked out 
of the holes. “How can he let that terrible 
woman teach us? And in 
our O.W.L. year too!” 
"“Well, we’ve never had great Defense Against the Dark Arts teach-"
"ers, have we?” said Harry. “You know"
" what it’s like, Hagrid told us, "
"nobody wants the job, they say it’s jinxed.” "
"“Yes, but to employ someone who’s "
actually refusing to let us do 
magic! 
What’s
 Dumbledore playing at?” 
“And she’s trying to get people to
" spy for her,” said Ron darkly. “Re-"
member when she said she wanted us 
to come and tell her if we hear 
anyone saying You-Know-Who’s back?” 
"“Of course she’s here to spy on us all, that’s obvious, why else would "
Fudge have wanted her to come?” snapped Hermione. 
"“Don’t start arguing again,” said"
" Harry wearily, as Ron opened his "
mouth to retaliate. “Can’t we just 
". . . Let’s just do that homework, get "
it out of the way. . . .” 
They collected their schoolbags fr
om a corner and returned to the 
chairs by the fire. People were co
ming back from dinner now. Harry 
kept his face averted from the port
"rait hole, but could still sense the "
stares he was attracting. 
“Shall we do Snape’s st
"uff first?” said Ron, "
dipping his quill into 
his ink. “‘
The properties
 . . . 
of moonstone
 . . . 
and its uses
 . . .
 in potion-
making
 . . .’” he
"muttered, writing the word"
s across the top of his 
"parchment as he spoke them. “There.” He underlined the title, then "
looked up expectan
tly at Hermione. 
“So what are the properties of m
oonstone and its uses in potion-
making?” 
But Hermione was not listening; she 
was squinting over into the far 
"corner of the room, where Fred, Ge"
"orge, and Lee Jordan were now sit-"
"ting at the center of a knot of innocent-looking first years, all of whom "
   253 were chewing something that seemed 
to have come out of a large pa-
per bag that Fred was holding. 
"“No, I’m sorry, they’ve gone too fa"
"r,” she said, standing up and "
"looking positively furious. “Come on, Ron.” "
"“I — what?” said Ron, plainly "
"playing for time. “No — come on, "
Hermione — we can’t te
ll them off for giving
 out sweets. . . .” 
“You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat 
or — or Puking Pastilles or —” 
“Fainting Fancies?” Ha
rry suggested quietly. 
"One by one, as though hit over th"
"e heads with invisible mallets, the "
first years were slumping unconscious in their seats; some slid right 
"onto the floor, others merely hung ov"
"er the arms of their chairs, their "
tongues lolling out. Most of the people watching were laughing; Her-
"mione, however, squared her should"
ers and marched directly over to 
where Fred and George now stood wi
"th clipboards, closely observing "
"the unconscious first years. Ron rose halfway out of his chair, hovered "
"uncertainly for a moment or two, "
"then muttered to Harry, “She’s got "
"it under control,” before sinking as "
low in his chair as his lanky frame 
permitted. 
“That’s enough!” Hermione said fo
"rcefully to Fred and George, "
both of whom looked up in mild surprise. 
"“Yeah, you’re right,” said Ge"
"orge, nodding, “t"
his dosage looks 
"strong enough, doesn’t it?” "
"“I told you this morning, you can’"
t test your rubbi
sh on students!” 
“We’re paying them!” sa
id Fred indignantly. 
"“I don’t care, it could be dangerous!” "
"“Rubbish,” said Fred. "
"“Calm down, Hermione, they’re fine!"
” said Lee reassuringly as he 
"walked from first year to first year, inserting purple sweets into their "
open mouths. 
"“Yeah, look, they’re coming"
" round now,” said George. "
A few of the first years were indeed stirring. Several looked so 
 254 shocked to find themselv
"es lying on the floor, or dangling off their "
"chairs, that Harry was sure Fred "
and George had not warned them 
what the sweets were going to do. 
“Feel all right?” said George kindly
 to a small dark-haired girl lying 
at his feet. 
"“I-I think so,” she said shakily. "
"“Excellent,” said Fred happily,"
 but the next seco
nd Hermione had 
snatched both his clipboard and th
e paper bag of Fainting Fancies 
from his hands. 
“It is NOT excellent!” 
"“’Course it is, they’re alive, aren’t they?” said Fred angrily. "
"“You can’t do this, what"
 if you made one of
 them really ill?” 
“We’re not going to make
" them ill, we’ve alread"
y tested them all on 
"ourselves, this is just to see "
if everyone reacts the same —” 
"“If you don’t stop doing it, I’m going to —” "
“Put us in detention?” said Fred in 
an I’d-like-to-see-you-try-it voice. 
“Make us write lines?” 
"said George, smirking. "
Onlookers all over the room were 
laughing. Hermione drew herself 
up to her full height; her eyes 
were narrowed and her bushy hair 
seemed to crackle with electricity. 
"“No,” she said, her voice quivering "
"with anger, “but I will write to "
your mother.” 
"“You wouldn’t,” said George, horrified, taking a step back from her. "
"“Oh, yes, I would,” said Hermione "
grimly. “I can’t stop you eating 
"the stupid things yourselves, but you’"
re not giving them to first years.” 
Fred and George looked thunderstruc
k. It was clear that as far as 
"they were concerned, Hermione’s th"
reat was way belo
w the belt. With 
"a last threatening look at them, she "
thrust Fred’s clipboard and the bag 
of Fancies back into his 
arms and stalked back to her chair by the fire. 
Ron was now so low in his seat that
 his nose was roughly level with 
his knees. 
   255 "“Thank you for your support, Ron,” Hermione said acidly. "
"“You handled it fine by yourself,” Ron mumbled. "
Hermione stared down at her blan
k piece of parchment for a few 
"seconds, then said edgily"
", “Oh, it’s no good, I "
can’t concentrate now. 
I’m going to bed.” 
She wrenched her bag open; Harry thought she was about to put 
"her books away, but in"
stead she pulled out two misshapen woolly ob-
"jects, placed them carefully on a ta"
"ble by the fireplace, covered them "
with a few screwed-up bits of pa
"rchment and a broken quill, and "
stood back to admire the effect. 
“What in the name of Merlin are 
"you doing?” said Ron, watching "
her as though fearful for her sanity. 
"“They’re hats for house-elves,” she said briskly, now stuffing her "
books back into her bag. “I did th
em over the summer. I’m a really 
"slow knitter without magic, but now I’m back at school I should be "
able to make lots more.” 
“You’re leaving out hats for the house-elves?” said Ron slowly. “And 
you’re covering them up
 with rubbish first?” 
"“Yes,” said Hermione defiantly, swinging her bag onto her back. "
"“That’s not on,” said Ron angrily. "
“You’re trying to trick them into 
picking up the hats. You’re settin
g them free when they might not 
want to be free.” 
“Of course they want to be free!
"” said Hermione at once, though "
"her face was turning pink. “Don’t you dare touch those hats, Ron!” "
She left. Ron waited until she ha
d disappeared through the door to 
"the girls’ dormitories, "
then cleared the rubbish
 off the woolly hats. 
“They should at least see what they
"’re picking up,” he said firmly. "
“Anyway . . .” He rolled up the 
parchment on which he had written 
the title of Snape’s essay. “There’s no
 point trying to fi
"nish this now, I "
"can’t do it without Hermione, I hav"
en’t got a clue what you’re sup-
posed to do with m
"oonstones, have you?” "
 256 "Harry shook his head, noticing as he"
 did so that the ache in his 
right temple was getting worse. He thought of the long essay on giant 
wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply. Knowing perfectly well that 
he would regret not finishing his 
homework tonight when the morn-
"ing came, he piled his bo"
oks back into his bag. 
“I’m going to bed too.” 
He passed Seamus on the way to
 the door leading to the dormi-
"tories, but did not look at him. Ha"
rry had a fleeting impression that 
"Seamus had opened his mouth to speak, but sped up, and reached the "
soothing peace of the stone spiral 
staircase without having to endure 
any more provocation. 
The following day dawned just as 
leaden and rainy as the previous 
one. Hagrid was still absent from
 the staff table at breakfast. 
"“But on the plus side, no Snape today,” said Ron bracingly. "
Hermione yawned widely and po
ured herself some coffee. She 
"looked mildly pleased about something, and when Ron asked her "
"what she had to be so happy about, she simply said, “The hats have "
gone. Seems the house-elves 
do want freedom after all.” 
"“I wouldn’t bet on it,” Ron told"
 her cuttingly. “They might not 
count as clothes. They didn’t look 
"anything like hats to me, more like "
woolly bladders.” 
Hermione did not speak to him all morning. 
Double Charms was succeeded by double Transfiguration. Profes-
sor Flitwick and Professor McGonaga
ll both spent the first fifteen 
minutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of 
O.W.L.s. 
"“What you must remember,” said li"
ttle Professor Flitwick squeak-
"ily, perched as ever on a pile of bo"
oks so that he could see over the top 
"of his desk, “is that these examinat"
ions may influence your futures for 
many years to come! If you have no
t already given serious thought to 
"your careers, now is the time to"
" do so. And in the meantime, I’m "
   257 "afraid, we shall be working harder th"
an ever to ensure that you all do 
yourselves justice!” 
"They then spent more than an hour reviewing Summoning Charms, "
which according to Professor Flitwick
 were bound to come up in their 
"O.W.L., and he rounded off the lesso"
n by setting them their largest 
amount of Charms homework ever. 
"It was the same, if not wo"
"rse, in Transfiguration. "
"“You cannot pass an O.W.L.,” sa"
"id Professor McGonagall grimly, "
"“without serious application, practice, and study. I see no reason why "
everybody in this class should not ac
hieve an O.W.L. in Transfiguration 
as long as they put in the work.”
 Neville made a sa
d little disbeliev-
"ing noise. “Yes, you too, Longbo"
"ttom,” said Profe"
ssor McGonagall. 
“There’s nothing wrong with your wo
rk except lack of confidence. So 
. . . today we are starting Vanishin
g Spells. These are easier than Con-
"juring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until N.E.W.T. "
"level, but they are still among th"
e most difficult magic you will be 
tested on in your O.W.L.” 
She was quite right; Harry found th
e Vanishing Spells horribly dif-
"ficult. By the end of a double period, neither he nor Ron had managed "
to vanish the snails on
" which they were practicing, though Ron said "
hopefully that he thought his look
"ed a bit paler. Hermione, on the "
"other hand, successfully vanished her "
"snail on the third attempt, earn-"
ing her a ten-point bonus for Gryffi
ndor from Professor McGonagall. 
She was the only person not given 
homework; everybody else was told 
"to practice the spell overnight, read"
y for a fresh attempt on their snails 
the following afternoon. 
Now panicking slightly about the 
amount of homework they had 
"to do, Harry and Ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up "
the uses of moonstones in potion-m
aking. Still angry about Ron’s slur 
"on her woolly hats, Hermione did not join them. By the time they "
reached Care of Magical Creatures 
"in the afternoon, "
Harry’s head was 
aching again. 
 258 The day had become cool and bree
"zy, and, as they walked down "
the sloping lawn toward Hagrid’s ca
bin on the edge of the Forbidden 
"Forest, they felt the occasional drop "
of rain on their faces. Professor 
Grubbly-Plank stood waiting for the 
class some ten yards from Ha-
"grid’s front door, a long trestle table in front of her laden with many "
twigs. As Harry and Ron reached he
"r, a loud shout of laughter "
"sounded behind them; turning, they"
 saw Draco Malfoy striding to-
"ward them, surrounded by his usual ga"
ng of Slytherin cronies. He had 
clearly just said something highly 
"amusing, because Crabbe, Goyle, "
"Pansy Parkinson, and the rest contin"
ued to snigger heartily as they 
gathered around the trestle table. Ju
dging by the fact 
that all of them 
"kept looking over at Harry, he was ab"
le to guess the su
bject of the joke 
without too much difficulty. 
“Everyone here?” barked Professo
"r Grubbly-Plank, once all the "
Slytherins and Gryffindors had arri
ved. “Let’s crack on then — who 
can tell me what these things are called?” 
She indicated the heap of twigs in
 front of her. Hermione’s hand 
shot into the air. Behind her back
", Malfoy did a buck-toothed imita-"
tion of her jumping up and down in
 eagerness to answer a question. 
Pansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laug
hter that turned almost at once 
"into a scream, as the twigs on the ta"
ble leapt into the air and revealed 
themselves to be what looked like
 tiny pixieish creatures made of 
"wood, each with knobbly brown arms "
"and legs, two twiglike fingers at "
"the end of each hand, and a funny, fl"
"at, barklike face in which a pair "
of beetle-brown eyes glittered. 
“Oooooh!” said Parvati and Lavender
", thoroughly irritating Harry: "
Anyone would have thought that Ha
grid never showed them impres-
sive creatures; admittedly the flob
"berworms had been a bit dull, but "
the salamanders and hippogriffs ha
"d been interesting enough, and the "
Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so. 
"“Kindly keep your voices down, "
girls!” said Professor Grubbly-
"Plank sharply, scattering a handful "
of what looked like brown rice 
   259 "among the stick-creatures, who "
immediately fell upon the food. 
“So — anyone know the names of 
these creatures? Miss Granger?” 
"“Bowtruckles,” said Hermione. “T"
"hey’re tree-guardians, usually "
live in wand-trees.” 
"“Five points for Gryffindor,” said "
"Professor Grubbly-Plank. “Yes, these "
"are bowtruckles and, as Miss Granger rightly says, they generally live in "
trees whose wood is of wand qualit
y. Anybody know 
what they eat?” 
"“Wood lice,” said Hermione prompt"
"ly, which explained why what "
Harry had taken for grains of brown ri
ce were moving. “But fairy eggs 
if they can get them.” 
"“Good girl, take another five points"
. So whenever you need leaves 
or wood from a tree in which a bowtruck
"le lodges, it is "
wise to have a 
gift of wood lice ready to distract
 or placate it. Th
ey may not look 
"dangerous, but if angered they wi"
ll gouge out human eyes with their 
"fingers, which, as you can see, ar"
e very sharp and not at all desirable 
near the eyeballs. So if you’d like to
" gather closer, take a few wood lice "
and a bowtruckle — I have enough
 here for one between three — you 
can study them more closely. I want 
a sketch from each
 of you with all 
body parts labeled by th
e end of the lesson.” 
The class surged forward around the trestle table. Harry deliberately 
circled around the back so that he
 ended up right ne
xt to Professor 
Grubbly-Plank. 
"“Where’s Hagrid?” he asked her, while everyone else was choosing "
bowtruckles. 
"“Never you mind,” said Profes"
"sor Grubbly-Plank repressively, "
which had been her attitude last time
 Hagrid had failed to turn up for 
a class too. Smirking all over his 
"pointed face, Draco Malfoy leaned "
across Harry and seized 
the largest bowtruckle. 
"“Maybe,” said Malfoy in an unde"
"rtone, so that only Harry could "
"hear him, “the stupid great oaf’s got himself badly injured.” "
“Maybe you will if you don’t shut 
"up,” said Harry out of the side of "
his mouth. 
 260 “Maybe he’s been messing with stuff that’s too 
big
" for him, if you "
get my drift.” 
"Malfoy walked away, smirking over his shoulder at Harry, who sud-"
denly felt sick. Did Malfoy know 
something? His father was a Death 
"Eater, after all; what if he had information about Hagrid’s fate that "
had not yet reached the Order’s ea
rs? He hurried back around the 
"table to Ron and Hermione, who we"
re squatting on the grass some 
distance away and attempting to pers
uade a bowtruckle to remain still 
"long enough to draw it. Harry pulled out parchment and quill, "
"crouched down beside the others, "
and related in a whisper what Mal-
foy had just said. 
“Dumbledore would know if some
"thing had happened to Hagrid,” "
said Hermione at once. “It’s just pl
aying into Malfoy’s hands to look 
"worried, it tells him we don’t know "
exactly what’s going on. We’ve got 
"to ignore him, Harry. Here, hold "
"the bowtruckle for a moment, just "
so I can draw its face. . . .” 
"“Yes,” came Malfoy’s clear draw"
"l from the group nearest them, "
"“Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you "
"know, and it sounds as though the Ministry’s really determined to "
crack down on substandard teaching in 
this place. So even if that over-
grown moron 
does
" show up again, he’ll probably be sent packing "
straight away.” 
“OUCH!” 
Harry had gripped the bowtruckle 
so hard that it had almost 
snapped; it had just taken a great re
taliatory swipe at his hand with its 
"sharp fingers, leaving two long d"
eep cuts there. Harry dropped it; 
"Crabbe and Goyle, who had already "
been guffawing at the idea of Ha-
"grid being sacked, laughed still harder"
 as the bowtruckle set off at full 
"tilt toward the forest, "
"a little, moving stickman soon swallowed up by "
the tree roots. When the 
bell echoed distantly over the grounds Harry 
rolled up his bloodstained bowtruck
le picture and marched off to  
   261 Herbology with his hand wrapped 
in a handkerchief of Hermione’s 
and Malfoy’s derisive laughter
 still ringing in his ears. 
“If he calls Hagrid a moron one mo
re time . . .” 
snarled Harry. 
"“Harry, don’t go picking a row with"
" Malfoy, don’t forget, he’s a pre-"
"fect now, he could make li"
fe difficult for you. . . .” 
"“Wow, I wonder what it’d be like to"
 have a difficult life?” said Harry 
"sarcastically. Ron laughed, but "
Hermione frowned. Together they 
traipsed across the vegetable patch. 
The sky still appeared unable to 
make up its mind whether it
 wanted to rain or not. 
“I just wish Hagrid would hurry up
" and get back, that’s all,” said "
"Harry in a low voice, as they "
reached the greenhouses. “And 
don’t
 say 
that Grubbly-Plank woman’s a better teacher!” he added threateningly. 
"“I wasn’t going to,” "
said Hermione calmly. 
“Because she’ll never be
" as good as Hagrid,” "
"said Harry firmly, fully "
aware that he had just experienced
 an exemplary Care of Magical 
Creatures lesson and was thor
oughly annoyed about it. 
The door of the nearest greenhous
e opened and some fourth years 
"spilled out of it, "
including Ginny. 
"“Hi,” she said brightly as she passed. A few seconds later, Luna "
"Lovegood emerged, trailing behind th"
"e rest of the class, a smudge of "
earth on her nose and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head. 
"When she saw Harry, her prominent ey"
es seemed to bulge excitedly 
and she made a beeline straight for him. Many of his classmates 
turned curiously to watch. Luna 
"took a great breath and then said, "
without so much as a preliminar
y hello: “I believe He-Who-Must-
"Not-Be-Named is back, and I believe you fought him and escaped "
from him.” 
"“Er — right,” said Harry awkwar"
dly. Luna was wearing what 
"looked like a pair of orange radishes for earrings, a fact that Parvati "
"and Lavender seemed to have noticed,"
 as they were both giggling and 
pointing at her earlobes. 
 262 "“You can laugh!” Luna said, her vo"
"ice rising, apparently under the "
impression that Parvat
i and Lavender were la
ughing at what she had 
said rather than what she was wearing. “But people used to believe there 
were no such things as the Bli
bbering Humdinger or the Crumple-
Horned Snorkack!” 
"“Well, they were right, weren’t "
they?” said Herm
ione impatiently. 
“There 
weren’t
 any such things as the Bl
ibbering Humdinger or the 
Crumple-Horned Snorkack.” 
Luna gave her a withering look an
"d flounced away, radishes swing-"
ing madly. Parvati and Lavender were
 not the only ones hooting with 
laughter now. 
“D’you mind not offending the only people who believe me?” 
Harry asked Hermione as they made their way into class. 
"“Oh, for heaven’s sake, Ha"
"rry, you can do better than "
"her,"
” said 
"Hermione. “Ginny’s told me all about her, apparently she’ll only be-"
"lieve in things as long as there’s no proof at all. Well, I wouldn’t expect "
anything else from someone whose father runs 
The Quibbler.
” 
Harry thought of the sinister wing
ed horses he had seen on the 
night he had arrived and how Luna 
had said she could see them too. 
His spirits sank slightly. Had she b
een lying? But before he could de-
vote much more thought to the ma
"tter, Ernie Macmillan had stepped "
up to him. 
"“I want you to know, Potter,” he sa"
"id in a loud, carrying voice, “that "
it’s not only weirdos who support you. I personally believe you one 
hundred percent. My family have 
always stood firm behind Dumble-
"dore, and so do I.” "
"“Er — thanks very much, Ernie,” said Harry, taken aback but "
pleased. Ernie might be pompous on
" occasions like these, but Harry "
was in a mood to deeply appreciate
 a vote of confidence from some-
body who was not wearing radishes 
in their ears. Ernie’s words had 
certainly wiped the smile from Lav
"ender Brown’s face and, as he  "
   263 "turned to talk to Ron and Hermione, Harry caught Seamus’s expres-"
"sion, which looked both confused and defiant. "
"To nobody’s surprise, Professor Sp"
rout started their lesson by lec-
turing them about the importance 
of O.W.L.s. Harry wished all the 
teachers would stop doing this; he 
"was starting to get an anxious, "
twisted feeling in his stomach ever
y time he remembered how much 
"homework he had to do, a feeling "
that worsened dramatically when 
Professor Sprout gave them yet anothe
r essay at the end of class. Tired 
and smelling strongly 
"of dragon dung, Professor Sprout’s preferred "
"brand of fertilizer, the Gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an "
"hour and a half later, none of them"
 talking very much; it had been an-
other long day. 
"As Harry was starving, and he ha"
d his first detention with Um-
"bridge at five o’clock, he headed "
straight for dinner without dropping 
off his bag in Gryffindor Tower so 
that he could bolt something down 
before facing whatever she had in store for him. He had barely reached 
"the entrance of the Great Hall, however, when a loud and angry voice "
"said, “Oy, Potter!” "
"“What now?” he muttered wearily, "
turning to face Angelina John-
"son, who looked as though she was in a towering temper. "
"“I’ll tell you what now,” she said, marching straight up to him and "
poking him hard in the chest with her finger. “How come you’ve 
landed yourself in detention 
for five o’clock on Friday?” 
“What?” said Harry. “Why . . 
". oh yeah, Keeper tryouts!” "
“
Now
 he remembers!” snarled Angelina
. “Didn’t I tell you I wanted 
to do a tryout with the 
"whole team,"
 and find someone who 
fitted in 
with everyone
? Didn’t I tell you I’d book
ed the Quidditch pitch spe-
cially? And now you’ve decided yo
u’re not going to be there!” 
“I didn’t decide not to be there!
"” said Harry, stung by the injustice "
of these words. “I got detention fr
"om that Umbridge woman, just be-"
cause I told her the truth about You-Know-Who —” 
 264 "“Well, you can just go straight to"
 her and ask her to let you off on 
"Friday,” said Angelina fiercely, “an"
"d I don’t care how you do it, tell her "
You-Know-Who’s a figment of your
 imagination if 
"you like, just "
make 
sure you’re there
!” 
She stormed away. 
“You know what?” Harry said to Ron and Hermione as they en-
tered the Great Hall. “I think we
’d better check with Puddlemere 
United whether Oliver Wood’s been 
"killed during a training session, "
because she seems to be 
channeling his spirit.” 
“What d’you reckon are the odds of
 Umbridge letting you off on 
"Friday?” said Ron skeptically, as they sat down at the Gryffindor table. "
"“Less than zero,” said Harry glum"
"ly, tipping lamb chops onto his "
plate and starting to eat.
" “Better try, though, hadn"
’t I? I’ll offer to do 
"two more detentions or something, I dunno. . . .” He swallowed a "
"mouthful of potato and added, “I "
hope she doesn’t keep me too long 
this evening. You realize we’ve got to
" write three essays, practice Van-"
"ishing Spells for McGonagall, work "
"out a countercharm for Flitwick, "
"finish the bowtruckle drawing, and "
start that stupid dream diary for 
Trelawney?” 
Ron moaned and for so
me reason glanced up
 at the ceiling. 
“
And
 it looks like it’s going to rain.” 
“What’s that got to do with ou
"r homework?” said Hermione, her "
eyebrows raised. 
"“Nothing,” said Ron at on"
"ce, his ears reddening. "
At five to five Harry bade the other two good-bye and set off for 
Umbridge’s office on the third fl
oor. When he knocked on the door 
"she said, “Come in,” in a sugary voice. He entered cautiously, looking "
around. 
He had known this office under thr
ee of its previous occupants. In 
the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had 
lived here it had been plastered 
"in beaming portraits of its owner. When Lupin had occupied it, it was "
likely you would meet some fascinat
ing Dark creature in a cage or 
   265 tank if you came to call. In the 
impostor Moody’s days it had been 
packed with various instruments an
d artifacts for the detection of 
wrongdoing and concealment. 
"Now, however, it looked totally "
unrecognizable. The surfaces had 
all been draped in lacy covers and 
cloths. There were several vases full 
"of dried flowers, each residing on"
" its own doily, and on one of the "
walls was a collection of ornament
"al plates, each decorated with a "
large technicolor kitten wearing 
a different bow around its neck. 
These were so foul that Harry stared
" at them, transfixed, until Profes-"
sor Umbridge spoke again. 
"“Good evening, Mr. Potter.” "
Harry started and looked around. He
 had not noticed her at first 
because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended 
only too well with 
the tablecloth on th
e desk behind her. 
"“Evening,” Harry said stiffly. "
"“Well, sit down,” she said, pointing"
 toward a small table draped in 
lace beside which she had drawn up 
a straight-backed chair. A piece of 
blank parchment lay on the tabl
"e, apparently waiting for him. "
"“Er,” said Harry, without movi"
ng. “Professor Umbridge? Er — 
"before we start, I-I wanted "
to ask you a . . . a favor.” 
Her bulging eyes narrowed. 
“Oh yes?” 
“Well I’m . . . I’m on the Gryffi
ndor Quidditch team. And I was 
supposed to be at the tryouts for th
e new Keeper at five o’clock on Fri-
day and I was — was wondering whet
her I could skip detention that 
night and do it — do it anothe
r night . . . instead . . .” 
He knew long before he reached th
e end of his sentence that it was 
no good. 
"“Oh no,” said Umbridge, smiling "
so widely that she looked as 
though she had just swallowed a part
"icularly juicy fly. “Oh no, no, no. "
This is your punishment for spread
"ing evil, nasty, attention-seeking "
"stories, Mr. Potter, and punishments "
certainly cannot be adjusted to 
 266 suit the guilty one’s convenience. 
"No, you will come here at five "
"o’clock tomorrow, and the next day, and on Friday too, and you will "
do your detentions as planned. I thin
k it rather a good thing that you 
are missing something you really want
 to do. It ought to reinforce the 
lesson I am trying to teach you.” 
Harry felt the blood surge to his he
ad and heard a thumping noise 
in his ears. So he told
" evil, nasty, attention-seeking stories, did he? "
She was watching him with her head 
"slightly to one side, still smil-"
"ing widely, as though she knew exactly what he was thinking and was "
waiting to see whether he would star
t shouting again. With a massive 
"effort Harry looked away from her, dropped his schoolbag beside the "
straight-backed chai
"r, and sat down. "
"“There,” said Umbridge sweetly, “we’"
re getting better at controlling 
"our temper already, aren’t we? Now,"
 you are going to be doing some 
"lines for me, Mr. Potter. "
"No, not with your quill,” she added, as Harry "
bent down to open his bag.
 “You’re going to be using a rather special 
one of mine. Here you are.” 
"She handed him a long, thin blac"
k quill with an unusually sharp 
point. 
“I want you to write ‘
"I must not tell lies,"
’” she told him softly. 
"“How many times?” Harry asked, wi"
th a creditable imitation of 
politeness. 
"“Oh, as long as it takes for the message to "
"sink in,"
” said Umbridge 
sweetly. “Off you go.” 
"She moved over to her desk, sat "
"down, and bent over a stack of "
parchment that looked like essays 
for marking. Harry 
raised the sharp 
black quill and then realized what was missing. 
"“You haven’t given me any ink,” he said. "
"“Oh, you won’t need ink,” said Pr"
ofessor Umbridge with the mer-
est suggestion of a la
ugh in her voice. 
Harry placed the point of the qu
ill on the paper and wrote: 
I must 
not tell lies.
   267 He let out a gasp of pain. The 
words had appeared on the parch-
"ment in what appeared to be shining red ink. At the same time, the "
words had appeared on the back of
" Harry’s right hand, cut into his "
skin as though traced there by a sc
alpel — yet even as he stared at the 
"shining cut, the skin healed over again, leaving the place where it had "
been slightly redder than 
before but quite smooth. 
Harry looked around at Umbrid
"ge. She was watching him, her "
"wide, toadlike mouth st"
retched in a smile. 
“Yes?” 
"“Nothing,” said Harry quietly. "
He looked back at th
"e parchment, placed the quill upon it once "
"more, wrote "
"I must not tell lies,"
 and felt the searing pain on the back of 
his hand for a second time; once ag
ain the words had been cut into his 
"skin, once again they heal"
ed over seconds later. 
And on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the words on the 
parchment in what he soon came to
" realize was not ink, but his own "
blood. And again and again the words 
were cut into the back of his 
"hand, healed, and then reappeared the next time he set quill to "
parchment. 
Darkness fell outside Umbridge’s window. Harry did not ask when 
he would be allowed to stop. He 
did not even check his watch. He 
knew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not go-
"ing to show any, not even if he had "
"to sit here all night, cutting open "
his own hand with this quill. . . . 
"“Come here,” she said, af"
ter what seemed hours. 
He stood up. His hand was stingi
ng painfully. When he looked 
down at it he saw that the cut had 
"healed, but that th"
e skin there was 
red raw. 
"“Hand,” she said. "
He extended it. She took it in her own. Harry repressed a shudder 
as she touched him with 
"her thick, stubby fing"
ers on which she wore 
a number of ugly old rings. 
 268 "“Tut, tut, I don’t seem to have ma"
"de much of an impression yet,” "
"she said, smiling. “Well, we’ll ju"
st have to try again tomorrow 
"evening, won’t we? You may go.” "
Harry left her office without a word
. The school was quite deserted; 
it was surely past midnight. He wa
"lked slowly up the corridor then, "
when he had turned the corner and was sure that she would not hear 
"him, broke into a run. "
He had not had time to practice 
"Vanishing Spells, had not written a "
"single dream in his dream diary, an"
d had not finished the drawing of 
"the bowtruckle, nor had he written "
his essays. He skipped breakfast 
next morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Div-
"ination, their first lesson, and was surprised to find a disheveled Ron "
keeping him company. 
“How come you didn’t do it last ni
"ght?” Harry asked, as Ron stared "
wildly around the common room fo
"r inspiration. Ron, who had been "
"fast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered some-"
"thing about “doing other stuff,” be"
"nt low over his parchment, and "
scrawled a few words. 
"“That’ll have to do,” he said, slam"
"ming the diary shut, “I’ve said I "
dreamed I was buying a new pair of
" shoes, she can’t make anything "
"weird out of that, can she?” "
They hurried off to North Tower together. 
"“How was detention with Umbridge, anyway? What did she make "
you do?” 
Harry hesitated for a fr
"action of a second, then said, “Lines.” "
"“That’s not too bad, th"
"en, eh?” said Ron. "
"“Nope,” said Harry. "
“Hey — I forgot — did she 
let you off for Friday?” 
"“No,” said Harry. "
Ron groaned sympathetically. 
It was another bad day for Harry; he was one of the worst in Trans-
   269 "figuration, not having practiced Vanish"
ing Spells at all. He had to give 
"up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle, and "
"meanwhile, Professors McGonagall, "
"Grubbly-Plank, and Sinistra gave "
"them yet more homework, which he ha"
d no prospect of finishing that 
evening because of his second detent
"ion with Umbridge. To cap it all, "
Angelina Johnson tracked him down at
" dinner again and, on learning "
that he would not be able to attend
" Friday’s Keeper tryouts, told him "
she was not at all impressed by his at
titude and that she expected play-
ers who wished to remain on the team to put training before their 
other commitments. 
“I’m in detention!” 
Harry yelled after her as she stalked away. 
“D’you think I’d rather be stuck in 
a room with that 
old toad or play-
ing Quidditch?” 
"“At least it’s only lines,” said "
"Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank "
back onto his bench and looked dow
"n at his steak-and-kidney pie, "
which he no longer fancied very much
. “It’s not as if it’s a dreadful 
"punishment, really. . . .” "
"Harry opened his mouth, closed it "
"again, and nodded. He was not "
really sure why he was not tellin
g Ron and Hermione exactly what was 
happening in Umbridge’s room: He 
only knew that he did not want 
to see their looks of horror; that
 would make the 
whole thing seem 
worse and therefore more difficult to 
face. He also felt dimly that this 
"was between himself and Umbridge, a "
"private battle of wills, and he "
was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had com-
plained about it. 
“I can’t believe how much ho
"mework we’ve got,” said Ron "
miserably. 
"“Well, why didn’t you do any last night?” Hermione asked him. "
“Where were you anyway?” 
“I was . . . I fancied a wa
"lk,” said Ron shiftily. "
Harry had the distinct impression 
that he was not alone in con-
cealing things at the moment. 
 270 ' '
The second detention was just as bad 
as the previous one. The skin on 
the back of Harry’s hand became ir
"ritated more quickly now, red and "
inflamed; Harry thought it unlikely to
 keep healing as effectively for 
long. Soon the cut would remain et
ched in his hand and Umbridge 
"would, perhaps, be satisfied. He le"
"t no moan of pain escape him, how-"
"ever, and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his "
"dismissal, again past "
"midnight, he said no"
thing but “Good evening” 
and “Good night.” 
"His homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when "
"he returned to the Gryffindor common room he did not, though ex-"
"hausted, go to bed, but opened "
his books and began Snape’s moon-
stone essay. It was half-past two by
 the time he had finished it. He 
knew he had done a poor 
"job, but there was no help for it; unless he "
had something to give in he would 
be in detention with Snape next. 
He then dashed off answers to th
e questions Professor McGonagall 
"had set them, cobbled together something on the proper handling of "
bowtruckles for Professor Grubbly-Pl
"ank, and staggered up to bed, "
where he fell fully clothed on top of the bed covers and fell asleep 
immediately. 
Thursday passed in a haze of tire
"dness. Ron seemed very sleepy too, "
though Harry could not see why he 
should be. Harry’s third detention 
"passed in the same way as the previous two, except that after two "
hours the words “
I
must not tell lies
” did not fade from the back of 
"Harry’s hand, but remained scratched "
"there, oozing droplets of blood. "
The pause in the pointed quill’s sc
ratching made Professor Umbridge 
look up. 
"“Ah,” she said softly, moving arou"
nd her desk to examine his hand 
"herself. “Good. That ought to serve as a reminder to you, oughtn’t it? "
You may leave for tonight.” 
   271 “Do I still have to come back 
"tomorrow?” said Harry, picking up "
his schoolbag with his left hand 
rather than his smarting right. 
"“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge, "
"smiling widely as before. “Yes, "
I think we can etch the message a li
ttle deeper with another evening’s 
work.” 
He had never before considered th
e possibility that there might be 
another teacher in the world he ha
"ted more than Snape, but as he "
walked back toward Gryffindor To
wer he had to admit he had found 
a contender. 
"She’s evil,"
" he thought, as he climbed a staircase to the sev-"
"enth floor, "
"she’s an evil, twisted, mad, old "
— 
“Ron?” 
He had reached the top of the st
"airs, turned right, and almost "
"walked into Ron, who was lurking "
behind a statue of Lachlan the 
"Lanky, clutching his broomstick. He"
 gave a great leap of surprise 
when he saw Harry and attempted to hide his new Cleansweep Eleven 
behind his back. 
“What are you doing?” 
“Er — nothing. What are 
you
 doing?” 
Harry frowned at him. 
"“Come on, you can tell me! What are you hiding here for?” "
“I’m — I’m hiding from Fred and Ge
"orge, if you must know,” said "
"Ron. “They just went past with a bunch of first years, I bet they’re "
"testing stuff on them again, I me"
"an, they can’t do it in the common "
"room now, can they, not with Hermione there.” "
"He was talking in a very fast, feverish way. "
“But what have you got your br
"oom for, you haven’t been flying, "
have you?” Harry asked. 
"“I — well — well, okay, I’ll tell you,"
" but don’t laugh, all right?” Ron "
"said defensively, turning redder with "
every second. “I-I thought I’d try 
out for Gryffindor Keeper
 now I’ve got a decent 
broom. There. Go on. 
Laugh.” 
 272 "“I’m not laughing,” said Harry. Ron "
blinked. “It’s a brilliant idea! 
It’d be really cool if you got on the team! I’ve never seen you play 
"Keeper, are you good?” "
"“I’m not bad,” said Ron, who look"
ed immensely relieved at Harry’s 
"reaction. “Charlie, Fred, and George"
 always made me Keep for them 
when they were training during the holidays.” 
“So you’ve been practicing tonight?” 
"“Every evening since Tuesday . . . just on my own, though, I’ve "
been trying to bewitch Quaffles to 
"fly at me, but it hasn’t been easy "
and I don’t know how much use it’ll be.” Ron looked nervous and 
anxious. “Fred and George are going 
to laugh themselves stupid when 
I turn up for the tryouts. They ha
ven’t stopped taking the mickey out 
of me since I got made a prefect.” 
“I wish I was going to 
"be there,” said Harry bitte"
"rly, as they set off "
together toward the common room. 
"“Yeah, so do — Harry, what’s th"
at on the back 
of your hand?” 
"Harry, who had just scratched his "
"nose with his free right hand, "
"tried to hide it, but had as much "
success as Ron with his Cleansweep. 
“It’s just a cut — it’s
 nothing — it’s —” 
But Ron had grabbed Harry’s fore
arm and pulled the back of 
Harry’s hand up level with his eyes
". There was a pause, during which "
he stared at the words carved into
" the skin, then he released Harry, "
looking sick. 
“I thought you said she was giving you lines?” 
"Harry hesitated, but after all, Ro"
"n had been honest with him, so he "
told Ron the truth about the hour
s he had been spending in Um-
bridge’s office. 
“The old hag!” Ron said in a revolted
 whisper as they came to a halt 
"in front of the Fat Lady, who wa"
s dozing peacefully with her head 
against her frame. “She
’s sick! Go to McGona
"gall, say something!” "
"“No,” said Harry at once. “I’m not "
giving her the satisfaction of 
knowing she’s got to me.” 
   273 “
Got to you
? You can’t let her ge
t away with this!” 
“I don’t know how much power Mc
"Gonagall’s got over her,” said "
Harry. 
"“Dumbledore, then, tell Dumbledore!” "
"“No,” said Harry flatly. "
“Why not?” 
"“He’s got enough on his mind,” said Harry, but that was not the "
true reason. He was not going to go to Dumbledore for help when 
Dumbledore had not spoken to 
him once since last June. 
"“Well, I reckon you should —” Ron began, but he was interrupted "
"by the Fat Lady, who had been watc"
hing them sleepily and now burst 
"out, “Are you going to give me th"
e password or will I have to stay 
awake all night waitin
g for you to finish your conversation?” 
Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week. Though 
Harry glanced toward the staff tabl
e automatically when he entered 
"the Great Hall, it was without real hope of seeing Hagrid and he "
turned his mind immediately to his 
"more pressing problems, such as "
the mountainous pile of homework 
he had to do and the prospect of 
yet another detention with Umbridge. 
Two things sustained Ha
rry that day. One was the thought that it 
was almost the weekend; the other wa
"s that, dreadful though his final "
detention with Umbridge was sure to
" be, he had a distant view of the "
Quidditch pitch from her window an
"d might, with luck, be able to "
see something of Ron’s tryout. These we
"re rather feeble rays of light, it "
"was true, but Harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his "
present darkness; he had never had a worse first week of term at 
Hogwarts. 
At five o’clock that evening he 
knocked on Professor Umbridge’s 
office door for what he sincerely 
"hoped would be the final time, was "
told to enter and did so. The blan
k parchment lay ready for him on 
"the lace-covered table, the po"
inted black quill beside it. 
 274 "“You know what to do, Mr. Po"
"tter,” said Umbridge, smiling "
sweetly over at him. 
Harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window. If he 
just shifted his chair an inch or so 
to the right . . . On the pretext of 
shifting himself closer to the table he managed it. He now had a dis-
tant view of the Gryffindor Qui
dditch team soarin
g up and down the 
"pitch, while half a dozen black figu"
res stood at the f
oot of the three 
"high goalposts, apparently awaiting their turn to Keep. It was impos-"
sible to tell which one wa
s Ron at this distance. 
"I must not tell lies,"
 Harry wrote. The cut in the back of his right 
hand opened and began to bleed afresh. 
I must not tell lies.
" The cut dug deeper, st"
inging and smarting. 
I must not tell lies.
 Blood trickled down his wrist. 
He chanced another glance out 
of the window. Whoever was de-
fending the goalposts now was doin
g a very poor job indeed. Katie 
Bell scored twice in the few second
s Harry dared watch. Hoping very 
"much that the Keeper wasn’t Ron, "
he dropped his eyes back to the 
parchment dotted with blood. 
I must not tell lies.
I must not tell lies.
He looked up whenever he thought 
"he could risk it, when he could "
hear the scratching of Umbridge’s 
quill or the opening of a desk 
"drawer. The third person to try out was pretty good, the fourth was "
"terrible, the fifth dodged a Bludge"
r exceptionally we
ll but then fum-
bled an easy save. The sky was da
rkening so that Harry doubted he 
would be able to watch the sixt
h and seventh people at all. 
I must not tell lies.
I must not tell lies.
The parchment was now shining with
 drops of blood from the back 
"of his hand, which was searing with"
" pain. When he next looked up, "
night had fallen and the Quidditc
h pitch was no longer visible. 
   275 “Let’s see if you’ve gotten the me
"ssage yet, shall we?” said Um-"
bridge’s soft voice half an hour later. 
"She moved toward him, stretching "
out her short be-ringed fingers 
"for his arm. And then, as she took "
hold of him to examine the words 
"now cut into his skin, pain seared, "
"not across the back of his hand, but "
across the scar on his forehead. At 
"the same time, he had a most pe-"
culiar sensation somewher
e around his midriff. 
"He wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet, staring at "
"her. She looked back at him, a smil"
"e stretching her wide, slack mouth. "
"“Yes, it hurts, "
doesn’t it?” she said softly. 
He did not answer. His heart was thumping very hard and fast. Was 
she talking about his hand or did she 
know what he had just felt in his 
forehead? 
"“Well, I think I’ve made my point, Mr. Potter. You may go.” "
He caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he 
could. 
"Stay calm, "
he told himself as he sprinted up the stairs. 
"Stay calm, it "
doesn’t necessarily mean 
what you think it means.
 . . . 
“
Mimbulus mimbletonia
!” he gasped at th
"e Fat Lady, who swung "
forward once more. 
"A roar of sound greeted him. Ron came running toward him, "
beaming all over his face and sloppi
ng butterbeer down his front from 
the goblet he was clutching. 
"“Harry, I did it, I’m in, I’m Keeper!” "
“What? Oh — brilliant!
"” said Harry, trying to smile naturally, "
while his heart continued to race
 and his hand throbbed and bled. 
“Have a butterbeer.” Ron pressed a bottle onto him. “I can’t believe 
it — where’s Hermione gone?” 
"“She’s there,” said Fred, who wa"
"s also swigging butterbeer, and "
pointed to an armchair by the fi
"re. Hermione was dozing in it, her "
drink tipping precario
usly in her hand. 
 276 "“Well, she said she was pleased when I told her,” said Ron, looking "
slightly put out. 
"“Let her sleep,” said George hast"
ily. It was a few moments before 
Harry noticed that several of the firs
t years gathered ar
ound them bore 
unmistakable signs of recent nosebleeds. 
"“Come here, Ron, and see if Oliver"
"’s old robes fit you,” called Katie "
Bell. “We can take off his name an
d put yours on instead. . . .” 
"As Ron moved away, Angelina "
came striding up to Harry. 
“Sorry I was a bit short with you ea
"rlier, Potter,” she said abruptly. "
"“It’s stressful, this managing lark"
", you know, I’m starting to think I "
was a bit hard on Wood sometime
s.” She was watching Ron over the 
rim of her goblet with a 
slight frown on her face. 
"“Look, I know he’s your best mate, but he’s not fabulous,” she said "
bluntly. “I think with a bit of trai
"ning he’ll be all right, though. He "
comes from a family of good Quidditch players. I’m banking on him 
turning out to have a bit more ta
"lent than he showed today, to "
be honest. Vicky Frobisher and Geo
ffrey Hooper both flew better 
"this evening, but Hooper’s a real whiner, he’s always moaning about "
"something or other, and Vicky’s involv"
"ed in all sorts of societies, she "
admitted herself that if training 
clashed with her Charm Club she’d 
"put Charms first. Anyway, we’re having a practice session at two "
"o’clock tomorrow, so just make sure you’re there this time. And do me "
"a favor and help Ron as much as you can, okay?” "
He nodded and Angelina strolled 
back to Alicia Spinnet. Harry 
"moved over to sit next to Hermione, "
who awoke with a 
jerk as he put 
down his bag. 
"“Oh, Harry, it’s you. . . . Good"
" about Ron, isn’t it?” she said "
blearily. “I’m just so — so — so 
"tired,” she yawned. “I was up until "
one o’clock making more hats. They’re disappearing like mad!” 
"And sure enough, now that he looked, Harry saw that there were "
woolly hats concealed all around 
the room where unwary elves might 
accidentally pick them up. 
   277 "“Great,” said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon, "
"he would burst. “Listen, Hermione, I "
was just up in Umbridge’s office 
and she touched my arm . . .” 
Hermione listened closely. Wh
en Harry had finished she said 
"slowly, “You’re worried that You-Kn"
ow-Who’s controlling her like he 
controlled Quirrell?” 
"“Well,” said Harry, dropping his voice, “it’s a possibility, isn’t it?” "
"“I suppose so,” said Hermione, "
though she sounded unconvinced. 
“But I don’t think he can be 
possessing
 her the way he possessed Quir-
"rell, I mean, he’s properly alive again now, isn’t he, he’s got his own "
"body, he wouldn’t need to share some"
one else’s. He could have her un-
der the Imperius Curs
"e, I suppose. . . .” "
"Harry watched Fred, George, and L"
ee Jordan juggling empty but-
terbeer bottles for a moment. Then 
"Hermione said, “But last year "
"your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn’t Dumble-"
dore say it had to do with what 
You-Know-Who was feeling at the 
"time? I mean, maybe this hasn’t got anything to do with Umbridge at "
"all, maybe it’s just coincidence it "
happened while you were with her?” 
"“She’s evil,” said Harry flatly. “Twisted.” "
"“She’s horrible, yes, but . . . Ha"
"rry, I think you ou"
ght to tell Dum-
bledore your scar hurt.” 
It was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to 
Dumbledore and his answer to Hermio
ne was just the same as his an-
swer to Ron. 
“I’m not bothering him with this. Li
ke you just said
", it’s not a big "
deal. It’s been hurting on and off all summer — it was just a bit worse 
"tonight, that’s all —” "
"“Harry, I’m sure Dumbledore would "
want
 to be bothered by 
this —” 
"“Yeah,” said Harry, before he could "
"stop himself, “that’s the only bit "
of me Dumbledore cares ab
"out, isn’t it, my scar?” "
"“Don’t say that, it’s not true!” "
 278 "“I think I’ll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he thinks —” "
"“Harry, you can’t put something like that in a letter!” said "
"Hermione, looking alarmed. “Don’t "
"you remember, Moody told us to "
be careful what we put in writing! 
We just can’t guarantee owls aren’t 
being intercepted anymore!” 
"“All right, all right, I won’t tell "
"him, then!” said Harry irritably. He "
got to his feet. “I’m going to be
"d. Tell Ron for me, will you?” "
"“Oh no,” said Hermione, looking "
"relieved, “if you’re going that "
means I can go without being rude 
"too, I’m absolutely exhausted and "
I want to make some more hats to
"morrow. Listen, you can help me if "
"you like, it’s quite fun, I’m getting better, I can do patterns and bob-"
bles and all sorts of things now.” 
"Harry looked into her face, which "
"was shining with glee, and tried "
to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer. 
"“Er . . . no, I don’t think I will, "
"thanks,” he said. “Er — not tomor-"
row. I’ve got loads of homework to do. . . .” 
And he traipsed off to the boys’ st
"airs, leaving her looking slightly "
disappointed behind him. 
Harry was the first to awake in
 his dormitory next morning. 
He lay for a moment
 watching dust swirl in the chink of 
sunlight falling through the gap in 
his four-poster’s hangings and sa-
vored the thought that it was Saturday. The first week of term seemed 
to have dragged on fore
"ver, like one gigantic "
History of Magic lesson. 
Judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that 
"beam of sunlight, it was just af"
ter daybreak. He pulled open the cur-
"tains around his bed, got up, and "
started to dress. The only sound 
apart from the distant twittering of
" birds was the slow, deep breathing "
of his fellow Gryffindors. He opened
" his schoolbag carefully, pulled "
"out parchment and quill, and head"
ed out of the dormitory for the 
common room. 
Making straight for his favorite 
squashy old armcha
ir beside the 
"now extinct fire, Harry settled "
himself down comfortably and un-
rolled his parchment while looking ar
ound the room. The detritus of 
"crumpled-up bits of parchment, old Gobstones, empty ingredient jars, "
and candy wrappers that usually 
covered the commo
n room at the 
"end of each day was gone, as were"
 all Hermione’s elf hats. Wondering 
H 
 280 vaguely how many elves had now be
en set free whether they wanted 
"to be or not, Harry uncorked his in"
"k bottle, dipped his quill into it, "
and then held it suspended an in
ch above the smooth yellowish sur-
"face of his parchment, thinking hard. . . . But after a minute or so he "
found himself staring into the empty 
"grate, at a complete loss for what "
to say. 
He could now appreciate how 
hard it had been for Ron and 
Hermione to write him letters ov
er the summer. How was he sup-
posed to tell Sirius everything that
 had happened over the past week 
and pose all the questions he was 
burning to ask without giving po-
tential letter-thieves a lot of info
rmation he did not want them to 
have? 
"He sat quite motionless for a while,"
" gazing into the fireplace, then, "
"finally coming to a decision, he di"
pped his quill into the ink bottle 
once more and set it resolutely upon the parchment. 
"Dear Snuffles,"
"Hope you’re okay, the first week "
"back here’s been terrible, I’m "
really glad it’s the weekend.
"We’ve got a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Pro-"
fessor Umbridge. She’s nearly as nice as your mum. I’m writing 
because that thing I wrote to you about last summer happened 
again last night when I was do
ing a detention with Umbridge.
"We’re all missing our biggest friend, we hope he’ll be back soon."
Please write back quickly.
"Best,"
"Harry reread this letter several times,"
 trying to see it from the point 
of view of an outsider. He could not see how they would know what 
he was talking about — or who he wa
s talking to — just from reading 
   281 this letter. He did hope Sirius wo
uld pick up the hint about Hagrid 
and tell them when he might be ba
ck: Harry did not want to ask di-
rectly in case it drew too much at
tention to what Hagrid might be up 
to while he was not at Hogwarts. 
Considering it was a very short letter it had taken a long time to 
write; sunlight had crept halfway 
across the room wh
ile he had been 
"working on it, and he could now he"
ar distant sounds of movement 
from the dormitories above. Seal
ing the parchment carefully he 
climbed through the portrait hole
 and headed off for the Owlery. 
“I would 
not
" go that way if I were you,” said Nearly Headless Nick, "
drifting disconcertingly through a wa
ll just ahead of him as he walked 
down the passage. “Peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next 
person to pass the bust of Para
celsus halfway down the corridor.” 
“Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the person’s head?” 
asked Harry. 
"“Funnily enough, it "
"does,"
” said Nearly Headle
ss Nick in a bored 
voice. “Subtlety has never
 been Peeves’s strong 
point. I’m off to try 
and find the Bloody Baron.
 . . . He might be able
 to put a stop to it. 
". . . See you, Harry. . . .” "
"“Yeah, ’bye,” said Harry and instead "
"of turning right, he turned left, "
taking a longer but safer route up to
 the Owlery. His spirits rose as he 
walked past window after window sh
owing brilliantly blue sky; he had 
"training later, he would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last — "
Something brushed his ankles. He
 looked down and saw the care-
"taker’s skeletal gray cat, Mrs. No"
"rris, slinking past him. She turned "
lamplike yellow eyes upon him for 
a moment before disappearing be-
hind a statue of Wi
lfred the Wistful. 
"“I’m not doing anything wrong,” "
Harry called after her. She had 
the unmistakable air of a cat that 
"was off to report to her boss, yet "
Harry could not see why; he was per
fectly entitled to walk up to the 
Owlery on a Saturday morning. 
The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the 
 282 Owlery the glassless windows dazzled 
his eyes; thick silvery beams of 
sunlight crisscrossed the circular ro
om in which hundreds of owls nes-
"tled on rafters, a little restless in the early morning light, some clearly "
just returned from hunting. The st
raw-covered floor crunched a little 
"as he stepped across tiny animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of "
Hedwig. 
"“There you are,” he said, spotting her somewhere near the very top "
of the vaulted ceiling.
" “Get down here, I’ve "
got a letter for you.” 
With a low hoot she stretched he
r great white wings and soared 
down onto his shoulder. 
"“Right, I know this says ‘Snuffles’ on the outside,” he told her, giv-"
ing her the letter to clasp in her 
"beak and, withou"
t knowing exactly 
"why, whispering, “but it’s for Sirius, okay?” "
She blinked her amber eyes once and 
he took that to
 mean that she 
understood. 
"“Safe flight, then,” said Harry and he"
 carried her to one of the win-
dows; with a moment’s pressure on 
his arm Hedwig took off into the 
blindingly bright sky. He watched 
her until she became a tiny black 
"speck and vanished, then switched his "
"gaze to Hagrid’s hut, clearly vis-"
"ible from this window, and just as clearly uninhabited, the chimney "
"smokeless, the curtains drawn. "
The treetops of the Forbidden Fo
rest swayed in a light breeze. 
"Harry watched them, savoring the fres"
"h air on his face, thinking about "
Quidditch later . . . and then he 
"saw it. A great, reptilian winged "
"horse, just like the ones pulling "
"the Hogwarts carriages, with leathery "
black wings spread wide like a pter
"odactyl’s, rose up "
out of the trees 
"like a grotesque, giant bird. It soar"
ed in a great circle and then plunged 
once more into the trees. The wh
ole thing had happened so quickly 
Harry could hardly believe what he ha
"d seen, except that his heart was "
hammering madly. 
The Owlery door opened behind him. 
"He leapt in shock, and turn-"
"ing quickly, saw Cho Chang holding a letter and a parcel in her hands. "
   283 "“Hi,” said Harry automatically. "
"“Oh . . . hi,” she said breathlessly. "
“I didn’t think anyone would be 
up here this early. . . . I only re
"membered five minutes ago, it’s my "
mum’s birthday.” 
She held up the parcel. 
"“Right,” said Harry. His brain seem"
ed to have jammed. He wanted 
"to say something funny and interesting, but the memory of that terri-"
ble winged horse was fresh in his mind. 
"“Nice day,” he said, gesturing to "
the windows. His insides seemed 
to shrivel with embarrassment. The weather. He was talking about the 
weather.
 . . . 
"“Yeah,” said Cho, looking around"
 for a suitable owl. “Good Quid-
ditch conditions. I haven’t b
"een out all week, have you?” "
"“No,” said Harry. "
Cho had selected one of the school
 barn owls. She coaxed it down 
onto her arm where it held
 out an obliging leg so that she could attach 
the parcel. 
"“Hey, has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet?” she asked. "
"“Yeah,” said Harry. “It’s my friend"
" Ron Weasley, d’you know him?” "
“The Tornado-hater?” said Cho ra
ther coolly. “Is he any good?” 
"“Yeah,” said Harry, “I think so. I di"
"dn’t see his tryout, though, I was "
in detention.” 
"Cho looked up, the parcel only half-attached to the owl’s legs. "
"“That Umbridge woman’s foul,” she "
said in a low voice. “Putting 
you in detention just because you told the truth about how — how 
— how he died. Everyone heard about 
"it, it was all over the school. "
You were really brave standing up to her like that.” 
Harry’s insides reinflated so rapidl
y he felt as though he might ac-
tually float a few inches off the dropping-strewn floor. Who cared 
"about a stupid flying horse, Cho thou"
ght he had been re
ally brave. . . . 
For a moment he considered accid
entally-on-purpose showing her his 
cut hand as he helped her tie her pa
rcel onto her owl. . . . But the very 
 284 instant that this thri
"lling thought occurred,"
 the Owlery door opened 
again. 
"Filch, the caretaker, came wheezi"
ng into the room. There were pur-
"ple patches on his sunken, veined "
"cheeks, his jowls were aquiver and "
his thin gray hair disheveled; he 
had obviously run here. Mrs. Norris 
"came trotting at his heels, gazing "
up at the owls overhead and mewing 
hungrily. There was a restless shifting
" of wings from above, and a large "
brown owl snapped his beak in a menacing fashion. 
"“Aha!” said Filch, taking a fl"
"at-footed step toward Harry, his "
pouchy cheeks trembling with anger. “I’ve had a tip-off that you are 
intending to place a massive order for Dungbombs!” 
Harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker. 
“Who told you I was 
ordering Dungbombs?” 
Cho was looking from Harry to Filc
"h, also frowning; the barn owl "
"on her arm, tired of standing on o"
"ne leg, gave an admonitory hoot but "
she ignored it. 
"“I have my sources,” said Filch in"
 a self-satisfied hiss. “Now hand 
over whatever it is you’re sending.” 
Feeling immensely thankful that he
 had not dawdled in posting off 
"the letter, Harry said, “I"
" can’t, it’s gone.” "
“
Gone
"?” said Filch, his face"
 contorting with rage. 
"“Gone,” said Harry calmly. "
"Filch opened his mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then "
raked Harry’s robes with his eyes. 
“How do I know you haven’t got it 
in your pocket?” 
“Because —” 
"“I saw him send it,”"
 said Cho angrily. 
Filch rounded on her. 
“You saw him — ?” 
"“That’s right, I saw hi"
"m,” she said fiercely. "
There was a moment’s pause in which Filch glared at Cho and Cho  
   285 "glared right back, then th"
e caretaker turned and 
shuffled back toward 
the door. He stopped with his hand on
 the handle and looked back at 
Harry. 
“If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb . . .” 
He stumped off down the stairs. Mr
s. Norris cast a last longing 
look at the owls and followed him. 
Harry and Cho looked at each other. 
"“Thanks,” Harry said. "
"“No problem,” said Cho, finally fixi"
ng the parcel to the barn owl’s 
"other leg, her face "
slightly pink. “You 
weren’t
" ordering Dungbombs, "
were you?” 
"“No,” said Harry. "
"“I wonder why he thought you were, then?” she said, as she carried "
the owl to the window. 
Harry shrugged; he was quite as my
"stified by that as she was, "
"though, oddly, it was not botherin"
g him very much at the moment. 
They left the Owlery together. At the entrance of a corridor that led 
"toward the west wing of the castle, Cho said, “I’m going this way. "
"Well, I’ll . . . I’ll "
"see you around, Harry.” "
“Yeah . . . see you.” 
"She smiled at him and departed. He walked on, feeling quietly "
elated. He had managed to have an
 entire conversation with her and 
not embarrassed himself once. . . . 
You were really brave standing up to 
her like that.
 . . .
She had called him brave. . 
. . She did not hate him 
for being alive. . . . 
"Of course, she had preferred Cedric"
", he knew that. . . . Though if "
he’d only asked her to the ball befo
"re Cedric had, things might have "
turned out differently. . . . She ha
d seemed sincerely sorry that she 
had to refuse when Har
ry had asked her. . . . 
"“Morning,” Harry said brightly "
"to Ron and Hermione, joining "
them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall. 
 286 “What are you looking so pleased 
"about?” said Ron, eyeing Harry "
in surprise. 
"“Erm . . . Quidditch later,” said "
"Harry happily, pulling a large plat-"
ter of bacon and eg
gs toward him. 
“Oh . . . yeah . . .” said Ron. He put down the bit of toast he was 
eating and took a large swig of pu
mpkin juice. Then 
"he said, “Listen "
. . . you don’t fancy going out a bit 
"earlier with me, do you? Just to — "
er — give me some practice before
" training? So I can, you know, get "
my eye in a bit . . .” 
"“Yeah, okay,” said Harry. "
"“Look, I don’t think you should,” "
"said Hermione seriously, “you’re "
both really behind on 
homework as it —” 
But she broke off; the morning post 
"was arriving and, as usual, the "
Daily Prophet
 was soaring toward her in 
"the beak of a screech owl, "
which landed perilously close to th
e sugar bowl and held out a leg; 
Hermione pushed a Knut into its 
"leather pouch, took the newspaper, "
and scanned the front page critical
ly as the owl took off again. 
“Anything interesting?” said Ron;
 Harry smiled — he knew Ron 
was keen to get her off 
the subject of homework. 
"“No,” she sighed, “just some guff"
 about the bass player in the 
Weird Sisters getting married. . . .” 
She opened the paper and disappea
red behind it. Harry devoted 
himself to another helping of eggs 
and bacon; Ron was staring up at 
"the high windows, lookin"
g slightly preoccupied. 
"“Wait a moment,” said Hermione suddenly. “Oh no . . . Sirius!” "
"“What’s happened?” said Harry, and "
he snatched at the paper so 
violently that it ripped down the 
middle so that he and Hermione 
were holding half each. 
“‘
The Ministry of Magic has received a tip-off from a reliable source 
"that Sirius Black, notorious mass murderer"
 . . . 
blah blah blah
 . . . 
is cur-
rently hiding in London
!’” Hermione read from her half in an anguished 
whisper. 
   287 "“Lucius Malfoy, I’ll bet anything,” said Harry in a low, furious "
voice. “He 
did
 recognize Sirius on 
the platform. . . .” 
"“What?” said Ron, looking alarmed. “You didn’t say —” "
“Shh!” said the other two. 
“. . . ‘
Ministry warns Wizarding community
 that Black is very danger-
ous
 . . . 
killed thirteen people
 . . . 
broke out of Azkaban
 . . .’ the usual 
"rubbish,” Hermione concluded, laying"
 down her half of the paper and 
looking fearfully at Harry and Ron. “W
"ell, he just won’t be able to "
"leave the house again, that’s all,” she whispered. “Dumbledore did "
warn him not to.” 
Harry looked down glumly at the bit of the 
Prophet
 he had torn off. 
Most of the page was devoted to
 an advertisement for Madame 
"Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions, w"
hich was apparently having a sale. 
"“Hey!” he said, flattening it"
 down so Hermione and Ron could 
both see it. “Look at this!” 
“I’ve got all the robes 
"I want,” said Ron. "
"“No,” said Harry, “look . . . th"
is little piec
e here . . .” 
Ron and Hermione bent closer to re
ad it; the item was barely an 
inch long and placed right at th
e bottom of a column. It was head-
lined: 
TRESPASS AT MINISTRY 
"Sturgis Podmore, 38, of number two, Laburnum "
"Gardens, Clapham, has appe"
ared in front of the 
Wizengamot charged with trespass and attempted 
robbery at the Ministry of Magic on 31st August. 
Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watch-
"wizard Eric Munch, who found him attempting to "
force his way through a top-security door at one 
"o’clock in the morning. Podmore, who refused to "
"speak in his own defense,"
 was convicted on both 
charges and sentenced to 
six months in Azkaban. 
 288 “Sturgis Podmore?” said Ron slowly
", “but he’s that"
 bloke who looks 
"like his head’s been thatched, is"
n’t he? He’s one 
of the Ord —” 
"“Ron, "
shh
"!” said Hermione, casting a terrified look around them. "
“Six months in Azkaban!” whispe
"red Harry, shocked. “Just for try-"
ing to get through a door!” 
"“Don’t be silly, it wasn’t just "
for trying to ge
t through a door — 
what on earth was he doing at the 
Ministry of Magic at one o’clock in 
the morning?” breathed Hermione. 
“D’you reckon he was doing 
something for the Order?” Ron 
muttered. 
“Wait a moment. . . .” said Harry slowly. “Sturgis was supposed to 
"come and see us off, remember?” "
The other two looked at him. 
"“Yeah, he was supposed to be part"
 of our guard going to King’s 
"Cross, remember? And Moody was all "
annoyed because he didn’t turn 
"up, so that doesn’t seem like he wa"
"s supposed to be on a job for them, "
does it?” 
"“Well, maybe they didn’t expe"
"ct him to get caught,” said "
Hermione. 
“It could be a frame-up!” Ron excl
aimed excitedly. “No — listen!” 
"he went on, dropping his voice dram"
atically at the threatening look 
on Hermione’s face. “The Ministry su
spects he’s one of Dumbledore’s 
lot so — I dunno — they 
lured
" him to the Ministry, and he wasn’t "
trying to get through a door at al
l! Maybe they’ve just made some-
thing up to get him!” 
There was a pause while Harry and Hermione considered this. 
Harry thought it seemed far-fetched
"; Hermione, on the other hand, "
looked rather impressed 
"and said, “Do you know, "
I wouldn’t be at all 
surprised if that were true.” 
She folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully. When Harry 
laid down his knife and 
fork she seemed to co
me out of a reverie. 
   289 "“Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on Self-"
"Fertilizing Shrubs first, "
and if we’re lucky we’ll 
be able to start McGo-
nagall’s Inanimatus Conjur
us before lunch. . . .” 
Harry felt a small twinge of guilt 
at the thought of the pile of 
homework awaiting him up
"stairs, but the sky was "
"a clear, exhilarating "
"blue, and he had not been on "
his Firebolt for a week. . . . 
"“I mean, we can do it tonight,” sa"
"id Ron, as he and Harry walked "
down the sloping lawns toward th
"e Quidditch pitch, their broom-"
"sticks over their shoulders, Hermio"
ne’s dire warnings that they would 
fail all their O.W.L.s still ringing 
in their ears. “And we’ve got tomor-
row. She gets too worked up about wo
"rk, that’s her trouble. . . .” There "
"was a pause and he added, in a slightly more anxious tone, “D’you "
think she meant it when she said
 we weren’t copying from her?” 
"“Yeah, I do,” said Harry. “Still, th"
"is is important too, we’ve got to "
practice if we want to stay 
on the Quidditch team. . . .” 
"“Yeah, that’s right,” said Ron "
in a heartened tone. “And we 
have
 got 
plenty of time to do it all. . . .” 
Harry glanced over to his right as
 they approached the Quidditch 
"pitch, to where the trees of the Fo"
rbidden Forest were swaying darkly. 
Nothing flew out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant 
owls fluttering around the Owlery
 Tower. He had enough to worry 
about; the flying horse wasn’t doing
 him any harm: He pushed it out 
of his mind. 
They collected balls from the cupb
oard in the changing room and 
"set to work, Ron guarding the three tall goalposts, Harry playing "
Chaser and trying to get the Quaf
fle past Ron. Harry thought Ron 
was pretty good; he blocked three-quarters of the goals Harry at-
tempted to put past him and played 
better the longer they practiced. 
"After a couple of hours they returned to the school, where they ate "
"lunch, during which Hermione made"
 it quite clear that she thought 
"they were irresponsible, then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the  "
 290 real training session. All their team
mates but Angelina were already in 
the changing room when they entered. 
"“All right, Ron?” said George, winking at him. "
"“Yeah,” said Ron, who had become quieter and quieter all the way "
down to the pitch. 
"“Ready to show us all up, Ickle"
" Prefect?” said Fred, emerging "
tousle-haired from the neck of his 
"Quidditch robes, a slightly mali-"
cious grin on his face. 
"“Shut up,” said Ron, stony-faced,"
 pulling on his own team robes 
for the first time. They fitted 
him well considering they had been 
"Oliver Wood’s, who was rather broader in the shoulder. "
"“Okay everyone,” said Angelina, ente"
"ring from the Captain’s office, "
already changed. “Let’s get to it; Al
"icia and Fred, if you can just bring "
"the ball crate out for us. Oh, and there are a couple of people out there "
watching but I want you to ju
"st ignore them, all right?” "
Something in her would-be casu
al voice made Harry think he 
"might know who the uninvited spectators were, and sure enough, "
when they left the changing room fo
r the bright sunlight of the pitch 
it was to a storm of catcalls and 
jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch 
"team and assorted hangers-on, wh"
o were grouped halfway up the 
empty stands and whose voices echo
ed loudly around
 the stadium. 
“What’s that Weasley’s riding?” Malfoy called in his sneering drawl. 
“Why would anyone put a Flying Charm on a moldy old log like 
that?” 
"Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with "
laughter. Ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground 
"and Harry followed him, watching his"
 ears turn red from behind. 
"“Ignore them,” he said, accelerati"
ng to catch up with Ron. “We’ll 
see who’s laughing after 
we play them. . . .” 
"“Exactly the attitude I want, Harry,” said Angelina approvingly, "
soaring around them with the Qua
ffle under her arm and slowing to 
hover on the spot in front of her 
"airborne team. “Okay everyone, we’re "
   291 "going to start with some passes just to warm up, the whole team "
please —” 
"“Hey, Johnson, what’s with that "
hairstyle anyway?” shrieked Pansy 
Parkinson from below. “Why would an
yone want to lo
ok like they’ve 
got worms coming out of their head?” 
Angelina swept her long braided 
hair out of her face and said 
"calmly, “Spread out, th"
"en, and let’s see what"
 we can do. . . .” 
Harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch. 
Ron fell back toward th
e opposite goal. Angeli
na raised the Quaffle 
with one hand and threw it hard 
"to Fred, who passed to George, who "
"passed to Harry, who passed"
" to Ron, who dropped it. "
"The Slytherins, led by Malfoy, roared and screamed with laughter. "
"Ron, who had pelted toward"
 the ground to catch the Quaffle before it 
"landed, pulled out of the dive untidily"
", so that he slipped sideways on "
"his broom, and returned "
"to playing height, blushing. Harry saw Fred "
"and George exchange looks, but uncharacteristically neither of them "
"said anything, for which he was grateful. "
"“Pass it on, Ron,” called Angelina"
", as though nothing had happened. "
Ron threw the Quaffle to Alicia
", who passed back to Harry, who "
passed to George. . . . 
"“Hey, Potter, how’s your scar feeling?” called Malfoy. “Sure you "
"don’t need a lie-down? It must be, "
"what, a whole week since you were "
"in the hospital wing, that’s "
"a record for you, isn’t it?” "
Fred passed to Angelina; she reve
"rse passed to Harry, who had not "
"been expecting it, but caught it in"
 the very tips of his fingers and 
"passed it quickly to Ron, who lung"
ed for it and missed by inches. 
"“Come on now, Ron,” said Angelina crossly, as Ron dived for the "
"ground again, chasing the Quaffle. “Pay attention.” "
It would have been hard to say wh
ether Ron’s face or the Quaffle 
was a deeper scarlet when he returned again to playing height. Malfoy 
and the rest of the Slytherin team were howling with laughter. 
"On his third attempt, Ron caught "
the Quaffle; perhaps out of relief 
 292 he passed it on so enthusiastically 
that it soared straight through 
Katie’s outstretched hands an
d hit her hard in the face. 
"“Sorry!” Ron groaned, zooming fo"
rward to see whether he had 
done any damage. 
"“Get back in position, she’s fine!” "
barked Angelina. “But as you’re 
"passing to a teammate, do "
try
 not to knock her 
"off her broom, won’t "
you? We’ve got Bludgers for that!” 
Katie’s nose was bleeding. Down 
below the Slytherins were stamp-
ing their feet and jeering. Fred 
and George converged on Katie. 
"“Here, take this,” Fred told he"
"r, handing her something small and "
purple from out of his pocket. “It’ll clear it up in no time.” 
"“All right,” called Angelina, “Fred, George, go and get your bats "
"and a Bludger; Ron, get up to the "
"goalposts, Harry, release the Snitch "
when I say so. We’re going to 
"aim for Ron’s goal, obviously.” "
Harry zoomed off after the 
twins to fetch the Snitch. 
"“Ron’s making a right pig’s ear of things, isn’t he?” muttered "
"George, as the three of them landed"
 at the crate containing the balls 
and opened it to extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch. 
"“He’s just nervous,” said Harry. “H"
e was fine when I was practicing 
with him this morning.” 
"“Yeah, well, I hope he hasn’t peak"
"ed too soon,” said"
 Fred gloomily. 
They returned to the air. When
" Angelina blew her whistle, Harry "
released the Snitch and Fred and George let fly the Bludger; from that 
"moment on, Harry was barely aware of"
 what the others were doing. It 
was his job to recapture the tiny fl
uttering golden ball that was worth 
a hundred and fifty points to the S
eeker’s team and doing so required 
"enormous speed and skill. He accelerated, rolling and swerving in and "
"out of the Chasers, the warm autu"
mn air whipping his face and the 
distant yells of the Slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ears. 
". . . But too soon, the whistle "
brought him to a halt again. 
“Stop — 
stop
 – STOP!” screamed Angelina. “Ron — you’re not 
covering your middle post!” 
   293 "Harry looked around at Ron, who wa"
s hovering in front of the left-
"hand hoop, leaving the other two completely unprotected. "
“Oh . . . sorry . . .” 
“You keep shifting around while yo
u’re watching the Chasers!” said 
Angelina. “Either stay in center posi
tion until you have to move to de-
"fend a hoop, or else circle the hoops,"
 but don’t drift vaguely off to one 
"side, that’s how you let in"
 the last three goals!” 
"“Sorry . . .” Ron repeated, his red fa"
ce shining like a beacon against 
the bright blue sky. 
"“And Katie, can’t you do some"
thing about that nosebleed?” 
“It’s just getting worse!” said Kati
"e thickly, attempting to stem the "
flow with her sleeve. 
"Harry glanced around at Fred, who was looking anxious and check-"
ing his pockets. He saw Fred pull
" out something purple, examine it "
"for a second, and then look around "
"at Katie, evidently horrorstruck. "
"“Well, let’s try again,” said Ange"
lina. She was ignoring the Slyth-
"erins, who had now set up a chant of “"
"Gryffindor are losers, Gryffindor "
"are losers,"
” but there was a certain rigidity
 about her seat on the broom 
nevertheless. 
This time they had been flying
 for barely three minutes when 
"Angelina’s whistle sounded. Harry,"
 who had just sighted the Snitch 
"circling the opposite goalpost, pulled"
 up feeling distinctly aggrieved. 
“What now?” he said impatientl
"y to Alicia, who was nearest. "
"“Katie,” she said shortly. "
"Harry turned and saw Angelina, Fred, "
and George all flying as fast 
as they could toward Katie. Harry an
d Alicia sped toward her too. It 
was plain that Angelina 
had stopped training ju
st in time; Katie was 
now chalk-white and covered in blood. 
“She needs the hospital 
"wing,” said Angelina. "
"“We’ll take her,” said Fred. “She"
 — er — might have swallowed a 
Blood Blisterpod by mistake —” 
"“Well, there’s no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser "
 294 "gone,” said Angelina glumly, as Fr"
ed and George zoomed off toward 
"the castle supporting Katie between them. “Come on, let’s go and get "
changed.” 
The Slytherins continued to chant as they trailed back into the 
changing rooms. 
“How was practice?” asked Hermio
ne rather coolly half an hour 
"later, as Harry and Ron climbed thro"
ugh the portrait 
hole into the 
Gryffindor common room. 
“It was —” Harry began. 
"“Completely lousy,” said Ron in a "
"hollow voice, sinking into a chair "
beside Hermione. She looked up at
 Ron and her frostiness seemed to 
melt. 
"“Well, it was only your first one,"
"” she said consolingly, “it’s bound "
to take time to —” 
“Who said it was me who made it lousy?” snapped Ron. 
"“No one,” said Hermione, looking taken aback, “I thought —” "
“You thought I was bo
und to be rubbish?” 
"“No, of course I didn’t! Look, you "
said it was lousy so I just —” 
"“I’m going to get started on some homework,” said Ron angrily "
and stomped off to the staircase to 
the boys’ dormitories and vanished 
from sight. Hermione
 turned to Harry. 
“
Was
 he lousy?” 
"“No,” said Harry loyally. "
Hermione raised her eyebrows. 
"“Well, I suppose he could’ve play"
"ed better,” Harry muttered, “but "
it was only the first training 
"session, like you said. . . .” "
Neither Harry nor Ron seemed to make much headway with their 
homework that night. Harry knew Ron was too preoccupied with 
how badly he had performed at Qu
idditch practice and he himself 
was having difficulty in getting the chant of “
Gryffindor are losers
” out 
of his head. 
They spent the whole of Sunday in
" the common room, buried in "
   295 their books while the room around th
"em filled up, then emptied: It "
"was another clear, fine day and most "
of their fellow Gryffindors spent 
"the day out in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the "
last sunshine that year. By the even
ing Harry felt as 
though somebody 
had been beating his brain agai
nst the inside of his skull. 
"“You know, we probably should "
try and get more homework done 
"during the week,” Harry muttered to"
" Ron, as they finally laid aside "
Professor McGonagall’s long essay 
on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell 
and turned miserably to Professor Si
nistra’s equally long and difficult 
essay about Jupiter’s moons. 
"“Yeah,” said Ron, rubbing slightly"
 bloodshot eyes and throwing his 
fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them. “Listen . . . 
shall we just ask Hermione if we ca
n have a look at 
what she’s done?” 
Harry glanced over at her; she was 
sitting with Crookshanks on her 
lap and chatting merrily to Ginny as 
a pair of knitting needles flashed 
"in midair in front of her, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks. "
"“No,” he said heavily, “you"
 know she won’t let us.” 
And so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became 
"steadily darker; slowly, "
the crowd in the common
 room began to thin 
"again. At half-past eleven, He"
"rmione wandered over to them, "
yawning. 
“Nearly done?” 
"“No,” said Ron shortly. "
“Jupiter’s biggest moon is Gany
"mede, not Callisto,” she said, "
"pointing over Ron’s shoulder at a line in his Astronomy essay, “and it’s "
Io that’s got the volcanos.” 
"“Thanks,” snarled Ron, scratching"
 out the offending sentences. 
"“Sorry, I only —” "
"“Yeah, well, if you’ve just come over here to criticize —” "
“Ron —” 
"“I haven’t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I’m "
up to my neck 
in it here —” 
 296 “No — look!” 
Hermione was pointing to th
e nearest window. Harry and Ron 
both looked over. A handsome scr
eech owl was standing on the win-
"dowsill, gazing into "
the room at Ron. 
"“Isn’t that Hermes?” said Hermione, sounding amazed. "
"“Blimey, it is!” said Ron quietly, throwing down his quill and get-"
ting to his feet. “What’s 
Percy writing to me for?” 
"He crossed to the window and opened it; Hermes flew inside, "
"landed upon Ron’s essay, and held "
out a leg to which a letter was at-
tached. Ron took it off and the ow
"l departed at once, leaving inky "
footprints across Ron’s 
drawing of the moon Io. 
“That’s definitely Percy’s handwritin
"g,” said Ron, sinking back into "
his chair and staring at the word
s on the outside of the scroll: 
To 
"Ronald Weasley, Gryffindor House, Hogwarts."
 He looked up at the other 
two. “What d’you reckon?” 
“Open it!” said Hermione
 eagerly. Harry nodded. 
Ron unrolled the scroll and bega
n to read. The farther down the 
"parchment his eyes traveled, the mo"
re pronounced became his scowl. 
"When he had finished reading, he l"
ooked disgusted. He thrust the let-
"ter at Harry and Hermione, who leaned"
 toward each other to read it 
together: 
"Dear Ron,"
I have only just heard (from no less a person than the Minister 
"of Magic himself, who has it fr"
"om your new teacher, Professor "
Umbridge) that you have be
come a Hogwarts prefect.
I was most pleasantly surprise
d when I heard this news and 
must firstly offer my congratulations. I must admit that I have al-
ways been afraid that you would take what we might call the 
"“Fred and George” route, rather than"
" following in my footsteps, so "
you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting 
authority and have decided to shou
lder some real responsibility.
   297 But I want to give you more 
"than congratulations, Ron, I "
"want to give you some advice, which is why I am sending this at "
night rather than by the usual morning post. Hopefully you will 
be able to read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward 
questions.
From something the Minister let slip when telling me you are 
"now a prefect, I gather that you ar"
e still seeing a lot of Harry Pot-
"ter. I must tell you, Ron, that no"
thing could put you in danger of 
losing your badge more than continued fraternization with that 
"boy. Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear this "
— 
no doubt you 
will say that Potter has always been Dumbledore’s favorite 
— 
but 
I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at 
Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very dif-
ferent 
— 
and probably more accurate 
— 
view of Potters behav-
"ior. I shall say no more here, but if you look at the"
 Daily Prophet 
tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blow-
ing 
— 
and see if you can spot yours truly!
"Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same "
"brush as Potter, it could be very damaging to your future "
"prospects, and I am talking here about life after school too. As you "
"must be aware, given that our father escorted him to court, Pot-"
ter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole 
Wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good. He 
got off on a mere technicality if
 you ask me and many of the peo-
ple I’ve spoken to remain
 convinced of his guilt.
It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter 
— 
I 
"know that he can be unbalanced and, for all I know, violent "
— 
"but if you have any worries about this, or have spotted anything "
"else in Potter’s behavior that is troubling you, I urge you to speak "
"to Dolores Umbridge, a really "
"delightful woman, who I know "
will be only too happy to advise you.
This leads me to my other bit of advice. As I have hinted
 298 "above, Dumbledore’s regime at Hogwarts may soon be over. Your "
"loyalty, Ron, should be not to hi"
"m, but to the school and the Min-"
istry. I am very sorry to hear that so far Professor Umbridge is en-
countering very little cooperation fr
om staff as she strives to make 
those necessary changes within Hogw
arts that the Ministry so ar-
dently desires (although she should
 find this easier from next 
week 
— 
"again, see the"
 Prophet 
tomorrow!). I shall say only this 
— 
a student who shows himself willing to help Professor Um-
bridge now may be very well placed for Head Boyship in a couple 
of years!
I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the sum-
"mer. It pains me to criticize our parents, but I am afraid I can no "
longer live under their roof whil
e they remain mixed up with the 
dangerous crowd around Dumbledore (if you are writing to 
"Mother at any point, you might "
tell her that a certain Sturgis 
"Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledore’s, has recently been "
sent to Azkaban for trespass at 
the Ministry. Perhaps that will 
open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom they are 
currently rubbing shoulders). I coun
t myself very lucky to have es-
caped the stigma of association with such people 
— 
the Minister 
really could not be 
more gracious to me 
— 
"and I do hope, Ron, "
that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided 
nature of our parents’ beliefs and actions either. I sincerely hope 
"that, in time, they will realize how mistaken they were and I "
"shall, of course, be ready to acce"
pt a full apology when that day 
comes.
"Please think over what I have said most carefully, particularly "
"the bit about Harry Potter, and "
congratulations again on becom-
ing prefect.
"Your brother, "
   299 Harry looked up at Ron. 
"“Well,” he said, trying to soun"
d as though he found the whole 
"thing a joke, “if you want to — er "
— what is it?” (He checked Percy’s 
letter.) “Oh yeah — ‘sever
" ties’ with me, I swea"
r I won’t get violent.” 
"“Give it back,” said Ron, holding "
out his hand. “He is —” Ron said 
"jerkily, tearing Percy’s letter in half, “the world’s” — he tore it into "
quarters — “biggest” — he 
tore it into eighths — “
git.
” He threw the 
pieces into the fire. 
"“Come on, we’ve got to get this finished some time before dawn,” "
"he said briskly to Harry, pulling Pr"
ofessor Sinistra’s 
essay back toward 
him. 
Hermione was looking at Ron with
 an odd expression on her face. 
"“Oh, give them here,” she said abruptly. "
“What?” said Ron. 
"“Give them to me, I’ll look through them and correct them,” she "
said. 
"“Are you serious? Ah, Hermione, "
"you’re a lifesaver,” said Ron, "
“what can I — ?” 
"“What you can say is, ‘We promise "
we’ll never leave our homework 
"this late again,’” she said, holding "
"out both hands for their essays, but "
she looked slightly 
amused all the same. 
"“Thanks a million, Hermione,” said"
" Harry weakly, passing over his "
essay and sinking back into hi
"s armchair, rubbing his eyes. "
It was now past midnight and th
e common room was deserted but 
for the three of them and Crookshan
ks. The only sound was that of 
Hermione’s quill scratching out s
entences here and there on their 
essays and the ruffle of pages as sh
e checked various facts in the refer-
ence books strewn across th
e table. Harry was exha
usted. He also felt 
"an odd, sick, empty feeling in hi"
s stomach that had nothing to do 
with tiredness and everything to
 do with the letter now curling 
blackly in the he
art of the fire. 
He knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought him 
 300 "strange, even mad; "
he knew that the 
Daily Prophet
 had been making 
"snide allusions to him for months, "
but there was some
thing about see-
ing it written down like that in Pe
"rcy’s writing, about knowing that "
Percy was advising Ron to drop him and even to tell tales on him to 
"Umbridge, that made his situation real"
 to him as nothing else had. He 
"had known Percy for four years, had stayed in his house during the "
"summers, shared a tent with him "
"during the Quidditch World Cup, "
had even been awarded full marks by 
him in the second task of the 
"Triwizard Tournament last year, "
"yet now, Percy thought him unbal-"
anced and possibly violent. 
And with a surge of sympathy for 
"his godfather, Harry thought that "
Sirius was probably the only person
 he knew who could really under-
"stand how he felt at the moment, beca"
use Sirius was in the same situ-
ation; nearly everyone in the Wi
zarding world thought Sirius a 
dangerous murderer and a great Vo
ldemort supporter and he had had 
to live with that knowledg
e for fourteen years. . . . 
Harry blinked. He had just seen so
mething in the fire that could 
not have been there. It had flashe
d into sight and vanished immedi-
ately. No . . . it could not have been. . . . He had imagined it because 
he had been thinking
 about Sirius. . . . 
"“Okay, write that down,” Hermione "
"said to Ron, pushing his essay "
"and a sheet covered in her own writing back to Ron, “and then copy "
out this conclusion that
 I’ve written for you.” 
"“Hermione, you are honestly the mo"
st wonderful person I’ve ever 
"met,” said Ron weakly"
", “and if I’m ever ru"
de to you again —” 
“— I’ll know you’re back to 
"normal,” said Hermione. “Harry, "
yours is okay except for this bit at
" the end, I think you must have mis-"
"heard Professor Sinistra, Europa’s covered in "
"ice,"
 not mice — Harry?” 
Harry had slid off his chair onto
 his knees and was now crouching 
"on the singed and threadbare hearthrug, gazing into the flames. "
“Er — Harry?” said Ron uncertainly. “Why are you down there?” 
“Because I’ve just seen Sirius’s 
"head in the fire,” said Harry. "
   301 "He spoke quite calmly; after all, he"
 had seen Sirius’s head in this 
very fire the previous year and talked
" to it too. Nevertheless, he could "
not be sure that he had really seen it
 this time. . . . It had vanished so 
quickly. . . . 
“Sirius’s head?” Hermione repeat
ed. “You mean like when he 
wanted to talk to you during 
the Triwizard Tournament? But he 
"wouldn’t do that now,"
 it would be too — 
Sirius
!” 
"She gasped, gazing at the fire; Ron dropped his quill. There in the "
middle of the dancing flames sat Siri
"us’s head, long dark hair falling "
around his grinning face. 
“I was starting to think you’d go 
to bed before everyone else had 
"disappeared,” he said. “I’ve "
been checking every hour.” 
“You’ve been popping into the fire
" every hour?” Harry said, half "
laughing. 
“Just for a few seconds to chec
k if the coast was clear yet.” 
“But what if you’d been seen?” said Hermione anxiously. 
"“Well, I think a girl — first year "
by the look of her — might’ve got 
"a glimpse of me earlier, but don’t"
" worry,” Sirius said hastily, as "
Hermione clapped a hand to her mo
uth. “I was gone the moment she 
looked back at me and I’ll bet she 
just thought I was an oddly shaped 
log or something.” 
"“But Sirius, this is taking an awful risk —” Hermione began. "
"“You sound like Molly,” said Siri"
us. “This was the only way I could 
come up with of answering Harry’s letter without resorting to a 
code — and codes are breakable.” 
"At the mention of Harry’s letter, Hermione and Ron had both "
turned to stare at him. 
“You didn’t say you’d written to Si
rius!” said Hermione accusingly. 
"“I forgot,” said Harry, which was perfectly true; his meeting with "
Cho in the Owlery had dr
iven everything before 
it out of his mind. 
“Don’t look at me li
"ke that, Hermione, ther"
e was no way anyone 
would have got secret information 
"out of it, was th"
"ere, Sirius?” "
 302 "“No, it was very good,” said Sirius"
", smiling. “Anyway, we’d better "
"be quick, just in case we"
’re disturbed — your scar.” 
"“What about — ?” Ron began, but "
"Hermione said quickly, “We’ll "
"tell you afterward, go on, Sirius.” "
"“Well, I know it can’t be fun when it hurts, but we don’t think it’s "
anything to really worry about. It ke
"pt aching all last year, didn’t it?” "
"“Yeah, and Dumbledore said it "
happened whenever Voldemort was 
"feeling a powerful emotion,” said Ha"
"rry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and "
Hermione’s winces. “So maybe he wa
"s just, I dunno, re"
ally angry or 
something the night I 
had that detention.” 
"“Well, now he’s back it’s bound to hurt more often,” said Sirius. "
“So you don’t think it had anything
 to do with Umbridge touching 
me when I was in detentio
n with her?” Harry asked. 
"“I doubt it,” said Sirius. “I know"
 her by reputation and I’m sure 
she’s no Death Eater —” 
"“She’s foul enough to be one,"
” said Harry darkly and Ron and 
Hermione nodded vigoro
usly in agreement. 
"“Yes, but the world isn’"
t split into good people
" and Death Eaters,” "
said Sirius with a wry 
smile. “I know she’s 
"a nasty piece of work, "
though — you should hear Remus talk about her.” 
"“Does Lupin know her?” asked Harry quickly, remembering Um-"
bridge’s comments about dangerou
s half-breeds during her first 
lesson. 
"“No,” said Sirius, “but she drafted "
a bit of anti-werewolf legislation 
two years ago that makes it almost 
impossible for him to get a job.” 
Harry remembered how much shabbi
er Lupin looked these days 
and his dislike of Umbridge
 deepened even further. 
“What’s she got against werewolves?” said Hermione angrily. 
"“Scared of them, I expect,” said Si"
"rius, smiling at her indignation. "
“Apparently she loathes part-human
s; she campaigned to have mer-
people rounded up and tagged last 
year too. Imagine wasting your  
   303 time and energy persecuting merpeo
ple when there are little toerags 
like Kreacher on the loose —” 
Ron laughed but Hermione looked upset. 
“Sirius!” she said 
"reproachfully. “Honestly, if"
 you made a bit of an ef-
fort with Kreacher I’m sure he’d re
"spond, after all, you are the only "
member of his family he’s got left
", and Professor Dumbledore said —” "
“So what are Umbridge’s lessons li
ke?” Sirius interrupted. “Is she 
training you all to 
kill half-breeds?” 
"“No,” said Harry, ignoring Hermio"
ne’s affronted look at being cut 
off in her defense of Kreacher. “She’s
 not letting us use magic at all!” 
“All we do is read the stup
"id textbook,” said Ron. "
"“Ah, well, that figures,” said Sirius. “Our information from inside "
the Ministry is 
that Fudge doesn’t want 
you trained in combat.” 
“
Trained in combat
?”
repeated Harry incredulously. “What does he 
"think we’re doing here, forming "
some sort of wizard army?” 
“That’s exactly what he thinks you’
"re doing,” said Sirius, “or rather, "
that’s exactly what he’s afraid Dumbledore’s doing — forming his 
"own private army, with which he will "
be able to take on the Ministry 
of Magic.” 
"There was a pause at this, then "
"Ron said, “That’s the stupidest "
"thing I’ve ever heard, including "
all the stuff that Luna Lovegood 
comes out with.” 
“So we’re being prevented from le
arning Defense Against the Dark 
Arts because Fudge is scared we’ll us
e spells against the Ministry?” said 
"Hermione, looking furious. "
"“Yep,” said Sirius. “Fudge thinks"
 Dumbledore will stop at nothing 
to seize power. He’s getting more
 paranoid about Dumbledore by the 
day. It’s a matter of time before 
he has Dumbledore arrested on some 
trumped-up charge.” 
This reminded Harry of Percy’s letter. 
“D’you know if there’s going to 
be anything about Dumbledore in  
 304 the 
Daily Prophet 
tomorrow? Only Ron’s brot
her Percy reckons there 
will be —” 
"“I don’t know,” said Sirius, “I "
haven’t seen anyone from the Order 
"all weekend, they’re all busy. It’s just"
 been Kreacher and me here. . . .” 
There was a definite note of 
bitterness in Sirius’s voice. 
“So you haven’t had any news
" about Hagrid, either?” "
"“Ah . . .” said Sirius, “well, he wa"
"s supposed to be back by now, no "
one’s sure what’s happened
" to him.” Then, seeing "
"their stricken faces, "
"he added quickly, “But Dumbledore’s not worried, so don’t you three "
get yourselves in a state; I’m sure Hagrid’s fine.” 
“But if he was supposed to be back by now . . .” said Hermione in 
"a small, worried voice. "
"“Madame Maxime was with him, we’v"
e been in touch with her and 
she says they got separated on the journey home — but there’s noth-
"ing to suggest he’s hurt or — well, "
nothing to suggest he’s not perfectly 
okay.” 
"Unconvinced, Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged worried "
looks. 
"“Listen, don’t go asking too many"
" questions about Hagrid,” said "
"Sirius hastily, “it’ll just draw even "
more attention to the fact that he’s 
"not back, and I know Dumbledore doesn"
"’t want that. Hagrid’s tough, "
"he’ll be okay.” And when they did not appear cheered by this, Sirius "
"added, “When’s your next Hogsme"
ade weekend anyway? I was think-
"ing, we got away with the dog disg"
"uise at the station, didn’t we? I "
thought I could —” 
"“NO!” said Harry and Hermione together, very loudly. "
"“Sirius, didn’t you see the "
Daily Prophet
?” said Hermione anxiously. 
"“Oh that,” said Sirius, grinning, "
“they’re always guessing where I 
"am, they haven’t real"
ly got a clue —” 
"“Yeah, but we think this time th"
"ey have,” said Harry. “Something "
"Malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you, and his fa-"
"ther was on the platform, Sirius "
"— you know, Lucius Malfoy — so "
   305 "don’t come up here, whatever you do, if Malfoy recognizes you "
again —” 
"“All right, all right, I’ve got the "
"point,” said Sirius. He looked most "
displeased. “Just an idea
", thought you might like"
 to get together —” 
"“I would, I just don’t want you "
chucked back in Azkaban!” said 
Harry. 
"There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry, a "
crease between his sunken eyes. 
“You’re less like your father than 
"I thought,” he said finally, a defi-"
nite coolness in his voice. “The ri
sk would’ve been what made it fun 
for James.” 
“Look —” 
"“Well, I’d better get going, I ca"
n hear Kreacher coming down the 
"stairs,” said Sirius, but Harry was sure"
 he was lying. “I’ll write to tell 
you a time I can make it back into 
"the fire, then, shall I? If you can "
stand to risk it?” 
There was a tiny 
"pop,"
 and the place where Sirius’s head had been 
was flickering flame once more. 
They had expected to have
 to comb Hermione’s 
Daily Prophet
carefully next mornin
g to find the articl
e Percy had mentioned 
"in his letter. However, the depart"
ing delivery owl had barely cleared 
the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flat-
tened the newspaper to reveal a 
large photograph of Dolores Um-
"bridge, smiling widely and blinking "
slowly at them from beneath the 
headline: 
MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM 
DOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTED FI
RST-EVER “HIGH INQUISITOR” 
"“‘High Inquisitor’?” said Harry darkly, his half-eaten bit of toast "
slipping from his fi
ngers. “What does 
that
 mean?” 
Hermione read aloud: 
“
In a surprise move last night the 
Ministry of Magic passed new legis-
lation giving itself an unprecedented le
vel of control at Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry.
“‘
The Minister has been growing un
easy about goings-on at Hogwarts
T 
   307 for some time
",’"
" said Junior Assistant to the Minister, Percy Weasley. "
‘
He is 
"now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents, who feel the school "
may be moving in a direct
ion they do not approve.
’ 
“
This is not the first time in recent
 weeks Fudge has used new laws to 
effect improvements at the Wizarding 
school. As recently as August 30th 
"Educational Decree Twenty-two was passed,"
" to ensure that, in the event of "
the current headmaster being unable 
to provide a candidate for a teaching 
"post, the Ministry should se"
lect an appropriate person.
“‘
That’s how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching 
staff at Hogwarts
",’"
 said Weasley last night. 
‘
Dumbledore couldn’t find any-
"one, so the Minister put in Umbridge and of course, she’s been an imme-"
diate success
 —’” 
“She’s been a WHAT?” said Harry loudly. 
"“Wait, there’s more,” said Hermione grimly. "
“‘— 
"an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the teaching of "
Defense Against the Dark Arts and pr
oviding the Minister with on-the-
ground feedback about what’s 
really happenin
g at Hogwarts.
’ 
“
It is this last function that the 
Ministry has now formalized with the 
passing of Educational Decree Twenty
"-three, which creates the new posi-"
tion of 
‘
Hogwarts High Inquisitor.
’ 
“‘
This is an exciting new phase in th
e Minister’s plan to get to grips 
with what some are calling the 
“
falling standards
” 
at Hogwarts
",’"
 said 
Weasley. 
‘
The Inquisitor will have powers 
to inspect her fellow educators 
and make sure that they are coming up to scratch. Professor Umbridge has 
been offered this position in addition
" to her own teaching post, and we are "
delighted to say that she has accepted.
’ 
“
The Ministry’s new moves have rece
ived enthusiastic support from 
parents of studen
ts at Hogwarts.
“‘
I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that Dumbledore is 
"being subjected to fair and objective evaluation,’ said Mr. Lucius Malfoy, "
"41, speaking from his Wiltshire mansio"
n last night. ‘Many of us with our 
children’s best interests at heart 
have been concerned about some of
 308 Dumbledore’s eccentric decisions in the last few years and will be glad to 
know that the Ministry is ke
eping an eye on the situation.
’ 
“
Among those 
‘
eccentric decisions
’ 
are undoubtedly the controversial 
staff appointments previously describe
"d in this newspaper, which have in-"
"cluded the hiring of werewolf Remus Lupin, half giant Rubeus Hagrid, "
and delusional ex-Auror 
‘
Mad-Eye
’ 
Moody.
“
"Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme "
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief 
"Warlock of the Wizengamot, is no long"
er up to the task of managing the 
prestigious school of Hogwarts.
“‘
I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensur-
ing that Hogwarts has a headmaster in
 whom we can all repose confidence
",’ "
said a Ministry insider last night.
“
Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have 
resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.
“‘
"Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge’s office"
",’"
 said 
Madam Marchbanks. 
‘
This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Al-
bus Dumbledore
.’
(
For a full account of Madam Marchbanks’ alleged 
"links to subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17"
).” 
Hermione finished reading and look
ed across the table at the other 
two. 
“So now we know how we ended up
 with Umbridge! Fudge passed 
this ‘Educational Decree’ and forc
ed her on us! And now he’s given 
her the power to inspect other teac
hers!” Hermione was breathing fast 
and her eyes were very bright. “I can’t believe this. It’s 
outrageous.
 . . .” 
"“I know it is,” said Harry. He "
"looked down at his right hand, "
"clenched upon the tabletop, and "
saw the faint white outline of the 
words Umbridge had forced 
him to cut into his skin. 
But a grin wa
s unfurling on Ron’s face. 
“What?” said Harry and Hermio
"ne together, staring at him. "
"“Oh, I can’t wait to see McGonagall inspected,” said Ron happily. "
“Umbridge won’t know
 what’s hit her.” 
   309 "“Well, come on,” said Hermione, "
"jumping up, “we’d better get go-"
"ing, if she’s inspecting Binns’s clas"
s we don’t want to
 be late. . . .” 
But Professor Umbridge was not in
specting their History of Magic 
"lesson, which was just as dull as "
"the previous Monday, nor was she in "
Snape’s dungeon when they arrived 
"for double Potions, where Harry’s "
moonstone essay was handed back to
 him with a larg
"e, spiky black D "
scrawled in an
 upper corner. 
“I have awarded you the grades yo
u would have received if you pre-
"sented this work in your O.W.L,” sa"
"id Snape with a smirk, as he swept "
"among them, passing back their ho"
mework. “This should give you a 
realistic idea of what to ex
pect in your examination.” 
Snape reached the front of the cl
ass and turned to face them. 
“The general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you 
would have failed had this been yo
ur examination. I expect to see a 
great deal more effort for this week’s
 essay on the various varieties of 
"venom antidotes, or I shall have to"
 start handing out detentions to 
those dunces who get D’s.” 
"He smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper, "
“Some people got 
D’s
? Ha!” 
Harry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to see what 
grade he had received; he slid his m
oonstone essay back into his bag as 
"quickly as possible, feeling that he "
would rather keep that information 
private. 
Determined not to give Snape an 
"excuse to fail him this lesson, "
Harry read and reread every line of 
the instructions on the blackboard 
at least three times before acting 
on them. His Strengthening Solution 
was not precisely the clear turquoise 
shade of Hermione’s
 but it was at 
"least blue rather than pink, like Neville’s, and he delivered a flask of it "
to Snape’s desk at the end of the le
sson with a feeling of mingled defi-
ance and relief. 
"“Well, that wasn’t as "
"bad as last week, was it?” said Hermione, as "
they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across 
 310 the entrance hall toward lunch. 
“And the homework didn’t go too 
"badly either, did it?” "
When neither Ron nor Harry answer
"ed, she pressed on, “I mean, "
"all right, I didn’t expect the top grade, not if he’s marking to O.W.L. "
"standard, but a pass is quite encouragi"
"ng at this stage, wouldn’t you "
say?” 
Harry made a noncommitta
l noise in his throat. 
"“Of course, a lot can happen betw"
"een now and the exam, we’ve got "
"plenty of time to improve, but the "
grades we’re getting now are a sort 
"of baseline, aren’t they? Some"
thing we can bu
ild on . . .” 
They sat down together at
 the Gryffindor table. 
"“Obviously, I’d have been "
thrilled
 if I’d gotten an O —” 
"“Hermione,” said Ron sharply, “if "
you want to know what grades 
"we got, ask.” "
"“I don’t — I didn’t mean — well, if you want to tell me —” "
"“I got a P,” said Ro"
"n, ladling soup into"
 his bowl. “Happy?” 
"“Well, that’s nothing to be ashame"
"d of,” said Fred, who had just ar-"
rived at the table with George and 
Lee Jordan and was sitting down on 
Harry’s right. “Nothing wr
ong with a good healthy P.” 
"“But,” said Hermione, “doesn’t P stand for . . .” "
"“‘Poor,’ yeah,” said Lee Jordan. “Still, better than D, isn’t it? "
‘Dreadful’?” 
Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over 
his roll. When he emerged from th
is he was sorry to find that 
Hermione was still in full 
flow about O.W.L. grades. 
“So top grade’s O for ‘Outstandi
"ng,’” she was saying, “and then "
there’s A —” 
"“No, E,” George corrected her, “E for ‘Exceeds Expectations.’ And "
I’ve always thought Fred and I shou
ld’ve got E in ev
"erything, because "
we exceeded expectations just 
by turning up for the exams.” 
"They all laughed except Hermione, who plowed on, “So after E, it’s "
"A for ‘Acceptable,’ and that’s th"
"e last pass grade, isn’t it?” "
   311 "“Yep,” said Fred, dunking an entire "
"roll in his soup, transferring it "
"to his mouth, and swallowing it whole. "
“Then you get P for ‘Poor’” — Ron raised both his arms in mock 
celebration — “and D for ‘Dreadful.’” 
"“And then T,” George reminded him. "
"“T?” asked Hermione, looking ap"
palled. “Even lower than a D? 
What on earth does
 that stand for?” 
"“‘Troll,’” said George promptly. "
"Harry laughed again, though he was not sure whether or not "
George was joking. He imagined t
rying to conceal from Hermione 
that he had received T’s in all his
 O.W.L.s and imme
diately resolved 
to work harder from now on. 
“You lot had an in
spected lesson yet?” Fred asked them. 
"“No,” said Hermione "
"at once, “have you?” "
"“Just now, before lunch,” said George. “Charms.” "
“What was it like?” Harry an
d Hermione asked together. 
Fred shrugged. 
“Not that bad. Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on 
a clipboard. You know what Flitwick’s
" like, he treated her like a guest, "
didn’t seem to bother him at all. 
She didn’t say much
. Asked Alicia a 
"couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Alicia "
"told her they were really good, that was it.” "
“I can’t see old Flitwick gettin
"g marked down,” said George, “he "
usually gets everyone thro
ugh their exams all right.” 
“Who’ve you got this afternoon?” Fred asked Harry. 
“Trelawney —” 
“A T if ever I saw one —” 
“— and Umbridge herself.” 
"“Well, be a good boy and keep your"
" temper with Umbridge today,” "
said George. “Angelina’ll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch 
practices.” 
But Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts 
 312 to meet Professor Umbridge. He was pulling out his dream diary in a 
seat at the very back of the shad
owy Divination room when Ron el-
"bowed him in the ribs and, looking "
"round, he saw Professor Umbridge "
emerging through the trapdoor in th
"e floor. The class, which had been "
"talking cheerily, fell silent at once. "
The abrupt fall in the noise level 
"made Professor Trelawney, who ha"
d been wafting about handing out 
"Dream Oracles,"
 look round. 
"“Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney"
",” said Professor Umbridge "
"with her wide smile. “You received my note, I trust? Giving the time "
and date of your inspection?” 
"Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very disgruntled, "
turned her back on Professor Umbr
idge and continued to give out 
"books. Still smiling, Pr"
ofessor Umbridge grasped the back of the near-
est armchair and pulled it to the fron
t of the class so that it was a few 
inches behind Professor Trelawney’s 
"seat. She then sat down, took her "
"clipboard from her flowery bag, an"
"d looked up expectantly, waiting "
for the class to begin. 
Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly 
trembling hands and surveyed the 
class through her hugely magnify-
ing lenses. “We shall be continuing 
our study of prophetic dreams to-
"day,” she said in a brave attempt at "
"her usual mystic tones, though her "
"voice shook slightly. “Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each "
other’s latest nighttime vi
sions with th
e aid of the 
Oracle.
” 
"She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Um-"
"bridge sitting right beside it, and "
immediately veered 
left toward Par-
"vati and Lavender, who were already "
deep in discussion about Parvati’s 
most recent dream. 
Harry opened his copy of 
"The Dream Oracle,"
 watching Umbridge 
covertly. She was making notes on 
her clipboard now. After a few min-
utes she got to her feet and began 
to pace the room in Trelawney’s 
"wake, listening to her conversation"
s with students and posing ques-
tions here and there. Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book. 
   313 "“Think of a dream, quick,” he to"
"ld Ron, “in case"
 the old toad 
comes our way.” 
"“I did it last time,” Ron protested, “it’s your turn, you tell me one.” "
"“Oh, I dunno . . .” said Harry "
"desperately, who could not remem-"
ber dreaming anything at all over the 
last few days. “Let’s say I dreamed 
I was . . . drowning Snape in my 
"cauldron. Yeah, th"
at’ll do. . . .” 
Ron chortled as he opened his 
Dream Oracle.
"“Okay, we’ve got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the "
number of letters in the subject . . . would that be ‘drowning’ or ‘caul-
dron’ or ‘Snape’?” 
"“It doesn’t matter, pick any of them"
",” said Harry, chancing a glance "
behind him. Professor Umbridge wa
s now standing at Professor Tre-
lawney’s shoulder making notes w
hile the Divination teacher ques-
tioned Neville abou
t his dream diary. 
“What night did you dream this 
"again?” Ron said, immersed in "
calculations. 
"“I dunno, last night, whenever you li"
"ke,” Harry told him, trying to "
listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney. They were 
only a table away from him and 
Ron now. Professor Umbridge was 
making another note on her clip
board and Professor Trelawney was 
looking extremely put out. 
"“Now,” said Umbridge, looking up"
" at Trelawney, “you’ve been in "
"this post how long, exactly?” "
"Professor Trelawney scowled at her, arms crossed and shoulders "
hunched as though wish
ing to protect herself as much as possible 
from the indignity of the inspection. After a slight pause in which she 
seemed to decide that the question
 was not so offensive that she could 
"reasonably ignore it, she said in "
a deeply resentful 
"tone, “Nearly six-"
teen years.” 
"“Quite a period,” said Professor "
"Umbridge, making a note on her "
clipboard. “So it was Professor 
Dumbledore who 
appointed you?” 
"“That’s right,” said Professor Trelawney shortly. "
 314 Professor Umbridge 
made another note. 
“And you are a great-great-grandd
aughter of the celebrated Seer 
Cassandra Trelawney?” 
"“Yes,” said Professor Trelawney, "
holding her head a little higher. 
Another note on the clipboard. 
“But I think — correct me if I 
am mistaken — that you are the 
first in your family si
nce Cassandra to be possessed of second sight?” 
“These things often skip — er — 
"three generations,” said Professor "
Trelawney. 
Professor Umbridge’s to
adlike smile widened. 
"“Of course,” she said sweetly, maki"
"ng yet another note. “Well, if "
you could just predict so
"mething for me, then?” "
"She looked up inquiringly, still "
smiling. Professor Trelawney had 
stiffened as though unab
le to believe her ears. 
"“I don’t understand you,” said "
"Professor Trelawney, clutching con-"
vulsively at the shawl ar
ound her scrawny neck. 
“I’d like you to make a prediction
" for me,” said Professor Umbridge "
very clearly. 
Harry and Ron were not the only 
people watching and listening 
sneakily from behind their books now;
 most of the class were staring 
transfixed at Professor Trelawney as
 she drew herself up to her full 
"height, her beads an"
d bangles clinking. 
“The Inner Eye does not See upon 
command!” she said in scandal-
ized tones. 
"“I see,” said Professor Umbridge so"
"ftly, making yet another note on "
her clipboard. 
“I — but — but . . . 
wait
!”
"said Professor Trelawney suddenly, in "
an attempt at her usual ethereal vo
"ice, though the mystical effect was "
ruined somewhat by the way it was sh
aking with anger. 
“I . . . I think 
I 
do
 see something . . . something that concerns 
you.
 .
. .
"Why, I sense "
something . . . something dark 
. . . some grave peril . . .” 
   315 Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Um-
bridge who continued to smile bl
"andly at her, eyebrows raised. "
“I am afraid . . . I am 
afraid that you are in 
grave danger!” Professor 
Trelawney finished dramatically. 
There was a pause. Professor Umbridge’s eyebrows were still raised. 
"“Right,” she said softly, scribbli"
ng on her clipboard once more. 
"“Well, if that’s "
really the best 
you can do . . .” 
"She turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted "
"to the spot, her chest heaving. Har"
ry caught Ron’s eye and knew that 
Ron was thinking exactly the same
 as he was: They both knew 
that Professor Trelawney was an ol
"d fraud, but on the other hand, "
they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Tre-
lawney’s side — until she swoop
ed down on them a few seconds 
"later, that was. "
"“Well?” she said, snapping her long fingers under Harry’s nose, un-"
characteristically brisk. “Let me 
see the start you’ve made on your 
"dream diary, please.” "
And by the time she had interpre
ted Harry’s dreams at the top of 
"her voice (all of which, even the o"
"nes that involved eating porridge, "
apparently foretold a gruesome and 
"early death), he was feeling much "
less sympathetic toward her. All th
"e while, Professor Umbridge stood "
"a few feet away, making notes on th"
"at clipboard, and when the bell "
rang she descended the silver ladder 
first so that she was waiting for 
them all when they reached their 
Defense Against the Dark Arts les-
son ten minutes later. 
She was humming and smiling to 
herself when they entered the 
"room. Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, "
exactly what had happened in Divinati
on while they all took out their 
copies of 
"Defensive Magical Theory,"
 but before Hermione could ask 
any questions Professor Umbridge had 
called them all to order and si-
lence fell. 
 316 "“Wands away,” she instructed them all smilingly, and those people "
who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to 
their bags. “As we finished chapter one 
"last lesson, I would like you all to "
"turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two, ‘Common De-"
fensive Theories and Their Derivation.’ There will be no need to talk.” 
"Still smiling her wide, self-satisfied"
" smile, she sat down at her desk. "
The class gave an audible sigh as it
" turned, as one, to page nineteen. "
Harry wondered dully whether ther
e were enough chapters in the 
book to keep them reading through 
all this year’s lessons and was on 
the point of checking the contents
 when he noticed that Hermione 
had her hand in the air again. 
Professor Umbridge had noticed 
"too, and what was more, she "
seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality. In-
stead of trying to pretend she ha
"d not noticed Hermione, she got to "
her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were 
"face-to-face, then she bent down and w"
"hispered, so that the rest of the "
"class could not hear, “What is "
"it this time, Miss Granger?” "
"“I’ve already read chapter two,” said Hermione. "
"“Well then, proceed "
to chapter three.” 
“I’ve read that too. I’ve
 read the whole book.” 
Professor Umbridge blinked bu
t recovered her poise almost 
instantly. 
"“Well, then, you should be able "
to tell me what Slinkhard says 
about counterjinxes in chapter fifteen.” 
“He says that counterjinxes are 
"improperly named,” said Hermione "
promptly. “He says ‘counterjinx’ is just a name people give their jinxes 
when they want to make them sound more acceptable.” 
Professor Umbridge raised her 
"eyebrows, and Harry knew she was "
impressed against her will. 
"“But I disagree,” Hermione continued. "
Professor Umbridge’s eyebrows rose 
a little higher and her gaze be-
came distinctly colder. 
   317 “You disagree?” 
"“Yes, I do,” said Hermione, who, "
"unlike Umbridge, was not whis-"
"pering, but speaking in a clear, carr"
ying voice that had by now attracted 
the rest of the class’s attention. “M
"r. Slinkhard doesn’t like jinxes, does "
he? But I think they can be very useful when they’re used defensively.” 
"“Oh, you do, do you?” said Pro"
"fessor Umbridge, forgetting to "
"whisper and straightening up. “Well, "
I’m afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard’s 
"opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss "
Granger.” 
“But —” Hermione began. 
"“That is enough,” said Professor Um"
bridge. She walked back to the 
front of the class and stood before
" them, all the jauntiness she had "
shown at the beginning of the lesso
"n gone. “Miss Granger, I am going "
to take five points fr
om Gryffindor House.” 
There was an outbreak 
of muttering at this. 
“What for?” said 
Harry angrily. 
“Don’t you get involved!” Hermione whispered urgently to him. 
“For disrupting my class with po
"intless interruptions,” said Profes-"
sor Umbridge smoothly. “I am he
re to teach you using a Ministry-
approved method that does not includ
e inviting students to give their 
opinions on matters about which they understand very little. Your pre-
"vious teachers in this subject may have allowed you more license, but "
as none of them — with the possibl
"e exception of Professor Quirrell, "
who did at least appear to have re
stricted himself to
 age-appropriate 
subjects — would have passed
 a Ministry inspection —” 
"“Yeah, Quirrell was a great teache"
"r,” said Harry loudly, “there was "
just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out 
of the back of
 his head.” 
This pronouncement was followed by
 one of the loudest silences 
Harry had ever heard. Then — 
“I think another week’s detentio
"ns would do you some good, Mr. "
"Potter,” said Umbridge sleekly. "
 318 ' '
The cut on the back of Harry’s hand
 had barely healed and by the 
"following morning, it was bleeding "
again. He did not complain dur-
ing the evening’s detention; he was 
determined not to give Umbridge 
the satisfaction; over and over again he wrote 
I must not tell lies
 and not 
"a sound escaped his lips, though th"
e cut deepened with every letter. 
The very worst part of this second 
"week’s worth of detentions was, "
"just as George had predicted, Angelina’s reaction. She cornered him "
just as he arrived at the Gryffindor
 table for breakfast on Tuesday and 
shouted so loudly that Professo
r McGonagall came sweeping down 
upon the pair of them 
from the staff table. 
"“Miss Johnson, how "
dare
 you make such a rack
et in the Great Hall! 
Five points from
 Gryffindor!” 
“But Professor — he’s gone and landed himself in detention 
again
 —” 
"“What’s this, Potter?” said Professo"
"r McGonagall sharply, rounding "
on Harry. “Detention? From whom?” 
"“From Professor Umbridge,” mutt"
"ered Harry, not meeting Profes-"
"sor McGonagall’s beady,"
 square-framed eyes. 
"“Are you telling me,” she said, lowe"
ring her voice so that the group 
of curious Ravenclaws behind them
" could not hear, “that after the "
warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor 
Umbridge’s class again?” 
"“Yes,” Harry muttered, speaking to the floor. "
"“Potter, you must get a grip on yourself! You are heading for seri-"
ous trouble! Another five 
points from Gryffindor!” 
"“But — what? Professor, no!” Harry said, furious at this injustice. "
“I’m already being punished by 
"her,"
 why do you have to take points as 
well?” 
“Because detentions do not appear 
to have any effect on you what- 
   319 soever!” said Professor McGonagall 
"tartly. “No, not another word of "
"complaint, Potter! And as for you,"
" Miss Johnson, you will confine "
your shouting matches to the Quidditc
h pitch in future or risk losing 
the team Captaincy!” 
She strode back toward the staff 
table. Angelina gave Harry a look 
of deepest disgust and stalked away
", upon which Harry flung himself "
onto the bench besi
"de Ron, fuming. "
“She’s taken points off Gryffindor because I’m having my hand 
sliced open every nigh
"t! How is that fair, "
how
?” 
"“I know, mate,” said Ron sympat"
"hetically, tipping bacon onto "
"Harry’s plate, “she’s "
bang out of order.” 
"Hermione, however, merely rustled the pages of her "
Daily Prophet 
and said nothing. 
"“You think McGonagall was right, do you?” said Harry angrily to "
the picture of Cornelius Fudg
e obscuring Hermione’s face. 
“I wish she hadn’t taken points fr
"om you, but I think she’s right to "
"warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge,” said Hermione’s "
"voice, while Fudge gesticulated forc"
"efully from the front page, clearly "
giving some kind of speech. 
Harry did not speak to Hermione
" all through Charms, but when "
they entered Transfiguration he forg
ot his anger; Professor Umbridge 
and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove 
the memory of breakfast right out of his head. 
"“Excellent,” whispered Ron, as th"
ey sat down in their usual seats. 
“Let’s see Umbridge get what she deserves.” 
Professor McGonagall marched into
 the room without giving the 
slightest indication that she knew
 Professor Umbridge was there. 
"“That will do,” she said and silence fell immediately. “Mr. Finni-"
"gan, kindly come here and hand "
"back the homework — Miss Brown, "
please take this box of mice — do
"n’t be silly, girl, "
they won’t hurt 
you — and hand one to each student —” 
 320 “
"Hem, hem,"
"” said Professor Umbridge, "
employing the same silly 
little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night 
of term. Professor McGonagall ignored her. Seamus handed back 
Harry’s essay; Harry took it withou
"t looking at him and saw, to his "
"relief, that he had managed an A. "
"“Right then, everyone, listen clos"
"ely — Dean Thomas, if you do "
that to the mouse again I shall pu
t you in detention — most of you 
have now successfully vanished your
 snails and even those who were 
left with a certain amount
 of shell have the gist of the spell. Today we 
shall be —” 
“
"Hem, hem,"
” said Professor Umbridge. 
“
Yes
"?” said Professor McGonagall, tu"
"rning round, her eyebrows so "
"close together they seemed to form one long, severe line. "
"“I was just wondering, Professor,"
 whether you received my note 
telling you of the date and time of your inspec —” 
"“Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are "
"doing in my classroom,” said Prof"
"essor McGonagall, turning her back "
firmly on Professor Umbridge. Many of the students exchanged looks 
"of glee. “As I was saying, today we "
shall be practicing the altogether 
more difficult vanishment of mi
"ce. Now, the Vanishing Spell —” "
“
"Hem, hem."
” 
"“I wonder,” said Professor McGo"
"nagall in cold fury, turning on "
"Professor Umbridge, “how you expect"
 to gain an idea of my usual 
teaching methods if you continue 
"to interrupt me? You see, I do not "
generally permit people to 
talk when I 
am talking.” 
Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in 
"the face. She did not speak, but "
straightened the parchment on her 
clipboard and began scribbling furi
ously. Looking supremely uncon-
"cerned, Professor McGonagall ad"
dressed the class once more. 
"“As I was saying, the Vanishing Sp"
ell becomes more difficult with 
the complexity of the animal to be 
"vanished. The snail, as an inverte-"
"brate, does not present much of a ch"
"allenge; the mouse, as a mammal, "
   321 offers a much greater one. This is 
"not, therefore, magic you can accom-"
plish with your mind on your dinner
". So — you know the incantation, "
let me see what yo
u can do. . . .” 
“How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with 
Umbridge!” Harry said to Ron unde
"r his voice, but he was grinning; "
his anger with Professor McGo
nagall had quite evaporated. 
Professor Umbridge did not follo
w Professor McGonagall around 
the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she thought 
that Professor McGonagall would no
"t permit it. She did, however, "
take many more notes while she sa
"t in her corner, and when Professor "
McGonagall finally told 
"them all to pack away, "
rose with a grim ex-
pression on her face. 
"“Well, it’s a start,” said Ron, "
"holding up a long, wriggling mouse "
tail and dropping it back into th
e box Lavender was passing around. 
As they filed out of the classr
"oom, Harry saw Professor Umbridge "
approach the teacher’s desk; he nu
"dged Ron, who nudged Hermione "
"in turn, and the three of"
 them deliberately fell
 back to eavesdrop. 
“How long have you been teaching
 at Hogwarts?” Professor Um-
bridge asked. 
"“Thirty-nine years this December,” said Professor McGonagall "
"brusquely, snapping her bag shut. "
Professor Umbridge
 made a note. 
"“Very well,” she said, “you will receive the results of your inspection "
in ten days’ time.” 
"“I can hardly wait,” said Professo"
r McGonagall in a coldly indiffer-
"ent voice, and she strode off toward the door. “Hurry up, you three,” "
"she added, sweeping Harry, Ron, "
and Hermione before her. Harry 
could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he re-
ceived one in return. 
He had thought that the next time he would see Umbridge would 
"be in his detention that evening, bu"
t he was wrong. When they walked 
"down the lawns toward the forest for Care of Magical Creatures, they "
 322 found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside Professor 
Grubbly-Plank. 
"“You do not usually take this class,"
 is that correct
?” Harry heard her 
ask as they arrived at the trestl
e table where the group of captive 
bowtruckles were scrabbling around fo
r wood lice like so many living 
twigs. 
"“Quite correct,” said Professor "
"Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her "
back and bouncing on th
e balls of her feet. “I am a substitute teacher 
standing in for Professor Hagrid.” 
Harry exchanged uneasy looks wi
th Ron and Hermione. Malfoy 
was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; he would surely love this op-
portunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry. 
"“Hmm,” said Professor Umbridge"
", dropping her voice, though "
Harry could still hear he
"r quite clearly, “I wo"
nder — the headmaster 
seems strangely reluctant to give 
me any information on the matter — 
can 
you
 tell me what is causing Profe
ssor Hagrid’s very extended leave 
of absence?” 
Harry saw Malfoy lo
ok up eagerly. 
"“’Fraid I can’t,” said Professor "
Grubbly-Plank breezily. “Don’t 
know anything more about it than you do. Got an owl from Dumble-
"dore, would I like a couple of week"
"s teaching work, accepted — that’s "
as much as I know. 
Well . . . shall I 
get started then?” 
"“Yes, please do,” said Professo"
"r Umbridge, scribbling upon her "
clipboard. 
Umbridge took a different tack in
 this class and wandered among 
"the students, questioning them on "
magical creatures. Most people 
were able to answer well and Harry’
s spirits lifted somewhat; at least 
the class was not letting Hagrid down. 
"“Overall,” said Professor Umbridge"
", returning to Professor Grubbly-"
"Plank’s side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, “how do "
"you, as a temporary memb"
er of staff — an object
"ive outsider, I suppose  "
   323 you might say — how do you find Ho
gwarts? Do you feel you receive 
enough support from the school management?” 
"“Oh, yes, Dumbledore’s excellent,"
” said Professor Grubbly-Plank 
"heartily. “No, I’m very happy with "
"the way things are run, very happy "
indeed.” 
"Looking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny note on her "
"clipboard and went on, “And what ar"
e you planning to cover with this 
"class this year — assuming, of cour"
"se, that Professor Hagrid does not "
return?” 
"“Oh, I’ll take them through the cr"
eatures that most often come up 
"in O.W.L.,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank. “Not much left to do — "
"they’ve studied unicorns and nifflers, I thought we’d cover porlocks and "
"kneazles, make sure they can recognize crups and knarls, you know. . . .” "
"“Well, "
you 
"seem to know what you’re doing, at any rate,” said Pro-"
"fessor Umbridge, making a very obvi"
ous tick on her clipboard. Harry 
did not like the emphasis she put on “
you
” and
liked it even less when 
she put her next question to Goyle: 
"“Now, I hear there have been in-"
juries in this class?” 
Goyle gave a stupid grin. Malfoy 
hastened to answer the question. 
"“That was me,” he said. “I "
was slashed by 
a hippogriff.” 
“A hippogriff?” said Professor Um
"bridge, now scribbling frantically. "
“Only because he was too stupid to
 listen to what Hagrid told him 
"to do,” said Harry angrily. "
Both Ron and Hermione groaned. Professor Umbridge turned her 
head slowly in Harry’s direction. 
"“Another night’s detention, I thin"
"k,” she said softly. “Well, thank "
"you very much, Professor Grubbly-Pl"
"ank, I think that’s all I need "
here. You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten 
days.” 
"“Jolly good,” said Professor Gr"
"ubbly-Plank, and Professor Um-"
bridge set off ba
ck across the lawn to the castle. 
 324 ' '
It was nearly midnight when Harry left
" Umbridge’s office that night, "
his hand now bleeding so severely th
at it was staining the scarf he had 
wrapped around it. He expected the common room to be empty when 
"he returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him. He "
"was pleased to see them, especially as Hermione was disposed to be "
sympathetic rather than critical. 
"“Here,” she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid "
"toward him, “soak your hand in that, it’s a solution of strained and "
pickled murtlap tentacle
"s, it should help.” "
"Harry placed his bleeding, aching ha"
nd into the bowl and experi-
enced a wonderful feeling of relief
. Crookshanks curled around his 
"legs, purring loudly, and then leapt into his lap and settled down. "
"“Thanks,” he said gratefully, scra"
tching behind Crookshanks’s ears 
with his left hand. 
"“I still reckon you should complain about this,” said Ron in a low "
voice. 
"“No,” said Harry flatly. "
“McGonagall would go nu
ts if she knew —” 
"“Yeah, she probably would,” said Harry. “And how long d’you "
reckon it’d take Umbridge to pa
ss another Decree saying anyone who 
complains about the High Inquisit
or gets sacked immediately?” 
Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a 
moment he closed it again in
 a defeated sort of way. 
"“She’s an awful woman,” said "
Hermione in a small voice. “
Awful.
"You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in . . . we’ve got to "
do something about her.” 
"“I suggested poison,”"
 said Ron grimly. 
"“No . . . I mean, something about "
what a dreadful 
"teacher she is, "
and how we’re not going to learn an
"y defense from her at all,” said "
Hermione. 
   325 "“Well, what can we do about that?” said Ron, yawning. “’S too late, "
"isn’t it? She got the job, she’s here to stay, Fudge’ll make sure of that.” "
"“Well,” said Hermione tentatively."
" “You know, I was thinking to-"
day. . . .” She shot a sl
ightly nervous look at Ha
"rry and then plunged on, "
“I was thinking that — maybe the t
ime’s come when we should just — 
just do it ourselves.” 
“Do what ourselves?” said Harry susp
"iciously, still floating his hand "
in the essence of murtlap tentacles. 
“Well — learn Defense Against the 
"Dark Arts ourselves,” said Her-"
mione. 
"“Come off it,” groaned Ron. “You "
want us to do extra work? D’you 
realize Harry and I are behind on 
homework again and it’s only the 
second week?” 
“But this is much more important
 than homework!” said Hermione. 
Harry and Ron goggled at her. 
“I didn’t think there was anything in the universe more important 
"than homework,” said Ron. "
"“Don’t be silly, of course there "
"is!” said Hermione, and Harry saw, "
"with an ominous feeling,"
 that her face was su
ddenly alight with the 
kind of fervor that S.P.E.W. usually inspired in her. “It’s about prepar-
"ing ourselves, like Harry said in Um"
"bridge’s first lesson, for what’s "
waiting out there. It’s about maki
ng sure we really can defend our-
selves. If we don’t learn an
ything for a whole year —” 
"“We can’t do much by ourselves,” sa"
id Ron in a defeated voice. “I 
"mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and "
"practice them, I suppose —” "
"“No, I agree, we’ve gone past the stage where we can just learn "
"things out of books,” "
"said Hermione. “We need a teacher, a proper "
"one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we’re go-"
ing wrong.” 
“If you’re talking about Lu
pin . . .” Harry began. 
"“No, no, I’m not talking about Lu"
"pin,” said Hermione. “He’s too "
 326 "busy with the Order and anyway, the "
most we could see him is during 
Hogsmeade weekends and that’s
 not nearly often enough.” 
"“Who, then?” said Harr"
"y, frowning at her. "
Hermione heaved a very deep sigh. 
“Isn’t it obvious?” she said. “I’m talking about 
you
", Harry.” "
There was a moment’s silence. A 
light night breeze rattled the win-
dowpanes behind Ron and 
the fire guttered. 
“About me what?” said Harry. 
“I’m talking about 
you 
teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts.” 
Harry stared at her. Then he turned
" to Ron, ready to exchange the "
exasperated looks they sometimes 
shared when Hermione elaborated 
on far-fetched schemes like S.P.E.
"W. To Harry’s consternation, how-"
"ever, Ron did not look exasperated. He was frowning slightly, appar-"
ently thinking. Then he 
"said, “That’s an idea.” "
“What’s an idea?” said Harry. 
"“You,” said Ron. “Teaching us to do it.” "
“But . . .” 
"Harry was grinning now, sure the pair"
 of them were pulling his leg. 
"“But I’m not a teacher, I can’t —” "
"“Harry, you’re the best in the ye"
ar at Defense Against the Dark 
"Arts,” said Hermione. "
"“Me?” said Harry, now grinning mo"
re broadly than ever. “No I’m 
"not, you’ve beaten me"
 in every test —” 
"“Actually, I haven’t,” said Hermione coolly. “You beat me in our "
third year — the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who 
actually knew the subject. But I’
"m not talking about test results, "
Harry. Look what you’ve 
done
!” 
“How d’you mean?” 
"“You know what, I’m not sure I wa"
nt someone this stupid teaching 
"me,” Ron said to Hermione, smirki"
ng slightly. He turned to Harry. 
"“Let’s think,” he said, pulling a face"
 like Goyle concentrating. “Uh . . . 
first year — you saved the 
Stone from You-Know-Who.” 
   327 "“But that was luck,” said Harry, “that wasn’t skill —” "
"“Second year,” Ron interrupted, “you killed the basilisk and de-"
stroyed Riddle.” 
"“Yeah, but if Fawkes ha"
dn’t turned up I —” 
"“Third year,” said Ron, louder st"
"ill, “you fought off about a hun-"
dred dementors at once —” 
“You know that was 
"a fluke, if the Time"
-Turner hadn’t —” 
"“Last year,” Ron said, almost shou"
"ting now, “you fought off You-"
Know-Who again —” 
"“Listen to me!” said Harry, al"
"most angrily, because Ron and "
Hermione were both smirking now. 
"“Just listen to me, all right? It "
sounds great when you say it like th
"at, but all that stuff was luck — I "
didn’t know what I was doing half th
"e time, I didn’t plan any of it, I "
"just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help —” "
Ron and Hermione were still smir
king and Harry felt his temper 
rise; he wasn’t even
 sure why he was feeling so angry. 
“Don’t sit there grinning like yo
"u know better than I do, I was "
"there, wasn’t I?” he said heatedly. “I"
" know what went on, all right? And "
I didn’t get through any of that 
because I was brilliant at Defense 
"Against the Dark Arts, I got throug"
h it all because — because help 
"came at the right time, or because "
I guessed right — but I just blun-
"dered through it all, I didn’t have"
 a clue what I was doing — STOP 
LAUGHING!” 
The bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed. He be-
"came aware that he was on his feet, though he couldn’t remember "
standing up. Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa; Ron and 
Hermione’s smiles had vanished. 
“
You don’t know what it’s like
! You — neither of you — you’ve never 
"had to face him, have you? You thin"
k it’s just memorizing a bunch of 
"spells and throwing them at him, like you’re in class or something? "
The whole time you know there’s 
nothing between you and dying ex-
cept your own — your own brain or 
guts or whatever — like you can 
 328 think straight when you know you’re about a second from being mur-
"dered, or tortured, or watching "
your friends die — they’ve never 
"taught us that in their classes, what "
it’s like to deal with things like 
that — and you two sit there acting like I’m a clever little boy to be 
"standing here, alive, like Diggor"
"y was stupid, like he messed up — "
"you just don’t get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would "
have been if Voldemort 
hadn’t needed me —” 
“We weren’t saying anything like 
"that, mate,” said Ron, looking "
aghast. “We weren’t having a go at
" Diggory, we didn’t — you’ve got "
the wrong end of the —” 
He looked helplessly at Herm
"ione, whose face"
 was stricken. 
"“Harry,” she said timidly, “don’t yo"
u see? This . . . this is exactly 
why we need you. . . . We need to know
 what it’s r-really like . . . fac-
ing him . . . facing V-Voldemort.” 
It was the first time she had ever 
"said Voldemort’s name, and it was "
"this, more than anything else, that "
calmed Harry. Stil
"l breathing hard, "
"he sank back into his chair, becoming aware as he did so that his hand "
was throbbing horribly again. He
 wished he had not smashed the 
bowl of murtlap essence. 
“Well . . . think abou
"t it,” said Hermione quietly. “Please?” "
Harry could not think of anything to say. He was feeling ashamed 
"of his outburst already. He nodded, hardly aware of what he was "
agreeing to. 
Hermione stood up. 
"“Well, I’m off to bed,” she said in "
a voice that was cl
early as natural 
as she could make it. 
“Erm . . . ’night.” 
Ron had gotten to his feet too. 
“Coming?” he said awkwardly to Harry. 
"“Yeah,” said Harry. “In "
. . . in a minute. I’ll 
just clear this up.” 
He indicated the smashed bowl on the floor. Ron nodded and left. 
“
"Reparo,"
"” Harry muttered, pointing his "
wand at the broken pieces 
   329  of china. They flew back together
", good as new, but there was no re-"
turning the murtlap essence to the bowl. 
He was suddenly so tired that he wa
s tempted to sink back into his 
"armchair and sleep there, but inst"
ead he got to his feet and followed 
Ron upstairs. His restless night was 
punctuated once more by dreams 
"of long corridors and locked doors,"
 and he awoke next day with his 
scar prickling again. 
Hermione made no mention of 
Harry giving Defense Against 
the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original 
suggestion. Harry’s detentions with 
Umbridge were finally over (he 
doubted whether the words now etch
ed on the back of his hand 
would ever fade entirely); Ron had 
had four more Quidditch practices 
and not been shouted at 
during the last two; an
d all three of them had 
managed to vanish their mice in Transfiguration (Hermione had actu-
ally progressed to vanishing kittens
"), before the subject was broached "
"again, on a wild, blustery evening "
"at the end of September, when the "
three of them were sitting in the li
"brary, looking up potion ingredients "
for Snape. 
"“I was wondering,” Hermione said suddenly, “whether you’d "
"thought any more about Defense Against the Dark Arts, Harry.” "
"“’Course I have,” said Harry grum"
"pily. “Can’t forget it, can we, "
with that hag te
aching us —” 
"“I meant the idea Ron and I had” — Ron cast her an alarmed, "
threatening kind of look; she frow
"ned at him — “oh, all right, the "
idea 
I
" had, then — about you teaching us.” "
H 
   331 Harry did not answer at once. He 
pretended to be 
perusing a page 
of 
"Asiatic Anti-Venoms,"
 because he did not want 
to say what was in his 
mind. 
The fact was that he had given th
e matter a great deal of thought 
over the past fortnight. Sometimes it
" seemed an insane idea, just as it "
had on the night Hermio
"ne had proposed it, but at others, he had "
found himself thinking about the spells
 that had served him best in his 
various encounters with Dark cr
eatures and Death Eaters — found 
"himself, in fact, subconscious"
ly planning lessons. . . . 
"“Well,” he said slowly, when he co"
uld not pretend to find Asiatic 
anti-venoms interesting 
"much longer, “yeah, I — I’ve thought about "
it a bit.” 
“And?” said Hermione eagerly. 
"“I dunno,” said Harry, playing fo"
r time. He looked up at Ron. 
“I thought it was a good idea fr
"om the start,” said Ron, who "
seemed keener to join in this conv
ersation now that he was sure that 
Harry was not going to 
start shouting again. 
Harry shifted uncomfor
tably in his chair. 
“You did listen to what I said abou
"t a load of it being luck, didn’t "
you?” 
"“Yes, Harry,” said Hermione gently"
", “but all the same, there’s no "
point pretending that you’re no
t good at Defense Against the Dark 
"Arts, because you are. You were the only person last year who could "
"throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, "
"you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can’t, Viktor al-"
ways said —” 
Ron looked around at her so fast 
he appeared to crick his neck; rub-
"bing it, he said, “Yeah?"
 What did Vicky say?” 
"“Ho ho,” said Hermione in a bored voice. “He said Harry knew "
"how to do stuff even he didn’t, an"
d he was in the final year at 
Durmstrang.” 
Ron was looking at Hermione suspiciously. 
 332 “You’re not still in cont
"act with him, are you?” "
“So what if I am?” said Hermione 
"coolly, though her face was a lit-"
tle pink. “I can have a pen pal if I —” 
“He didn’t only want to be your
" pen pal,” said Ron accusingly. "
Hermione shook her head exaspera
"tedly and, ignoring Ron, who "
"was continuing to watch her, said to Harry, “Well, what do you think? "
Will you teach us?” 
"“Just you and Ron, yeah?” "
"“Well,” said Hermione, now lookin"
g a mite anxious again. “Well 
". . . now, don’t fly off the handle ag"
"ain, Harry, please. . . . But I really "
"think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn. I mean, we’re "
talking about defending ourselves 
"against V-Voldemort — oh, don’t "
"be pathetic, Ron — it doesn"
’t seem fair if we don
’t offer the chance to 
other people.” 
Harry considered this for a moment
", then said, “Yeah, but I doubt "
anyone except you two would want to
" be taught by me. I’m a nutter, "
remember?” 
"“Well, I think you might be surp"
rised how many people would be 
interested in hearing what you’ve go
"t to say,” said Hermione seriously. "
"“Look,” she leaned toward him; Ron, who was still watching her with "
"a frown on his face, leaned forward "
"to listen too, “you know the first "
weekend in October’s a Hogsmeade 
weekend? How would it be if we 
tell anyone who’s interested to meet
 us in the village
 and we can talk 
it over?” 
“Why do we have to do it outside school?” said Ron. 
"“Because,” said Hermione, returnin"
g to the diagram of the Chinese 
"Chomping Cabbage she was copying,"
 “I don’t think Umbridge would 
be very happy if she found out what we were up to.” 
Harry had been lookin
g forward to the weekend trip into Hogs-
"meade, but there was one thing worryi"
ng him. Sirius had maintained 
a stony silence since he had appeared
 in the fire at the beginning of 
   333 September; Harry knew they had made
 him angry by saying that they 
did not want him to come — but he 
still worried from time to time 
that Sirius might throw caution to
 the winds and turn up anyway. 
What were they going to do if the 
great black dog came bounding up 
"the street toward them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of "
Draco Malfoy? 
"“Well, you can’t blame "
him for wanting to get 
"out and about,” said "
"Ron, when Harry discussed his fea"
rs with him and Hermione. “I 
"mean, he’s been on the run for over "
"two years, hasn’t he, and I know "
"that can’t have been a laugh, but at"
" least he was free, wasn’t he? And "
now he’s just shut up all the time with that lunatic elf.” 
"Hermione scowled at Ron, but ot"
herwise ignored the slight on 
Kreacher. 
"“The trouble is,” she said to Ha"
"rry, “until V-Voldemort — oh for "
heaven’s 
"sake,"
" Ron — comes out into the open,"
 Sirius is going to have 
"to stay hidden, isn’t he? I mean, the "
stupid Ministry isn’t going to re-
alize Sirius is innocent until th
ey accept that Dumbledore’s been 
telling the truth about 
him all along. And once
 the fools start catch-
ing real Death Eaters again it’ll be 
"obvious Sirius isn’t one . . . I mean, "
"he hasn’t got the Mark, for one thing.” "
"“I don’t reckon he’d be stupid enough to turn up,” said Ron brac-"
ingly. “Dumbledore’d go mad if he 
did and Sirius listens to Dumble-
dore even if he doesn’t 
like what he hears.” 
When Harry continued to look wo
"rried, Hermione said, “Listen, "
Ron and I have been sounding ou
t people who we thought might 
want to learn some proper Defense
" Against the Dark Arts, and there "
are a couple who seem interested. We’ve told them to meet us in 
Hogsmeade.” 
"“Right,” said Harry vaguely,"
 his mind still on Sirius. 
"“Don’t worry, Harry,” Hermione sa"
id quietly. “You’ve got enough 
on your plate with
out Sirius too.” 
"She was quite right, of course; he"
 was barely keep
ing up with his 
 334 "homework, though he was doing mu"
ch better now that he was no 
longer spending every evening in 
detention with Umbridge. Ron was 
"even further behind with his work than Harry, because while they "
"both had Quidditch practices twice a week, Ron also had prefect du-"
"ties. However, Hermione, who was taki"
ng more subjects 
than either of 
"them, had not only finished all he"
r homework but was also finding 
time to knit more elf clothes. Harr
y had to admit that she was getting 
better; it was now almost always 
possible to distinguish between the 
hats and the socks. 
The morning of the Hogsmeade visi
t dawned bright but windy. Af-
"ter breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their "
names to the long list of students 
who had permission from their par-
ents or guardian to visit the vill
"age. With a slight pang, Harry re-"
membered that if it hadn’t been 
"for Sirius, he would not have been "
going at all. 
"When Harry reached Filch, the ca"
retaker gave a 
great sniff as 
though trying to detect a whiff 
of something from Harry. Then he 
gave a curt nod that set his jowls 
"aquiver again and Harry walked on, "
out onto the stone steps an
"d the cold, sunlit day. "
“Er — why was Filch sn
iffing you?” asked Ro
"n, as he, Harry, and "
Hermione set off at a brisk pace do
wn the wide drive to the gates. 
"“I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,” said "
Harry with a small laugh. “I forgot to tell you . . .” 
And he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch 
"bursting in seconds later, demanding "
to see the letter. To his slight sur-
"prise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more, in-"
"deed, than he did himself. "
“He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But 
who had tipped him off?” 
"“I dunno,” said Harry, shrugging. “M"
"aybe Malfoy, he’d think it was "
a laugh.” 
They walked between the tall st
one pillars topped with winged 
   335 boars and turned left onto the road
" into the village, the wind whip-"
ping their hair into their eyes. 
"“Malfoy?” said Hermione, very skeptically. “Well . . . yes . . . "
maybe . . .” 
And she remained deep in thought 
all the way into the outskirts of 
Hogsmeade. 
“Where are we going anyway?” Harry asked. “The Three Broom-
sticks?” 
"“Oh — no,” said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, “no, it’s al-"
ways packed and really noisy. I’ve told the others to meet us in the 
"Hog’s Head, that other pub, you know"
" the one, it’s not on the main "
road. I think it’s a bit . . . you know . . . 
dodgy
 . . . but students don’t 
"normally go in there, so I don"
’t think we’ll 
be overheard.” 
"They walked down the main street past Zonko’s Joke Shop, where "
"they were unsurprised to see Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, past the "
"post office, from which owls issued "
"at regular intervals, and turned up "
a side street at the top of which 
stood a small inn. A battered wooden 
sign hung from a rusty 
"bracket over the door, with a picture upon it of "
a wild boar’s severed 
head leaking blood onto 
the white cloth around 
it. The sign creaked in the wind as 
they approached. All three of them 
hesitated outside the door. 
"“Well, come on,” said Hermione slightly nervously. Harry led the "
way inside. 
"It was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose large bar gave an "
impression of gleaming warmth an
d cleanliness. The Hog’s Head bar 
"comprised one small, dingy, and very "
dirty room that smelled strongly 
of something that might have been
 goats. The bay windows were so 
encrusted with grime that very lit
tle daylight could permeate the 
"room, which was lit instead with the "
stubs of candles 
sitting on rough 
wooden tables. The floor seemed at firs
"t glance to be earthy, though as "
Harry stepped onto it he realized 
that there was stone beneath what 
seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries. 
 336 Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning
 this pub in his first year: 
“
"Yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head,"
"” he had said, explaining "
how he had won a dragons egg from 
a hooded stranger there. At the 
time Harry had wondered why Hagrid
 had not found it odd that the 
stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw 
that keeping your face hidden was so
mething of a fashion in the Hog’s 
Head. There was a man at the bar 
whose whole head was wrapped in 
"dirty gray bandages, though he wa"
s still managing to gulp endless 
"glasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his mouth. "
Two figures shrouded in hoods sat at
 a table in one of the windows; 
Harry might have thought them dement
ors if they had not been talk-
ing in strong Yorkshire accents; in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace 
"sat a witch with a thick, black veil th"
at fell to her toes. They could just 
see the tip of her nose be
cause it caused the veil
 to protrude slightly. 
"“I don’t know about this, Herm"
"ione,” Harry muttered, as they "
crossed to the bar. He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled 
witch. “Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that?” 
Hermione cast an 
appraising eye at the veiled figure. 
“Umbridge is shorter than that 
"woman,” she said quietly. “And "
"anyway, even if Umbridge "
does
 come in here there’s nothing she can 
"do to stop us, Harry, because I’ve"
 double- and triple-checked the 
school rules. We’re not out-of-bound
s; I specifically asked Professor 
Flitwick whether studen
"ts were allowed to come in the Hog’s Head, "
"and he said yes, but he advised me "
strongly to bring our own glasses. 
And I’ve looked up everything I ca
n think of about study groups and 
homework groups and they’re definitely
 allowed. I just don’t think it’s 
a good idea if we 
parade
 what we’re doing.” 
"“No,” said Harry dryly, “especially "
as it’s not exactly a homework 
"group you’re planning, is it?” "
The barman sidled toward them 
out of a back room. He was a 
grumpy-looking old man with a grea
t deal of long gray hair and 
beard. He was tall and 
thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry. 
   337 “What?” he grunted. 
"“Three butterbeers, please,” said Hermione. "
The man reached beneath the co
unter and pulled up three very 
"dusty, very dirty bottles, wh"
ich he slammed on the bar. 
"“Six Sickles,” he said. "
"“I’ll get them,” said Harry quickly,"
 passing over th
e silver. The bar-
"man’s eyes traveled over Harry, resting for a fraction of a second on his "
scar. Then he turned away and deposited Harry’s money in an ancient 
wooden till whose drawer slid open 
"automatically to receive it. Harry, "
"Ron, and Hermione retreated to the farthest table from the bar and "
"sat down, looking around, while the "
man in the dirty gray bandages 
rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking 
drink from the barman. 
"“You know what?” Ron murmured, "
looking over at the bar with 
"enthusiasm. “We could order anything we liked in here, I bet that "
"bloke would sell us anything, he woul"
dn’t care. I’ve always wanted to 
try firewhisky —” 
“You — are — a — 
"prefect,"
” snarled Hermione. 
"“Oh,” said Ron, the smile fading"
 from his face. “Yeah . . .” 
"“So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?” Harry asked, "
wrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig. 
"“Just a couple of people,” Hermione repeated, checking her watch "
and then looking anxiously toward th
e door. “I told them to be here 
about now and I’m sure they all kn
"ow where it is — oh look, this "
might be them now —” 
The door of the pub had opened. A 
thick band of dusty sunlight 
"split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the "
incoming rush of 
a crowd of people. 
First came Neville with Dean an
"d Lavender, who were closely fol-"
lowed by Parvati and Padma Patil 
with (Harry’s stomach did a back 
flip) Cho and one of her usually gi
"ggling girlfriends, then (on her own "
and looking so dreamy that she mi
ght have walked in by accident) 
 338 "Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Al"
"icia Spinnet, and Angelina John-"
"son, Colin and Dennis Creevey, "
"Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-"
"Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, and a Hu"
fflepuff girl with
 a long plait 
down her back whose name Harry 
did not know; three Ravenclaw 
boys he was pretty sure were call
"ed Anthony Goldstein, Michael Cor-"
"ner, and Terry Boot; Ginny, followed by"
 a tall skinny blond boy with 
an upturned nose whom Harry recogn
ized vaguely as being a member 
"of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and bringing up the rear, Fred and "
George Weasley with their friend L
"ee Jordan, all three of whom were "
carrying large paper bags cram
med with Zonko’s merchandise. 
“A couple of people?” said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. “A 
couple 
of people
?” 
"“Yes, well, the idea seemed quite "
"popular,” said Hermione happily. "
"“Ron, do you want to pull"
 up some more chairs?” 
The barman had frozen in the act 
of wiping out a glass with a rag 
so filthy it looked as 
though it had never been 
washed. Possibly he had 
never seen his pub so full. 
"“Hi,” said Fred, reaching the bar "
first and counting his companions 
quickly. “Could we ha
ve . . . twenty-five 
"butterbeers, please?” "
The barman glared at him for 
"a moment, then, throwing down "
his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very 
"important, he started passing up "
dusty butterbeers 
from under the 
bar. 
"“Cheers,” said Fred, handing them out. “Cough up, everyone, I "
haven’t got enough gold fo
r all of these. . . .” 
Harry watched numbly as the larg
e chattering group took their 
beers from Fred and rummaged in thei
r robes to find coins. He could 
not imagine what all these people ha
d turned up for until the horrible 
thought occurred to him that they might be expecting some kind of 
"speech, at which he rounded on Hermione. "
“What have you been telling people?”
 he said in a low voice. “What 
are they expecting?” 
   339 "“I’ve told you, they just want to "
"hear what you’ve got to say,” said "
Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously 
"that she added quickly, “Y"
"ou don’t have to do anything yet, I’ll speak "
to them first.” 
"“Hi, Harry,” said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite "
Harry. 
"Harry tried to smile back, but did "
not speak; his mouth was excep-
tionally dry. Cho had just smiled 
at him and sat down 
on Ron’s right. 
"Her friend, who had curly reddish-b"
"londe hair, did not smile, but "
gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful 
"look that told Harry plainly that, "
"given her way, she would "
not be here at all. 
In twos and threes the new arriva
"ls settled around Harry, Ron, and "
"Hermione, some looking rather exci"
"ted, others curious, Luna Love-"
good gazing dreamily into space.
 When everybody had pulled up a 
"chair, the chatter died out."
 Every eye was upon Harry. 
"“Er,” said Hermione, her voice slig"
htly higher than usual out of 
nerves. “Well — er — hi.” 
"The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes con-"
tinued to dart back regularly to Harry. 
"“Well . . . erm . . . well, you know why you’re here. Erm . . . well, "
Harry here had the idea — I mean
” — Harry had thrown her a sharp 
look — “I had the idea
 — that it might be
 good if people who 
wanted to study Defense Against th
"e Dark Arts — and I mean, really "
"study it, you know, not the rubbish"
 that Umbridge is doing with 
us” — (Hermione’s voice became su
ddenly much stronger and more 
confident) — “because nobody co
uld call that Defense Against the 
"Dark Arts” — “Hear, hear,” said "
"Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione "
"looked heartened — “well, I thought it would be good if we, well, "
took matters into our own hands.” 
"She paused, looked sideways at Har"
"ry, and went on, “And by that I "
mean learning how to defend oursel
"ves properly, not just theory but "
the real spells —” 
 340 “You want to pass your Defense Ag
ainst the Dark Arts O.W.L. too 
"though, I bet?” said"
 Michael Corner. 
"“Of course I do,” said Hermione at once. “But I want more than "
"that, I want to be properly trained in Defense because . . . because . . .” "
She took a great breath and fini
"shed, “Because Lord Voldemort’s "
back.” 
The reaction was immediate and pred
ictable. Cho’s friend shrieked 
"and slopped butterbeer down herself,"
 Terry Boot gave a kind of invol-
"untary twitch, Padma Patil shuddere"
"d, and Neville gave an odd yelp "
"that he managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked "
"fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry. "
"“Well . . . that’s the plan anyway,”"
 said Hermione. “If you want to 
"join us, we need to deci"
de how we’re going to —” 
“Where’s the proof You-Know-Who’s back?” said the blond Huffle-
puff player in a rath
er aggressive voice. 
"“Well, Dumbledore believes"
 it —” Hermione began. 
"“You mean, Dumbledore believes "
"him,"
"” said the blond boy, nod-"
ding at Harry. 
“Who are 
you
?” said Ron rather rudely. 
"“Zacharias Smith,” said the boy, “a"
nd I think we’ve got the right to 
know exactly what makes 
him
 say You-Know-Who’s back.” 
"“Look,” said Hermione, intervening swiftly, “that’s really not what "
this meeting was suppos
ed to be about —” 
"“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry. "
It had just dawned upon him why th
ere were so many people there. 
He felt that Hermione sh
ould have seen this coming. Some of these 
people — maybe even most of them 
— had turned up in the hope of 
hearing Harry’s st
ory firsthand. 
"“What makes me say You-Know-Who’s back?” he asked, looking "
Zacharias straight in the face. “I
 saw him. But Dumbledore told the 
whole school what happened last year
", and if you didn’t believe him,  "
   341 "you don’t believe me, and I’m not wa"
sting an afternoon trying to con-
vince anyone.” 
The whole group seemed to have he
ld its breath while Harry spoke. 
Harry had the impression that even 
the barman was listening in. He 
was wiping the same glass with the fi
lthy rag; it was becoming steadily 
dirtier. 
"Zacharias said dismissively, “All "
Dumbledore told us last year was 
that Cedric Diggory got killed by You-Know-Who and that you 
brought Diggory’s body back to Hogwar
"ts. He didn’t give us details, "
"he didn’t tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we’d all "
like to know —” 
“If you’ve come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort 
"murders someone I can’t help you,” "
"Harry said. His temper, always so "
"close to the surface these days, was "
rising again. He did not take his 
eyes from Zacharias Smith’s aggressive
" face, determined not to look at "
Cho. “I don’t want to talk about Cedr
"ic Diggory, all right? So if that’s "
"what you’re here for, you "
might as well clear out.” 
He cast an angry look in
" Hermione’s direction. This was, he felt, all "
her fault; she had decided to display 
him like some sort of freak and of 
course they had all turned up to s
ee just how wild his story was. . . . 
"But none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though he "
continued to gaze intently at Harry. 
"“So,” said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again. “So . . . "
"like I was saying . . . if you want to learn some defense, then we need "
to work out how we’re going to do 
"it, how often we’re going to meet, "
and where we’re going to —” 
"“Is it true,” interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back, "
"looking at Harry, “that yo"
u can produce a Patronus?” 
There was a murmur of interest
 around the group at this. 
"“Yeah,” said Harry slightly defensively. "
“A corporeal Patronus?” 
 342 The phrase stirred someth
ing in Harry’s memory. 
“Er — you don’t know
" Madam Bones, do "
you?” he asked. 
The girl smiled. 
"“She’s my auntie,” she said. “I’m"
 Susan Bones. She told me about 
your hearing. So — is 
it really true? You ma
ke a stag Patronus?” 
"“Yes,” said Harry. "
"“Blimey, Harry!” said Lee, looking "
deeply impressed. “I never knew 
that!” 
“Mum told Ron not to spread it 
"around,” said Fred, grinning at "
Harry. “She said you got en
ough attention as it was.” 
"“She’s not wrong,” mumbled Harry and a couple of people "
laughed. The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat. 
“And did you kill a basilisk with
 that sword in Dumbledore’s of-
fice?” demanded Terry Boot. “That’s 
what one of the portraits on the 
wall told me when I was in there last year. . . .” 
"“Er — yeah, I did, ye"
"ah,” said Harry. "
"Justin Finch-Fletchley whistled, "
the Creevey brothers exchanged 
"awestruck looks, and Lavender Brown said “wow” softly. Harry was "
feeling slightly hot around the collar
 now; he was determinedly look-
ing anywhere but at Cho. 
"“And in our first year,” said Nevill"
"e to the group at large, “he saved "
that Sorcerou
s Stone —” 
"“Sorcerer’s,” hissed Hermione. "
"“Yes, that, from You-Know-Who,” finished Neville. "
Hannah Abbott’s eyes were as round as Galleons. 
"“And that’s not to mention,” said"
 Cho (Harry’s eyes snapped onto 
"her, she was looking at him, smilin"
g; his stomach did another somer-
"sault), “all the tasks he had to get "
through in the Triwizard Tournament 
last year — getting past dragons 
and merpeople and acromantulas and 
things. . . .” 
There was a murmur of impresse
d agreement around the table. 
   343 Harry’s insides were squirming. He was trying to arrange his face so 
that he did not look to
o pleased with himself. 
The fact that Cho had 
"just praised him made it much, much"
 harder for him to say the thing 
he had sworn to himsel
f he would tell them. 
"“Look,” he said and everyone fell sil"
"ent at once, “I . . . I don’t want "
"to sound like I’m trying to be modest or anything, but . . . I had a lot "
of help with all th
at stuff. . . .” 
"“Not with the dragon, you didn’t,”"
 said Michael Corner at once. 
“That was a seriously cool
 bit of flying. . . .” 
"“Yeah, well —” said Harry, feeling it"
 would be churlish to disagree. 
“And nobody helped you get rid 
"of those dementors this summer,” "
said Susan Bones. 
"“No,” said Harry, “no, okay, I know I did bits of it without help, "
but the point I’m trying to make is —” 
“Are you trying to weasel out of sh
owing us any of this stuff?” said 
Zacharias Smith. 
"“Here’s an idea,” said Ron loudly"
", before Harry could speak, “why "
don’t you shut your mouth?” 
Perhaps the word “weasel” had affe
cted Ron particularly strongly; 
"in any case, he was now looking at "
Zacharias as though he would like 
nothing better than to th
ump him. Zacharias flushed. 
"“Well, we’ve all turned up to lear"
"n from him, and now he’s telling "
"us he can’t really do any of it,” he said. "
"“That’s not what he said,” snarled Fred Weasley. "
“Would you like us to clean ou
t your ears for you?” inquired 
"George, pulling a long and lethal-l"
ooking metal instrument from in-
side one of the Zonko’s bags. 
"“Or any part of your body, really"
", we’re not fussy where we stick "
"this,” said Fred. "
"“Yes, well,” said Hermione hastily, "
"“moving on . . . the point is, are "
we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry?” 
 344 There was a murmur of general ag
reement. Zacharias folded his 
"arms and said nothing, though pe"
rhaps this was be
cause he was too 
busy keeping an eye on the instrument in George’s hand. 
"“Right,” said Hermione, looking "
relieved that so
mething had at 
"last been settled. “Well,"
" then, the next question"
 is how often we do it. 
I really don’t think there’s any po
int in meeting less than once a 
week —” 
"“Hang on,” said Angelina, “we need to make sure this doesn’t clash "
with our Quidditch practice.” 
"“No,” said Cho, “n"
or with ours.” 
"“Nor ours,” added Zacharias Smith. "
“I’m sure we can find a night th
"at suits everyone,” said Hermione, "
"slightly impatiently, “but you know, "
"this is rather important, we’re "
talking about learning to defend 
ourselves against V-Voldemort’s 
Death Eaters —” 
“Well said!” barked Ernie Macm
"illan, whom Harry had been ex-"
pecting to speak long before this. “P
ersonally I think this is really im-
"portant, possibly more important than"
" anything else we’ll do this year, "
even with our O.W.L.s coming up!” 
"He looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry, "
"“Surely not!” When nobody spoke, he"
" went on, “I, personally, am at a "
loss to see why the Minist
ry has foisted such a us
eless teacher upon us 
at this critical period. 
Obviously they are in denial about the return of 
"You-Know-Who, but to give"
 us a teacher who is trying to actively pre-
vent us from using defensive spells —” 
“We think the reason Umbridge doe
sn’t want us trained in Defense 
"Against the Dark Arts,” said Hermio"
"ne, “is that she’s got some . . . "
some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school 
as a kind of private army. She thin
ks he’d mobilize us against the 
Ministry.” 
Nearly everybody looked stunned at this news; everybody except  
   345 "Luna Lovegood, who piped up, “Well,"
" that makes sense. After all, "
Cornelius Fudge has got 
his own private army.” 
"“What?” said Harry, completely th"
rown by this unexpected piece 
of information. 
"“Yes, he’s got an army of heli"
"opaths,” said Luna solemnly. "
"“No, he hasn’t,” snapped Hermione. "
"“Yes, he has,” said Luna. "
“What are heliopaths?” aske
"d Neville, looking blank. "
"“They’re spirits of fire,” said Lu"
"na, her protuberant eyes widening "
so that she looked madder than ever
. “Great tall flaming creatures that 
gallop across the ground burnin
g everything in front of —” 
"“They don’t exist, Neville,” said Hermione tartly. "
“Oh yes they do!” said Luna angrily. 
"“I’m sorry, but where’s the "
proof
 of that?” snapped Hermione. 
“There are plenty of eyewitness a
"ccounts, just because you’re so "
narrow-minded you need to have ev
erything shoved under your nose 
before you —” 
“
"Hem, hem,"
” said Ginny in such a good imitation of Professor Um-
bridge that several people looked 
around in alarm and then laughed. 
“Weren’t we trying to decide how 
often we’re going to meet and get 
Defense lessons?” 
"“Yes,” said Hermione at once, “yes"
", we were, you’re"
 right. . . .” 
"“Well, once a week sounds"
" cool,” said Lee Jordan. "
“As long as —” began Angelina. 
"“Yes, yes, we know about the Qui"
"dditch,” said Hermione in a tense "
"voice. “Well, the other thing to "
decide is where we’re going to 
meet. . . .” 
This was rather more difficul
t; the whole group fell silent. 
“Library?” suggested Katie 
Bell after a few moments. 
“I can’t see Madam Pince being too 
chuffed with us doing jinxes in 
"the library,” said Harry. "
 346 “Maybe an unused cl
assroom?” said Dean. 
"“Yeah,” said Ron, “McGonagall might let us have hers, she did "
when Harry was practicing 
for the Triwizard. . . .” 
But Harry was pretty certain that 
McGonagall would not be so ac-
commodating this time. For all that Hermione had said about study 
"and homework groups being allowed,"
 he had the distinct feeling this 
one might be considered 
a lot more rebellious. 
"“Right, well, we’ll try to find so"
"mewhere,” said Hermione. “We’ll "
send a message round to everybody 
when we’ve got a time and a place 
for the first meeting.” 
She rummaged in her bag and pr
"oduced parchment and a quill, "
"then hesitated, rather as though"
 she was steeling herself to say 
something. 
“I-I think everybody should writ
"e their name down, just so we "
know who was here. But I also thin
"k,” she took a de"
"ep breath, “that "
we all ought to agree not to shout about what we’re doing. So if you 
"sign, you’re agreeing not to tell Umbridge — or anybody else — what "
we’re up to.” 
Fred reached out for the parchm
ent and cheerfully put down his 
"signature, but Harry noticed at once"
 that several people looked less 
than happy at the pros
pect of putting thei
r names on the list. 
“Er . . .” said Zacharias slowly
", not taking the parchment that "
George was trying to pass him. “Well 
. . . I’m sure Ernie will tell me 
when the meeting is.” 
But Ernie was looking rather hesi
tant about signing too. Hermione 
raised her eyebrows at him. 
"“I — well, we are "
"prefects,"
” Ernie burst out. “And if this list was 
"found . . . well, I mean to say . . . "
"you said yourself, if Umbridge finds "
out . . .” 
“You just said this group was 
the most important thing you’d do 
"this year,” Harr"
y reminded him. 
"“I — yes,” said Ernie, “yes, I do believe that, it’s just . . .” "
   347 "“Ernie, do you really think I’d leave that list lying around?” said "
Hermione testily. 
"“No. No, of course not,” said Erni"
"e, looking slightly less anxious. "
"“I — yes, of course I’ll sign.” "
Nobody raised objections afte
"r Ernie, though Harry saw Cho’s "
friend give her a rather reproach
ful look before adding her name. 
"When the last person — Zacharias — had signed, Hermione took "
the parchment back and sl
ipped it carefully into her bag. There was an 
odd feeling in the group now. It was 
as though they had just signed 
some kind of contract. 
"“Well, time’s ticking on,” said Fr"
"ed briskly, getting to his feet. "
"“George, Lee, and I have got items "
"of a sensitive nature to purchase, "
we’ll be seeing you all later.” 
In twos and threes the rest of th
e group took their leave too. Cho 
made rather a business of fastening 
the catch on her 
bag before leav-
"ing, her long dark curtain of hair"
" swinging forward to hide her face, "
"but her friend stood beside her, arms"
" folded, clicking her tongue, so "
that Cho had little choice but to leave with her. As her friend ushered 
"her through the door, Cho looked"
 back and waved at Harry. 
"“Well, I think that went quite well"
",” said Hermione happily, as she, "
"Harry, and Ron walked out of the Ho"
g’s Head into the bright sunlight 
"a few moments later, Harry and Ron "
still clutching their bottles of 
butterbeer. 
"“That Zacharias bloke’s a wart,” said Ron, who was glowering after "
the figure of Smith just discernible in the distance. 
"“I don’t like him much either,” "
"admitted Hermione, “but he over-"
heard me talking to Ernie and Hanna
h at the Hufflepu
ff table and he 
"seemed really interested in coming, "
so what could I say? But the more 
"people the better really — I mean, Michael Corner and his friends "
wouldn’t have come if
 he hadn’t been going out with Ginny —” 
"Ron, who had been draining the la"
st few drops from his butterbeer 
"bottle, gagged and sprayed "
butterbeer down his front. 
 348 "“He’s WHAT?” said Ron, outraged"
", his ears now resembling curls "
of raw beef. “She’s going out with — my sister’s going — what d’you 
"mean, Michael Corner?” "
"“Well, that’s why he and his frie"
"nds came, I think — well, they’re "
obviously interested in learning 
"defense, but if Ginny hadn’t told "
Michael what was going on —” 
“When did this — wh
en did she — ?” 
“They met at the Yule Ball and they got together at the end of last 
"year,” said Hermione composedly. "
They had turned into the High 
Street and she paused outside Scri
"venshaft’s Quill Shop, where there "
was a handsome display of pheasant
-feather quills in the window. 
“Hmm . . . I could do
 with a new quill.” 
She turned into the shop. Ha
rry and Ron followed her. 
“Which one was Michael Corner?” Ron demanded furiously. 
"“The dark one,” said Hermione. "
"“I didn’t like him,”"
 said Ron at once. 
"“Big surprise,” said He"
rmione under her breath. 
"“But,” said Ron, following Hermione along a row of quills in cop-"
"per pots, “I thought Ginny fancied Harry!” "
Hermione looked at him rather
 pityingly and 
shook her head. 
“Ginny 
used
" to fancy Harry, but she gave"
 up on him months ago. 
Not that she doesn’t 
like
" you, of course,” she added kindly to Harry "
while she examined a long black-and-gold quill. 
"Harry, whose head was still full of "
"Cho’s parting wave, did not find "
this subject quite as interesting as
" Ron, who was positively quivering "
"with indignation, but it"
 did bring something ho
me to him that until 
now he had not really registered. 
“So that’s why she talks now?” he 
asked Hermione. “She never used 
to talk in fr
ont of me.” 
"“Exactly,” said Hermione"
". “Yes, I think I’ll ha"
ve this one. . . .” 
She went up to the counter and handed over fifteen Sickles and two 
"Knuts, Ron still breathing down her neck. "
   349 "“Ron,” she said severely as she tur"
"ned and trod on his feet, “this is "
exactly why Ginny hasn’t told you 
"she’s seeing Michael, she knew "
"you’d take it badly. So don’t harp on about it, for heaven’s sake.” "
"“What d’you mean, who’s taking an"
ything badly? I’m not going to 
harp on
 about anything . . .” 
Ron continued to chunter under 
his breath all the way down the 
street. Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry and then said in an under-
"tone, while Ron was muttering impr"
"ecations about Michael Corner, "
“And talking about Michael and 
Ginny . . . what about Cho and 
you?” 
“What d’you mean?” sa
id Harry quickly. 
It was as though boil
ing water was rising rapidly inside him; a 
burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold — 
had he been th
at obvious? 
"“Well,” said Hermione, smiling slight"
"ly, “she just couldn’t keep her "
eyes
" off you, could she?” "
Harry had never before appreciated ju
st how beautiful 
the village of 
Hogsmeade was. 
Harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done 
all term. He and Ron spent mu
ch of Sunday catching up 
"with all their homework again, an"
d although this could hardly be 
"called fun, the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than "
"sitting hunched over tables in the common room, they took their work "
outside and lounged in the shade of 
a large beech tree on the edge of 
"the lake. Hermione, who of course was up to date with all her work, "
brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting nee-
dles so that they flashed and clicke
"d in midair beside her, producing "
more hats and scarves. 
The knowledge that they were doing something to resist Umbridge 
"and the Ministry, and that he was "
"a key part of the rebellion, gave "
Harry a feeling of immense satisfacti
on. He kept reliving Saturday’s 
meeting in his mind: all those peop
"le, coming to him to learn Defense "
Against the Dark Arts . . . and the 
looks on their faces as they had 
heard some of the things he had done . . . and Cho praising his per-
formance in the Triwizard Tourname
nt. . . . The knowledge that all 
H 
   351  those people did not think him a ly
"ing weirdo, but so"
meone to be ad-
"mired, buoyed him up so much that"
 he was still cheerful on Monday 
"morning, despite the imminent prospect of all his least favorite classes. "
He and Ron headed downstairs fr
"om their dormitory together, dis-"
cussing Angelina’s idea that they were to work on a new move called 
the Sloth Grip Roll during that 
"night’s Quidditch practice, and not "
until they were halfway across the 
sunlit common room did they no-
tice the addition to the room that
 had already attracted the attention 
of a small group of people. 
A large sign had been affixed to 
"the Gryffindor notice board, so "
large that it covered everything el
se on there — the lists of second-
"hand spellbooks for sale, the regular reminders of school rules from "
"Argus Filch, the Quidditch team training schedule, the offers to barter "
"certain Chocolate Frog cards for others, the Weasleys’ new advertise-"
"ment for testers, the dates of th"
"e Hogsmeade weekends, and the lost-"
and-found notices. The new sign was 
printed in large black letters and 
there was a highly official-looking 
seal at the bottom
 beside a neat 
and curly signature.

Harry and Ron read the notice over the heads of some anxious-
looking second years. 
“Does this mean they’re going to
 shut down the Gobstones Club?” 
one of them asked his friend. 
"“I reckon you’ll be okay with Gobstones,” Ron said darkly, making "
the second year jump. “I don’t t
"hink we’re going to be as lucky, "
"though, do you?” he asked Harry as"
 the second years hurried away. 
Harry was reading the notice thro
ugh again. The happiness that 
had filled him since Saturday was gone. His insides were pulsing with 
rage. 
"“This isn’t a coincidence,” he said"
", his hands forming fists. “She "
knows.” 
"“She can’t,” said Ron at once. "
“There were people listening in that
" pub. And let’s face it, we don’t "
know how many of the people who tu
rned up we can trust. . . . Any 
of them could have run off and told Umbridge. . . .” 
And he had thought they believed
" him, thought they even admired "
him . . . 
“Zacharias Smith!” said Ron at on
"ce, punching a fist into his hand. "
“Or — I thought that Michael Corner 
had a really shifty look too —” 
   353 “I wonder if Hermione’s seen this
" yet?” Harry said, looking around "
at the door to the 
girls’ dormitories. 
"“Let’s go and tell her,” said Ron."
" He bounded forward, pulled open "
"the door, and set off up "
the spiral staircase. 
He was on the sixth stair when it
" happened. There was a loud, wail-"
"ing, klaxonlike sound and the steps melted together to make a long, "
smooth stone slide. There was a bri
ef moment when Ron tried to keep 
"running, arms working madly like "
"windmills, then he toppled over "
backward and shot down the newly cr
"eated slide, coming to rest on "
his back at Harry’s feet. 
"“Er — I don’t think we’re allowed in the girls’ dormitories,” said "
"Harry, pulling Ron to his feet and trying not to laugh. "
Two fourth-year girls came zoomin
g gleefully down the stone slide. 
"“Oooh, who tried to get upstairs?” "
"they giggled happily, leaping to "
their feet and ogli
ng Harry and Ron. 
"“Me,” said Ron, who was still rath"
er disheveled. “I didn’t realize 
"that would happen. It’s not fair!” he added to Harry, as the girls "
"headed off for the portrait hole, st"
ill giggling madly. “Hermione’s al-
"lowed in our dormitory, how co"
me we’re not allowed — ?” 
"“Well, it’s an old-fashioned rule,”"
" said Hermione, who had just slid "
neatly onto a rug in front of them
" and was now getting to her feet, "
“but it says in 
"Hogwarts, A History"
 that the founders thought boys 
were less trustworthy than girls. 
"Anyway, why were you trying to get "
in there?” 
“To see you — look at this!” said 
"Ron, dragging her over to the no-"
tice board. 
Hermione’s eyes slid rapidly down the notice. Her expression be-
came stony. 
“Someone must have blabbed 
to her!” Ron sa
id angrily. 
"“They can’t have done,” said"
 Hermione in a low voice. 
"“You’re so naive,” said Ron, “you "
think just because you’re all hon-
orable and trustworthy —” 
 354 "“No, they can’t have done because "
I put a jinx on that piece of 
"parchment we all signed,” said He"
"rmione grimly. “Believe me, if any-"
one’s run off and told 
"Umbridge, we’ll know exactly who they are and "
they will really regret it.” 
“What’ll happen to them
?” said Ron eagerly. 
"“Well, put it this way,” said Herm"
"ione, “it’ll make Eloise Midgen’s "
"acne look like a couple of cute freckles. Come on, let’s get down to "
breakfast and see what the others thin
k. . . . I wonder whether this has 
been put up in all the Houses?” 
It was immediately appa
rent on entering the 
Great Hall that Um-
bridge’s sign had not only appeared
 in Gryffindor Tower. There was a 
peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra measure of move-
ment in the Hall as people scurried up and down their tables confer-
ring on what they had read. Harr
"y, Ron, and Hermione had barely "
"taken their seats when Neville, De"
"an, Fred, George, and Ginny de-"
scended upon them. 
“Did you see it?” 
“D’you reckon she knows?” 
“What are we going to do?” 
They were all looking at Harry. He
 glanced around to make sure 
there were no teachers near them. 
"“We’re going to do it anyway, of"
" course,” he said quietly. "
"“Knew you’d say that,” said George, beaming and thumping Harry "
on the arm. 
“The prefects as well?” said Fred
", looking quizzically at Ron and "
Hermione. 
"“Of course,” said Hermione coolly. "
“Here comes Ernie and Hannah Abbo
"tt,” said Ron, looking over "
his shoulder. 
“And
 those Ravenclaw blokes and Smith . . . and no one 
looks very spotty.” 
Hermione looked alarmed. 
"“Never mind spots, the idiots can’"
"t come over here now, it’ll look "
   355 really suspicious — sit down!” sh
"e mouthed to Ernie and Hannah, "
gesturing frantically to them to re
join the Hufflepuff table. “Later! 
We’ll — talk — to — you — 
later
!” 
"“I’ll tell Michael,” said Ginny impatiently, swinging herself off her "
"bench. “The fool, "
honestly . . .” 
She hurried off toward the Ravenc
law table; Harry watched her go. 
"Cho was sitting not far away, talkin"
g to the curly-haired friend she 
had brought along to the Hog’s Head
. Would Umbridge’s notice scare 
her off meeting them again? 
But the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were 
leaving the Great Hall for History of Magic. 
“Harry! 
Ron
!” 
It was Angelina and she was hur
rying toward them looking per-
fectly desperate. 
"“It’s okay,” said Harry quietly, "
when she was near enough to hear 
him. “We’re still going to —” 
“You realize she’s including Quidditc
h in this?” Angelina said over 
him. “We have to go and ask permi
ssion to re-form the Gryffindor 
team!” 
“
What
?”
said Harry. 
"“No way,” said Ron, appalled. "
"“You read the sign, it mentions team"
"s too! So listen, Harry . . . I am "
saying this for the la
"st time. . . . Please, "
please
 don’t lose your temper 
with Umbridge again or she mi
ght not let us play anymore!” 
"“Okay, okay,” said Harry, for Ange"
lina looked as though she was on 
the verge of tears. “Don’t worr
"y, I’ll behave myself. . . .” "
"“Bet Umbridge is in History of Magic,” said Ron grimly, as they set "
off for Binns’s lesson. “She hasn’t inspected Binns yet. . . . Bet you 
anything she’s there. . . .” 
But he was wrong; the only teacher present when they entered was 
"Professor Binns, floating an inch or"
 so above his chair as usual and 
preparing to continue 
his monotonous drone 
on giant wars. Harry 
 356 did not even attempt to follow what
 he was saying today; he doodled 
idly on his parchment ignoring 
Hermione’s frequent glares and 
"nudges, until a particularly painful po"
ke in the ribs ma
de him look up 
angrily. 
“
What
?” 
She pointed at the window. Har
ry looked around. Hedwig was 
"perched on the narrow window ledge, gazing through the thick glass "
"at him, a letter tied to her leg. Ha"
rry could not understand it; they had 
"just had breakfast, why on earth hadn"
"’t she delivered the letter then, as "
usual? Many of his classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other 
too. 
"“Oh, I’ve always loved that owl, she’s so beautiful,” Harry heard "
Lavender sigh to Parvati. 
He glanced around at Professor Binns who continued to read his 
"notes, serenely unaware that the cl"
ass’s attention was even less focused 
upon him than usual. Harry slippe
"d quietly off his chair, crouched "
"down, and hurried along the row to the window, where he slid the "
catch and opened it very slowly. 
He had expected Hedwig to hold 
out her leg so that he could re-
move the letter and then fly off to
" the Owlery, but the moment the "
window was open wide enough she 
"hopped inside, hooting dolefully. "
He closed the window with an an
"xious glance at Professor Binns, "
"crouched low again, and sped back to his seat with Hedwig on his "
"shoulder. He regained his seat, transferred Hedwig to his lap, and "
made to remove the letter tied to her leg. 
It was only then that he realized
 that Hedwig’s feathers were oddly 
ruffled; some were bent the wrong 
"way, and she was holding one of "
her wings at an odd angle. 
"“She’s hurt!” Harry whispered, b"
ending his head low over her. 
Hermione and Ron leaned in cl
oser; Hermione even put down her 
quill. “Look — there’s somet
hing wrong with her wing —” 
Hedwig was quivering; when Harry made to touch the wing she 
   357 "gave a little jump, all her feathers "
on end as though she was inflating 
"herself, and gazed at him reproachfully. "
"“Professor Binns,” said Harry loudly, and everyone in the class "
turned to look at him. “I’m not feeling well.” 
Professor Binns raised his eyes fr
"om his notes, looking amazed, as "
"always, to find the room in "
front of him fu
ll of people. 
“Not feeling well?” he repeated hazily. 
"“Not at all well,” said Harry firm"
"ly, getting to his feet while con-"
cealing Hedwig behind his back. “So 
I think I’ll need to go to the hos-
pital wing.” 
"“Yes,” said Professor Binns, clea"
rly very much wrong-footed. “Yes 
". . . yes, hospital wing"
" . . . well, off you go"
", then, Perkins . . .” "
Once outside the room Harry retur
ned Hedwig to his shoulder and 
"hurried off up the corridor, pausing to"
 think only when he was out of 
sight of Binns’s door. His first choi
ce of somebody to cure Hedwig 
"would have been Hagrid, of course"
", but as he had no idea where "
"Hagrid was, his only remaining opti"
on was to find Professor Grubbly-
Plank and hope she would help. 
He peered out of a window at the 
"blustery, overcast grounds. There "
was no sign of her anywhere near Ha
grid’s cabin; if she was not teach-
"ing, she was probably in the staffr"
"oom. He set off downstairs, Hedwig "
hooting feebly as she sw
ayed on his shoulder. 
Two stone gargoyles flanked th
e staffroom door. As Harry ap-
"proached, one of them croaked, “You should be in class, sunny Jim.” "
"“This is urgent,” said Harry curtly. "
"“Ooooh, "
"urgent,"
 is it?” said the other ga
rgoyle in a high-pitched 
"voice. “Well, that’s put "
us
" in our place, hasn’t it?” "
Harry knocked; he heard footst
eps and then the door opened and 
he found himself face-to-face
 with Professor McGonagall. 
"“You haven’t been given another detention!” she said at once, her "
square spectacles flashing alarmingly. 
"“No, Professor!” sa"
id Harry hastily. 
 358 "“Well then, why are "
you out of class?” 
“It’s 
"urgent,"
" apparently,” said the second gargoyle snidely. "
“I’m looking for Professor Grub
"bly-Plank,” Harry explained. “It’s "
"my owl, she’s injured.” "
"“Injured owl, did you say?” "
Professor Grubbly-Plank appear
ed at Professor McGonagall’s 
"shoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the "
Daily Prophet.
"“Yes,” said Harry, lifting Hedwig "
"carefully off his shoulder, “she "
turned up after the other post owls 
and her wing’s all 
"funny, look —” "
Professor Grubbly-Plank stuck he
r pipe firmly between her teeth 
and took Hedwig from Harry whil
e Professor McGonagall watched. 
"“Hmm,” said Professor Grubbly-Plan"
"k, her pipe waggling slightly "
as she talked. “Looks like something’
s attacked her. Can’t think what 
"would have done it, though. . . . "
Thestrals will so
metimes go for 
"birds, of course, but Hagrid’s got "
the Hogwarts thestrals well trained 
not to touch owls . . .” 
Harry neither knew nor cared what 
"thestrals were, he just wanted "
to know that Hedwig was going to 
"be all right. Professor McGonagall, "
"however, looked sharply at Harry and said, “Do you know how far "
this owl’s trav
"eled, Potter?” "
"“Er,” said Harry. “From London, I think.” "
He met her eyes briefly and knew
 that she understood “London” to 
"mean “number twelve, Grimmauld Pl"
ace” by the way her eyebrows 
had joined in the middle. 
Professor Grubbly-Plank pulled a mo
nocle out of the inside of her 
robes and screwed it into her eye to 
examine Hedwig’s wing closely. “I 
should be able to sort this out if
" you leave her with me, Potter,” she "
said. “She shouldn’t be flying long di
"stances for a few days, in any case.” "
"“Er — right — thanks,” sa"
"id Harry, just as the "
bell rang for break. 
"“No problem,” said Professor Grub"
"bly-Plank gruffly, turning back "
into the staffroom. 
   359 "“Just a moment, Wilhelmina!” sa"
id Professor McGonagall. “Pot-
ter’s letter!” 
"“Oh yeah!” said Harry, who had "
momentarily forgotten the scroll 
tied to Hedwig’s leg. Pr
ofessor Grubbly-Plank hand
ed it over and then 
disappeared into the staffroom car
"rying Hedwig, who was staring at "
Harry as though unable to believe he
 would give her away like this. 
"Feeling slightly guilty, he turned"
" to go, but Professor McGonagall "
called him back. 
“Potter!” 
"“Yes, Professor?” "
She glanced up and down the corri
dor; there were students coming 
from both directions. 
"“Bear in mind,” she said quickly an"
"d quietly, her eyes on the scroll "
"in his hand, “that channels of comm"
unication in and out of Hogwarts 
"may be being watched, won’t you?” "
"“I —” said Harry, but the flood of"
 students rolling along the corri-
dor was almost upon him. Professo
r McGonagall gave him a curt nod 
"and retreated into the staffroom, leaving Harry to be swept out into "
the courtyard with the crowd. Here
 he spotted Ron and Hermione al-
"ready standing in a sheltered corner, their cloak collars turned up "
against the wind. Harry slit open the 
scroll as he hurried toward them 
and found five words in 
Sirius’s handwriting: 
"Today, same time, same place. "
"“Is Hedwig okay?” asked Hermione anxiously, the moment he was "
within earshot. 
“Where did you take
 her?” asked Ron. 
"“To Grubbly-Plank,” said Harry. "
“And I met McGonagall. . . . 
Listen. . . .” 
And he told them what
 Professor McGonagall
 had said. To his  
 360 "surprise, neither of the others look"
"ed shocked; on the contrary, they "
exchanged significant looks. 
"“What?” said Harry, looking from"
 Ron to Hermione and back 
again. 
"“Well, I was just saying to Ron . . . what if someone had tried to in-"
"tercept Hedwig? I mean, she’s never been hurt on a flight before, has "
she?” 
“Who’s the letter from anyway?” 
"asked Ron, taking the note from "
Harry. 
"“Snuffles,” said "
Harry quietly. 
"“‘Same time, same place’? Does "
he mean the fire in the common 
room?” 
"“Obviously,” said Hermione, also "
reading the note. She looked un-
easy. “I just hope nobody 
else has read 
this. . . .” 
“But it was still sealed and everyt
"hing,” said Harry, trying to con-"
vince himself as much as her. “And nobody would understand what it 
meant if they didn’t know where 
"we’d spoken to him before, would "
they?” 
"“I don’t know,” said Hermione "
"anxiously, hitching her bag back "
over her shoulder as the 
bell rang again. “It wo
uldn’t be exactly diffi-
cult to reseal the scroll by magic.
 . . . And if anyone’s watching the 
Floo Network . . . but I don’t really
 see how we can warn him not to 
come without 
that
 being intercepted too!” 
"They trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for Potions, all "
"three of them lost in thought, bu"
t as they reached the bottom of the 
stairs they were recalled to themse
"lves by the voice of Draco Malfoy, "
who was standing just outside Snap
"e’s classroom door, waving around "
an official-looking piece of parchm
ent and talking much louder than 
was necessary so that they
 could hear every word. 
"“Yeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to "
"continue playing straightaway, I went"
 to ask her first thing this morn-
"ing. Well, it was pretty much automatic, I mean, she knows my father "
   361 "really well, he’s always popping in an"
d out of the Minist
ry. . . . It’ll be 
interesting to see whether Gryffin
"dor are allowed to keep playing, "
wont it?” 
"“Don’t rise,” Hermione whispere"
"d imploringly to Harry and Ron, "
"who were both watching Malfoy, faces set and fists clenched. “It’s "
what he wants. . . .” 
"“I mean,” said Malfoy, raising his voice a little more, his gray eyes "
glittering malevolently in Harry and 
"Ron’s direction, “if it’s a question "
of influence with the Mi
"nistry, I don’t think they’ve got much chance. "
". . . From what my father says, they"
’ve been looking for an excuse to 
sack Arthur Weasley for years. . . 
. And as for Potter . . . My father 
says it’s a matter of time before th
e Ministry has him carted off to St. 
Mungo’s. . . . apparently they’ve go
t a special ward for people whose 
brains have been addl
ed by magic. . . .” 
"Malfoy made a grotesque face, his mouth sagging open and his eyes "
"rolling. Crabbe and Goyle gave their usual grunts of laughter, Pansy "
Parkinson shrieked with glee. 
Something collided hard with 
"Harry’s shoulder, knocking him "
sideways. A split second later he realized that Neville had just charged 
"past him, heading st"
raight for Malfoy. 
"“Neville, "
no
!” 
Harry leapt forward and seized the ba
ck of Neville’s robes; Neville 
"struggled frantically, his fists flailing, trying desperately to get at Mal-"
"foy who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked. "
"“Help me!” Harry flung at Ron, "
managing to get an arm around 
Neville’s neck and drag
"ging him backward, away from the Slytherins. "
Crabbe and Goyle were now flexing 
"their arms, closing in front of "
"Malfoy, ready for the fight. Ron hu"
rried forward and seized Neville’s 
"arms; together, he and Harry succeeded"
 in dragging Neville back into 
the Gryffindor line. Neville’s face 
was scarlet; the pressure Harry was 
exerting on his throat rendered 
"him quite incomprehensible, but odd "
words spluttered from his mouth. 
 362 “Not. . . funny . . . do
n’t . . . Mungo’s . . . show . . . him . . .” 
The dungeon door opened. Snape appe
ared there. His black eyes 
swept up the Gryffindor line to the point where Harry and Ron were 
wrestling with Neville. 
"“Fighting, Potter, Weasley, Long"
"bottom?” Snape said in his cold, "
sneering voice. “Ten points from 
"Gryffindor. Release Longbottom, "
"Potter, or it will be dete"
"ntion. Inside, all of you.” "
Harry let go of Nevi
"lle, who stood panting "
and glaring at him. 
"“I had to stop you,” Harry gasped, "
picking up his bag. “Crabbe and 
Goyle would’ve torn you apart.” 
"Neville said nothing, he merely snatched up his own bag and "
stalked off into the dungeon. 
"“What in the name of Merlin,” sa"
"id Ron slowly, as they followed "
"Neville, “was "
that
 about?” 
Harry did not answer. He knew exac
tly why the subject of people 
who were in St. Mungo’s because of
 magical damage to their brains 
"was highly distressing to Neville,"
 but he had sworn to Dumbledore 
that he would not tell anyone Nevill
e’s secret. Even Neville did not 
know that Harry knew. 
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their "
usual seats at th
e back of the 
"class and pulled out parchment, quills, and their copies of "
One Thou-
sand Magical Herbs and Fungi.
 The class around them was whispering 
"about what Neville had just done, but when Snape closed the dun-"
geon door with an echoing bang 
everybody fell silent immediately. 
"“You will notice,” said Snape in "
"his low, sneering voice, “that we "
have a guest wi
th us today.” 
He gestured toward the dim corner
" of the dungeon, and Harry saw "
"Professor Umbridge sitting there, "
clipboard on her knee. He glanced 
"sideways at Ron and Hermione, his eyebrows raised. Snape and Um-"
"bridge, the two teachers he hated mo"
st . . . it was hard to decide 
which he wanted to tr
iumph over the other. 
   363 “We are continuing with our Stre
"ngthening Solutions today, you "
will find your mixtures as you left 
"them last lesson, if correctly made "
they should have matured well ov
er the weekend — instructions” — 
he waved his wand again — 
“on the board. Carry on.” 
Professor Umbridge spent the first 
half hour of the lesson making 
notes in her corner. Harry was very in
terested in hear
ing her question 
"Snape, so interested, that he was "
becoming careless with his potion 
again. 
"“Salamander blood, Harry!” Hermio"
"ne moaned, grabbing his wrist "
to prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time. “Not 
pomegranate juice!” 
"“Right,” said Harry vaguely, putti"
ng down the bottle and continu-
ing to watch the corner. Umbridge 
"had just gotten to her feet. “Ha,” "
"he said softly, as she strode betwee"
"n two lines of desks toward Snape, "
who was bending over Dean Thomas’s cauldron. 
"“Well, the class seems fairly adva"
"nced for their level,” she said "
briskly to Snape’s back. “Though I would question whether it is ad-
visable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think 
the Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus.” 
Snape straightened up slowly 
and turned to look at her. 
“Now . . . how long have you 
been teaching at Hogwarts?” she 
"asked, her quill poised over her clipboard. "
"“Fourteen years,” Snape replied. "
His expression was unfathomable. 
"His eyes on Snape, Harry added a few"
 drops to his potion; it hissed 
menacingly and turned fr
om turquoise to orange. 
“You applied first for the Defense 
"Against the Dark Arts post, I "
believe?” Professor Um
bridge asked Snape. 
"“Yes,” said Snape quietly. "
“But you were unsuccessful?” 
Snape’s lip curled. 
“Obviously.” 
 364 Professor Umbridge scribb
led on her clipboard. 
“And you have applied regularly 
for the Defense Ag
ainst the Dark 
Arts post since you first jo
"ined the school, I believe?” "
"“Yes,” said Snape quietly, barely "
moving his lips. He looked very 
angry. 
“Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused 
to appoint you?” asked Umbridge. 
"“I suggest you ask him,” said Snape jerkily. "
"“Oh I shall,” said Professor Umbridge with a sweet smile. "
"“I suppose this is relevant?” Snape asked, his black eyes narrowed. "
"“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge. “Yes, the Ministry wants a "
thorough understanding 
of teachers’ — er — 
backgrounds. . . .” 
"She turned away, walked over to"
 Pansy Parkinson and began ques-
tioning her about the le
ssons. Snape looked arou
nd at Harry and their 
"eyes met for a second. Harry hastily dropped his gaze to his potion, "
which was now congealing foully an
d giving off a strong smell of 
burned rubber. 
"“No marks again, then, Potter,” said Snape maliciously, emptying "
Harry’s cauldron with a wave of his wand. “You will write me an essay 
on the correct composition of this
" potion, indicating how and why "
"you went wrong, to be handed in"
" next lesson, do you understand?” "
"“Yes,” said Harry furiously. Snape had already given them home-"
"work, and he had Quidditch practice"
 this evening; this would mean 
another couple of sleepless nights. It
 did not seem possible that he had 
awoken that morning feeling very happy
. All he felt now was a fervent 
desire for this day to en
d as soon as possible. 
"“Maybe I’ll skive off Divination,”"
 he said glumly as they stood 
"again in the courtyard after lunch, the wind whipping at the hems of "
robes and brims of hats. “I’ll pretend to be ill and do Snape’s essay in-
"stead, then I won’t have to st"
ay up half the 
night. . . .” 
"“You can’t skive off Divination,” said Hermione severely. "
   365 "“Hark who’s talking, you walked"
" out of Divination, you hate "
Trelawney!” said Ron indignantly. 
“I don’t 
hate
" her,” said Hermione loftily."
 “I just think she’s an ab-
solutely appalling teacher and a real
 old fraud. . . . But Harry’s already 
missed History of Magic and I don’t 
think he ought to miss anything 
else today!” 
There was too much truth in this to
" ignore, so half an hour later "
"Harry took his seat in the hot, ov"
er-perfumed atmosphere of the Div-
ination classroom feeling angry at 
everybody. Professor Trelawney was 
handing out copies of 
The Dream Oracle
 yet again; he would surely be 
much better employed doing Snape’
s punishment essay than sitting 
here trying to find meaning in a lot of made-up dreams. 
"It seemed, however, that he was no"
t the only person in Divination 
who was in a temper. Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the 
Or-
acle
 down on the table between Ha
"rry and Ron and swept away, her "
lips pursed; she threw the next copy of the 
Oracle
 at Seamus and 
"Dean, narrowly avoiding Seamus’s he"
"ad, and thrust the final one into "
Neville’s chest with such force 
that he slipped off his pouf. 
"“Well, carry on!” said Professo"
"r Trelawney loudly, her voice high "
pitched and somewhat hysterical. “You
 know what to do! Or am I such 
a substandard teacher that you have 
never learned how to open a book?” 
The class stared perplexedly at he
"r and then at each other. Harry, "
"however, thought he knew what"
 was the matter. As Professor 
Trelawney flounced back to the hig
"h-backed teacher’s chair, her mag-"
nified eyes full of angry 
"tears, he leaned his he"
ad closer to Ron’s and 
"muttered, “I think she’"
s got the results of her inspection back.” 
“Professor?” said Parvati Patil in 
a hushed voice (she and Lavender 
had always rather admired Professo
"r Trelawney). “Professor, is there "
anything — er — wrong?” 
“Wrong!” cried Professor Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emo-
tion. “Certainly not! I have been insu
"lted, certainly. . . . Insinuations  "
 366 have been made against me. . . . U
nfounded accusations levelled . . . 
"but no, there is nothing wron"
"g, certainly not. . . .” "
She took a great shuddering breath
" and looked away from Parvati, "
angry tears spilling fr
om under her glasses. 
"“I say nothing,” she choked, “of sixt"
een years’ devoted service. . . . 
"It has passed, apparently, unnoticed."
 . . . But I shall 
"not be insulted, "
"no, I shall not!” "
"“But Professor, who’s insultin"
g you?” asked Parvati timidly. 
“The establishment!” said Professo
"r Trelawney in a deep, dramatic, "
"wavering voice. “Yes, those with ey"
es too clouded by the Mundane to 
"See as I See, to Know as I Know . "
". . Of course, we Seers have always "
"been feared, always pers"
ecuted. . . . It is — al
as — our fate. . . .” 
"She gulped, dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of her shawl, "
"and then pulled a small, embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve, "
into which she blew her nose very ha
rd with a sound like Peeves blow-
ing a raspberry. Ron sniggered. Lavender shot him a disgusted look. 
"“Professor,” said Parvati, “do you me"
an . . . is it something Profes-
sor Umbridge . . . ?” 
“Do not speak to me about th
at woman!” cried Professor 
"Trelawney, leaping to her feet, her "
beads rattling and her spectacles 
flashing. “Kindly continue with your work!” 
And she spent the rest of the lesso
"n striding among them, tears still "
"leaking from behind her glasses, mu"
ttering what sounded like threats 
under her breath. 
“. . . may well choose to leave . . . 
the indignity of it . . . on proba-
tion . . . we shall see . 
. . how she dares . . .” 
“You and Umbridge have got so
mething in commo
"n,” Harry told "
Hermione quietly when they met 
again in Defense Against the Dark 
Arts. “She obviously reckons Trelawney
’s an old fraud too. . . . Looks 
like she’s put her on probation.” 
"Umbridge entered the room as he spoke, wearing her black velvet "
bow and an expression
 of great smugness. 
   367 "“Good afternoon, class.” "
"“Good afternoon, Professor Umbrid"
"ge,” they chanted drearily. "
"“Wands away, please . . .” "
But there was no answering flurry 
of movement this time; nobody 
had bothered to take out their wands. 
“Please turn to page thirty-four of 
Defensive Magical Theory
 and read 
"the third chapter, entitled ‘The Ca"
se for Non-Offensive Responses to 
Magical Attack.’ There will be —” 
"“— no need to talk,” Harry, Ron,"
 and Hermione said together un-
der their breaths. 
"“No Quidditch practice,” said An"
"gelina in hollow tones when Harry, "
"Ron, and Hermione entered the "
common room that night after 
dinner. 
“But I kept my temper!” said Ha
"rry, horrified. “I didn’t say any-"
"thing to her, Angelina, I swear, I —” "
"“I know, I know,” said Angelina miserably. “She just said she "
needed a bit of time to consider.” 
“Consider what?” said Ron angrily.
 “She’s given the Slytherins per-
"mission, why not us?” "
But Harry could imagine how much 
Umbridge was enjoying hold-
ing the threat of no Gryffindor Qu
idditch team over their heads and 
could easily understand why she wo
uld not want to relinquish that 
weapon over them too soon. 
"“Well,” said Hermione, “look on "
the bright side — at least now 
you’ll have time to do Snape’s essay!” 
"“That’s a bright side, is it?” sn"
"apped Harry, while Ron stared in-"
credulously at Hermione. “No Quiddi
tch practice and extra Potions?” 
"Harry slumped down into a chair, dragged his Potions essay reluc-"
"tantly from his bag, and set to work. "
It was very hard to concentrate; 
even though he knew that Sirius 
was not due in the fire until much later he could not help glancing 
 368 into the flames every few minutes ju
st in case. There was also an in-
credible amount of noise in the room: Fred and George appeared fi-
nally to have perfected one type of
" Skiving Snackbox, which they were "
taking turns to demons
trate to a cheering 
and whooping crowd. 
"First, Fred would take a bite out "
"of the orange end of a chew, at "
which he would vomit spectacularly in
to a bucket they
 had placed in 
front of them. Then he would force 
"down the purple end of the chew, "
at which the vomiting would immedi
"ately cease. Lee Jordan, who was "
"assisting the demonstration, was lazi"
ly vanishing the vomit at regular 
intervals with the same Vanishing 
Spell Snape kept using on Harry’s 
potions. 
"What with the regular sounds of retching, cheering, and Fred and "
George taking advance orders from
" the crowd, Harry was finding it "
exceptionally difficult to focus on
 the correct method for Strengthen-
ing Solutions. Hermione was not 
helping matters; the cheers and 
sound of vomit hitting the bottom of
 Fred and George’s bucket were 
punctuated by loud and disapprovin
"g sniffs that Harry found, if any-"
"thing, more distracting. "
"“Just go and stop them, then!” he said irritably, after crossing out "
the wrong weight of powdered gr
iffin claw for the fourth time. 
"“I can’t, they’re not "
technically
" doing anything wrong,” said Her-"
mione through gritted teeth. “They’re
 quite within their rights to eat 
"the foul things themselves, and I can’"
t find a rule that says the other 
"idiots aren’t entitled to buy them, no"
t unless they’re proven to be dan-
"gerous in some way, and it doesn’t look as though they are. . . .” "
"She, Harry, and Ron watched Geor"
ge projectile-vomit into the 
"bucket, gulp down the rest of th"
"e chew, and straighten up, beaming "
with his arms wide to
 protracted applause. 
"“You know, I don’t get why Fred an"
d George only go
t three O.W.L.s 
"each,” said Harry, watching as Fred"
", George, and Lee collected gold "
from the eager crowd. “They real
ly know their stuff. . . .” 
   369 "“Oh, they only know flashy stuff that’s no real use to anyone,” said "
Hermione disparagingly. 
“No real use?” said Ron in a strain
"ed voice. “Hermione, they’ve got "
about twenty-six Galleons already. . . .” 
It was a long while before the crow
"d around the Weasleys dispersed, "
"and then Fred, Lee, and George sat "
up counting their takings even 
"longer, so that it was well past"
" midnight when Harry, Ron, and "
Hermione finally had the common room
 to themselves again. At long 
"last, Fred closed the doorway to "
"the boys’ dormitories behind him, "
rattling his box of Galleons ostentat
iously so that Hermione scowled. 
"Harry, who was making very little progress with his Potions essay, de-"
"cided to give it up for the night. As he put his books away, Ron, who "
"was dozing lightly in an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, "
looked blearily into the 
"fire and said, “Sirius!” "
Harry whipped around; Sirius’s untidy
 dark head was sitting in the 
fire again. 
"“Hi,” he said, grinning. "
"“Hi,” chorused Harry, Ron, and "
"Hermione, all three kneeling "
down upon the hearthrug. Crookshanks purred loudly and ap-
"proached the fire, trying, despite th"
"e heat, to put his face close to "
Sirius’s. 
“How’re things?” said Sirius. 
"“Not that good,” said Harry, as"
 Hermione pulled Crookshanks 
back to stop him singeing his 
whiskers. “The Ministry’s forced 
"through another decree, which means "
we’re not allowed to have Quid-
ditch teams —” 
“— or secret Defense Against the 
Dark Arts groups?” said Sirius. 
There was a short pause. 
“How did you know about that?” Harry demanded. 
"“You want to choose your meeting places more carefully,” said Sir-"
"ius, grinning still more broadly. "
"“The Hog’s Head, I ask you . . .” "
 370 "“Well, it was better than the Th"
ree Broomsticks!” said Hermione 
defensively. “That’s always
 packed with people —” 
“— which means you’d have been ha
"rder to overhear,” said Sirius. "
"“You’ve got a lot to learn, Hermione.” "
“Who overheard us?” Harry demanded. 
"“Mundungus, of course,” said Sirius, and when they all looked "
puzzled he laughed. “He was 
the witch unde
r the veil.” 
“That was Mundungus?” 
"Harry said, stunned. “What was he doing "
in the Hog’s Head?” 
“What do you think he was doing?” said Sirius impatiently. “Keep-
"ing an eye on you, of course.” "
“I’m still being followed?” asked Harry angrily. 
"“Yeah, you are,” said Sirius, “and ju"
"st as well, isn’t it, if the first "
thing you’re going to do on your weekend off is organize an illegal de-
fense group.” 
But he looked neither angry nor 
"worried; on the contrary, he was "
looking at Harry with distinct pride. 
“Why was Dung hiding from us
"?” asked Ron, sounding disap-"
pointed. “We’d’ve li
ked to’ve seen him.” 
"“He was banned from the Hog’s Head twenty years ago,” said Sirius, "
“and that barman’s got 
a long memory. We lost Moody’s spare Invisi-
bility Cloak when Sturgis was arrest
"ed, so Dung’s been dressing as a "
witch a lot lately. . . . Anyway . . . 
"First of all, Ron — I’ve sworn to "
pass on a message from your mother.” 
"“Oh yeah?” said Ron, sounding apprehensive. "
“She says on no account whatsoever 
are you to take part in an ille-
gal secret Defense Against the Dark Ar
ts group. She says you’ll be ex-
pelled for sure and your future will 
be ruined. She says there will be 
plenty of time to learn how to def
end yourself later and that you are 
too young to be worrying about that right now. She also” — Sirius’s 
eyes turned to the other two — “advises Harry and Hermione not to 
"proceed with the group, though she "
accepts that she has no authority 
   371 over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has 
their best interests at heart. She woul
"d have written all this to you, but "
if the owl had been intercepted you’d 
"all have been in real trouble, and "
she can’t say it for herself be
cause she’s on duty tonight.” 
“On duty doing what?” said Ron quickly. 
"“Never you mind, just stuff for the Order,” said Sirius. “So it’s "
fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her I passed it 
"all on, because I don’t think she trusts me to.” "
"There was another pause in which Crookshanks, mewing, at-"
"tempted to paw Sirius’s head, and Ron fiddled with a hole in the "
hearthrug. 
“So you want me to say I’m not go
ing to take part in the defense 
group?” he muttered finally. 
"“Me? Certainly not!” said Sirius, l"
ooking surprised. “I think it’s an 
excellent idea!” 
“You do?” said Harry
", his heart lifting. "
“Of course I do!” said Sirius. “D’you think your father and I 
would’ve lain down and taken orders 
from an old hag like Umbridge?” 
“But — last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take 
risks —” 
“Last year all the evidence was th
at someone inside Hogwarts was 
"trying to kill you, Harr"
y!” said Sirius impatiently. “This year we know 
"that there’s someone outside Hogwarts who’d like to kill us all, so I "
think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea!” 
“And if we do get expelled?” Herm
"ione asked, a quizzical look on "
her face. 
"“Hermione, this whole thing was yo"
"ur idea!” said Harry, staring at "
her. 
“I know it was. . . . I just wonder
"ed what Sirius thought,” she said, "
shrugging. 
"“Well, better expelled and able "
to defend yourselves than sitting 
safely in school withou
"t a clue,” said Sirius. "
 372 "“Hear, hear,” said Harry "
and Ron enthusiastically. 
"“So,” said Sirius, “how are you or"
ganizing this group? Where are 
you meeting?” 
"“Well, that’s a bit of a proble"
"m now,” said Harry. “Dunno where "
we’re going to be able to go. . . .” 
“How about the Shrieking 
Shack?” suggested Sirius. 
"“Hey, that’s an idea!” said Ron excitedly, but Hermione made a "
skeptical noise and all three of them 
"looked at her, Sirius’s head turn-"
ing in the flames. 
"“Well, Sirius, it’s just that there were only four of you meeting in the "
Shrieking Shack when you were at sc
"hool,” said Hermione, “and all of "
you could transform into animals 
and I suppose you could all have 
squeezed under a single Invisibility 
Cloak if you’d wanted to. But there 
"are twenty-eight of us and none of us is an Animagus, so we wouldn’t "
need so much an Invisi
bility Cloak as an In
visibility Marquee —” 
"“Fair point,” said Sirius, looking slig"
htly crestfallen. 
"“Well, I’m sure "
you’ll come up with somewhere. . . . There used to be a pretty roomy 
secret passageway behind that bi
"g mirror on the fourth floor, you "
might have enough space to practice jinxes in there —” 
“Fred and George told me it’s 
"blocked,” said Harry, shaking his "
head. “Caved in or something.” 
"“Oh . . .” said Sirius, frowning. "
"“Well, I’ll have a think and get "
back to —” 
He broke off. His face was sudd
"enly tense, alarmed. He turned "
"sideways, apparently looking into the "
solid brick wall of the fireplace. 
“Sirius?” said Harry anxiously. 
But he had vanished. Harry gaped at
 the flames for 
"a moment, then "
turned to look at Ron and Hermione. 
“Why did he — ?” 
Hermione gave a horrified gasp and 
"leapt to her feet, still staring at "
the fire. 
   373 A hand had appeared amongst the 
"flames, groping as though to "
catch hold of something; a stubby
", short-fingered hand covered in "
ugly old-fashioned rings. . . . 
The three of them ran for it; at
 the door of the boys’ dormitory 
Harry looked back. Umbridge’s ha
nd was still making snatching 
"movements amongst the flames, as "
though she knew exactly where 
Sirius’s hair had been moments befo
re and was determined to seize it. 
Umbridge has been reading your mail, Harry. There’s no other "
explanation.” 
“You think Umbridge attacked 
"Hedwig?” he said, outraged. "
"“I’m almost certain of it,” said "
"Hermione grimly. “Watch your frog, "
it’s escaping.” 
Harry pointed his wand at the bu
llfrog that had been hopping 
hopefully toward the other side of the table — “
Accio
!”— and it 
zoomed gloomily back into his hand. 
Charms was always one of the best
 lessons in which to enjoy a pri-
vate chat: There was generally so 
much movement and activity that 
the danger of being overheard was 
"very slight. Today, with the room "
full of croaking bullfrogs and cawi
"ng ravens, and with a heavy down-"
pour of rain clattering and poundi
"ng against the classroom windows, "
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s whispered discussion about how Um-"
bridge had nearly caught Si
rius went quite unnoticed. 
“I’ve been suspecting this ever si
nce Filch accused you of ordering 
"Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie,” Hermione whis-"
"pered. “I mean, once your letter "
"had been read, it would have been "
U 
   375 quite clear you 
weren’t
" ordering them, so you "
wouldn’t have been in 
trouble at all — it’s a bit of a feebl
"e joke, isn’t it? But then I thought, "
what if somebody just wanted an ex
"cuse to read your mail? Well then, "
it would be a perfect way for Umbrid
"ge to manage it — tip off Filch, "
let him do the dirty work and confisc
"ate the letter, then either find a "
way of stealing it from him or else
 demand to see it — I don’t think 
"Filch would object, when’s he ever "
stuck up for a student’s rights? 
"Harry, you’re squashing your frog.” "
Harry looked down; he was indeed sq
ueezing his bullfrog so tightly 
its eyes were popping; he repl
aced it hastily upon the desk. 
"“It was a very, very close call last"
" night,” said Hermione. “I just "
wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was. 
Silencio
!” 
The bullfrog on which she was practicing her Silencing Charm was 
struck dumb mid-croak and gl
ared at her reproachfully. 
“If she’d caught Snuffles . . .” 
Harry finished the 
sentence for her. 
“He’d probably be back in Azka
ban this morning.” He waved his 
wand without really concentrating; 
his bullfrog swel
led like a green 
balloon and emitted a hi
gh-pitched whistle. 
“
Silencio
"!” said Hermione hastily, po"
inting her wand at Harry’s 
"frog, which deflated silently befo"
"re them. “Well, he mustn’t do it "
"again, that’s all. I just don’t know"
 how we’re going to let him know. We 
can’t send him an owl.” 
“I don’t reckon he’ll risk it agai
"n,” said Ron. “He’s not stupid, he "
knows she nearly got him. 
Silencio
!” 
The large and ugly raven in front 
of him let out a derisive caw. 
“
Silencio
! 
SILENCIO
!” 
The raven cawed more loudly. 
“It’s the way you’re moving your
" wand,” said Hermione, watching "
Ron critically. “You don’t want 
"to wave it, it’s more a sharp "
jab.
” 
“Ravens are harder
" than frogs,” said Ron testily. "
"“Fine, let’s swap,” said Hermione"
", seizing Ron’s raven and replacing "
 376 it with her own fat bullfrog. “
Silencio
!” The raven continued to open 
"and close its sharp beak, "
but no sound came out. 
"“Very good, Miss Granger!” said Pro"
fessor Flitwick’s squeaky little 
"voice and Harry, Ron, and Hermione all jumped. “Now, let me see "
"you try, Mr. Weasley!” "
"“Wha — ? Oh — oh, right,” said Ron, very flustered. “Er — "
Silencio
!” 
He jabbed at the bullfrog so hard that he poked it in the eye; the 
frog gave a deafening croa
k and leapt off the desk. 
It came as no surprise to any 
of them that Harry and Ron were 
given additional practice of th
e Silencing Charm for homework. 
They were allowed to remain in
side over break due to the down-
pour outside. They found seats in
 a noisy and overcrowded classroom 
on the first floor in which Peeves 
was floating dreamily up near the 
"chandelier, occasionally "
blowing an ink pellet at the top of somebody’s 
head. They had barely sat down wh
en Angelina came struggling to-
ward them through the grou
ps of gossiping students. 
“I’ve got permission!” she said. 
“To re-form the Quidditch team!” 
“
Excellent
!” said Ron and Harry together. 
"“Yeah,” said Angelina, beaming. “I went to McGonagall and I "
think
she might have appealed to Dumb
ledore — anyway
", Umbridge had "
to give in. Ha! So I want you dow
n at the pitch at seven o’clock 
"tonight, all right, because we’ve got to make up time, you realize we’re "
only three weeks away from our first match?” 
"She squeezed away from them, na"
rrowly dodged an ink pellet from 
"Peeves, which hit a nearby"
" first year instead, and vanished from sight. "
Ron’s smile slipped slightly as he
" looked out of the window, which "
was now opaque with
 hammering rain. 
“Hope this clears up
 . . . What’s up wi
"th you, Hermione?” "
She too was gazing at 
"the window, but not as "
though she really saw 
it. Her eyes were unfocused and 
there was a frown on her face. 
"“Just thinking . . .” she said, st"
ill frowning at the rain-washed 
window. 
   377 “About Siri . . . Snuf
fles?” said Harry. 
“No . . . not exactly . . .” said Hermione slowly. “More . . . won-
dering . . . I suppose we’re doing the 
right thing . . . I think . . . aren’t 
we? 
Harry and Ron looked at each other. 
"“Well, that clears that"
" up,” said Ron. “It would’ve been really an-"
noying if you hadn’t explained yourself properly.” 
Hermione looked at him as though
 she had only just realized he 
was there. 
"“I was just wondering,” she said, "
"her voice stronger now, “whether "
we’re doing the right t
"hing, starting this Defense Against the Dark "
Arts group.” 
“What!” said Harry and Ron together. 
"“Hermione, it was your idea in the first place!” said Ron "
indignantly. 
"“I know,” said Hermione, twisting her fingers together. “But after "
talking to Snuffles . . .” 
“But he’s all for 
it!” said Harry. 
"“Yes,” said Hermione, staring at "
"the window again. “Yes, that’s "
what made me think ma
ybe it wasn’t a good id
ea after all. . . .” 
Peeves floated over them on his st
"omach, peashooter at the ready; "
automatically all three of them lift
ed their bags to cover their heads 
until he had passed. 
"“Let’s get this straight,” said Harr"
"y angrily, as they put their bags "
"back on the floor, “Sirius agrees with"
" us, so you don’t think we should "
do it anymore?” 
Hermione looked tense and rather
 miserable. Now staring at her 
"own hands she said, “Do you ho"
nestly trust his judgment?” 
"“Yes, I do!” said Harry at once. “He’s always given us great advice!” "
An ink pellet whizzed pa
"st them, striking Kati"
e Bell squarely in 
the ear. Hermione watched Katie le
ap to her feet and start throw-
ing things at Peeves; it was a 
few moments before Hermione spoke 
 378 again and it sounded as though she was choosing her words very 
carefully. 
“You don’t think he has become . . 
. sort of . . . reckless . . . since 
he’s been cooped up in Grimmauld 
Place? You don’t think he’s . . . 
kind of . . . livi
ng through us?” 
"“What d’you mean, ‘living th"
rough us’?” Harry retorted. 
"“I mean . . . well, I think he’d love to be forming secret defense "
societies right under the nose of someone from the Ministry. . . . I 
think he’s really frustrated at how little he can do where he is . . . so 
I think he’s keen to kind
 of . . . egg us on.” 
Ron looked utterly perplexed. 
"“Sirius is right,” he said, “you "
do
 sound just like my mother.” 
Hermione bit her lip and did not 
answer. The bell rang just as 
Peeves swooped down upon Katie an
d emptied an entire ink bottle 
over her head. 
The weather did not improve as the 
"day wore on, so that at seven "
"o’clock that evening, when Harry "
and Ron went down to the Quid-
"ditch pitch for practice, they were soaked through within minutes, "
their feet slipping and sliding on 
"the sodden grass. The sky was a deep, "
thundery gray and it was a relief to gain the warmth and light of the 
"changing rooms, even if they knew"
 the respite was only temporary. 
They found Fred and George debating whether to use one of their 
own Skiving Snackboxes to get out of flying. 
“— but I bet she’d know what we’d 
"done,” Fred said out of the cor-"
ner of his mouth. “If only I hadn’t
 offered to sell her some Puking 
Pastilles yesterday —” 
"“We could try the Fever Fudge,” Ge"
"orge muttered, “no one’s seen "
that yet —” 
"“Does it work?” inquired Ron hopefully, as the hammering of rain "
on the roof intensif
ied and wind howled 
around the building. 
"“Well, yeah,” said Fred, “your "
temperature’ll go right up —” 
   379 "“— but you get these massive pus-filled boils too,” said George, "
“and we haven’t worked out ho
w to get rid of them yet.” 
"“I can’t see any boils,” said Ron, staring at the twins. "
"“No, well, you wouldn’t,” said Fred"
" darkly, “they’re not in a place "
we generally display 
to the public —” 
“— but they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the —” 
"“All right, everyone, listen up,” "
"said Angelina loudly, emerging "
from the Captain’s office. “I know it
"’s not ideal weather, but there’s a "
good chance we’ll be playing Slytherin 
in conditions like this so it’s a 
"good idea to work out how we’re going to cope with them. Harry, "
didn’t you do something to your glas
ses to stop the rain fogging them 
up when we played Huff
lepuff in th
at storm?” 
"“Hermione did it,” said Harry. He"
" pulled out his wand, tapped his "
"glasses and said, “"
Impervius
!” 
"“I think we all ought to try that,” said Angelina. “If we could just "
keep the rain off our faces it would really help visibility — all to-
"gether, come on — "
Impervius
! Okay. Let’s go.” 
They all stowed their wands back 
in the inside pockets of their 
"robes, shouldered their brooms, and followed Angelina out of the "
changing rooms. 
They squelched through the deepeni
ng mud to the middle of the 
pitch; visibility was still very poor even with the Impervius Charm; 
light was fading fast and curtains of
 rain were sweeping the grounds. 
"“All right, on my whistle,” shouted Angelina. "
"Harry kicked off from the ground, "
"spraying mud in all directions, "
"and shot upward, the wind pulling him"
 slightly off course. He had no 
idea how he was going to see the Sn
itch in this weat
her; he was hav-
ing enough difficulty seeing the o
ne Bludger with which they were 
practicing; a minute into the practi
ce it almost unseated him and he 
had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to av
oid it. Unfortunat
ely Angelina did 
"not see this; in fact, she did not a"
ppear to be able to see anything; 
none of them had a clue what the others were doing. The wind was 
 380 picking up; even at a distance Ha
"rry could hear the swishing, pound-"
ing sounds of the rain pummeling the surface of the lake. 
Angelina kept them at it for nea
rly an hour before conceding de-
feat. She led her sodden and disgrunt
led team back in
to the changing 
"rooms, insisting that the practice ha"
"d not been a waste of time, though "
without any real conviction in her 
voice. Fred and George were look-
ing particularly annoyed; both we
re bandy-legged and winced with 
every movement. Harry could hear them complaining in low voices as 
he toweled his hair dry. 
“I think a few of mine have ruptur
"ed,” said Fred in a hollow voice. "
"“Mine haven’t,” said George, wincing. “They’re throbbing like mad "
. . . feel bigger if
 anything . . .” 
“OUCH!” said Harry. 
"He pressed the towel to his face, his eyes screwed tight with pain. "
The scar on his forehead had seared
" again, more painfully than in "
months. 
“What’s up?” said several voices. 
Harry emerged from behind his towel; the changing room was 
blurred because he was not wearing his
 glasses; but he could still tell 
that everyone’s face wa
s turned toward him. 
"“Nothing,” he muttered, “I — poked myself in the eye, that’s "
all. . . .” 
But he gave Ron a significant look and the two of them hung back 
as the rest of the team filed back ou
"tside, muffled in their cloaks, their "
hats pulled low over their ears. 
"“What happened?” said Ron, the moment that Alicia had disap-"
peared through the door. “Was it your scar?” 
Harry nodded. 
"“But . . .” Looking scared, Ron "
strode across to the window and 
"stared out into the rain, “He — he "
"can’t be near us now, can he?” "
"“No,” Harry muttered, sinking onto a bench and rubbing his  "
   381 forehead. “He’s probably miles away. 
It hurt because 
. . . he’s . . . 
angry.” 
Harry had not meant to say that at
" all, and heard the words as "
though a stranger had spoken them — 
yet he knew at once that they 
"were true. He did not know how he knew it, but he did; Voldemort, "
"wherever he was, whatever he was doing, was in a towering temper. "
"“Did you see him?” said Ron, look"
ing horrified. “Did you . . . get a 
"vision, or something?” "
"Harry sat quite still, staring at his"
" feet, allowing his mind and his "
memory to relax in the afte
rmath of the pain. . . . 
"A confused tangle of shapes, a "
howling rush of voices . . . 
"“He wants something done, and it"
"’s not happening fast enough,” "
he said. 
"Again, he felt surprised to hear th"
"e words coming out of his mouth, "
and yet quite certain that they were true. 
“But . . . how do you know?” said Ron. 
Harry shook his head and covered his 
"eyes with his hands, pressing "
down upon them with his palms. Litt
le stars erupted in them. He felt 
Ron sit down on the bench beside 
him and knew Ron was staring at 
him. 
“Is this what it was about last ti
me?” said Ron in a hushed voice. 
“When your scar hurt in Umbrid
ge’s office? You-Know-Who was 
angry?” 
Harry shook his head. 
"“What is it, then?” "
Harry was thinking himself back. 
He had been looking into Um-
bridge’s face. . . . His scar had hurt . . . and he had had that odd feel-
"ing in his stomach . . . a strange, leaping feeling . . . a "
happy
 feeling. 
". . . But, of course, he had not recogn"
"ized it for what it was, as he had "
been feeling so mise
rable himself. . . . 
"“Last time, it was because he was pl"
"eased,” he said. “Really pleased. "
 382 He thought . . . something good wa
s going to happen. And the night 
before we came back to Hogwarts . . .” He thought back to the mo-
ment when his scar had hurt so ba
dly in his and Ron’s bedroom in 
Grimmauld Place. “He 
was furious. . . .” 
"He looked around at Ron,"
 who was gaping at him. 
"“You could take over from Trelawney, mate,” he said in an awed "
voice. 
“I’m not making prophe
"cies,” said Harry. "
"“No, you know what you’re doing?"
"” Ron said, sounding both scared "
"and impressed. “Harry, "
you’re reading You-Know-Who’s mind.
 . . .” 
"“No,” said Harry, shaking his head. "
"“It’s more like . . . his mood, I "
suppose. I’m just getting flashes of
 what mood he’s in. . . . Dumble-
dore said something like this was happe
ning last year. . 
. . He said that 
"when Voldemort was near me, or wh"
"en he was feeling hatred, I could "
"tell. Well, now I’m feeling it wh"
en he’s pleased too. . . .” 
There was a pause. The wind and 
rain lashed at
 the building. 
“You’ve got to tell 
"someone,” said Ron. "
“I told Sirius last time.” 
"“Well, tell him ab"
out this time!” 
"“Can’t, can I?” said Harry grimly. "
“Umbridge is watching the owls 
"and the fires, remember?” "
"“Well then, Dumbledore —” "
"“I’ve just told you, he already kn"
"ows,” said Harry shortly, getting to "
"his feet, taking his cloak off his peg, and swinging it around himself. "
“There’s no point telling him again.” 
Ron did up the fastening of 
"his own cloak, watching Harry "
thoughtfully. 
"“Dumbledore’d want to know,” he said. "
Harry shrugged. 
“C’mon . . . we’ve stil
l got Silencing Charms 
to practice . . .” 
They hurried back through the da
"rk grounds, sliding and stum-"
"bling up the muddy lawns, not ta"
lking. Harry was thinking hard. 
   383 What was it that Voldemort want
ed done that was not happening 
quickly enough? 
“
He’s got other plans . . . plans he can put into operation very quietly 
indeed . . . stuff he can only get by 
stealth . . . like a weapon. Something 
he didn’t have last time.
” 
He had not thought about those wo
rds in weeks; he had been too 
absorbed in what was going on at 
"Hogwarts, too busy dwelling on the "
"ongoing battles with Umbridge, the "
injustice of all the Ministry inter-
ference. . . . But now they came ba
ck to him and made him wonder. 
. . . Voldemort’s anger would make 
sense if he was no nearer laying 
"hands on the weapon, whatever it "
was. . . . Had th
e Order thwarted 
"him, stopped him from seizing it? Wh"
ere was it kept? Who had it now? 
“
"Mimbulus mimbletonia,"
”
said Ron’s voice and Harry came back to 
his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the 
common room. 
It appeared that Hermione had go
"ne to bed early, leaving Crook-"
"shanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly, knitted "
elf hats lying on a table by the fire
. Harry was rather grateful that she 
was not around because he did not 
much want to discuss his scar 
hurting and have her urge him to 
go to Dumbledore too. Ron kept 
"throwing him anxious glances, but "
Harry pulled out his Potions book 
"and set to work to finish his essay,"
 though he was only pretending to 
"concentrate and, by the time that Ron said he was going to bed too, "
had written hardly anything. 
Midnight came and went while 
Harry was reading and rereading a 
passage about the uses of scurvy-gra
"ss, lovage, and sneezewort and not "
taking in a word of it. . . . 
These plantes are moste efficacious in
" the inflaming of the braine, and "
are therefore much used 
in Confusing and Befudd
"lement Draughts, where "
the wizard is desirous of produc
ing hot-headedness and recklessness.
 . . . 
. . . 
Hermione said Sirius was becoming reckless cooped up in 
Grimmauld Place. . . . 
 384 . . . 
moste efficacious in the inflaming 
"of the braine, and are therefore "
much used 
. . . 
. . .
the 
Daily Prophet 
would think his brain was inflamed if they 
found out that he knew what
 Voldemort was feeling . . . 
. . . 
therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts
 . . . 
. . .
"confusing was the word, all right; "
why 
did he know what Volde-
mort was feeling? What was t
"his weird connection between them, "
which Dumbledore had never been 
able to explain satisfactorily? 
. . . 
where the wizard is desirous
 . . . 
. . . 
how he would like to sleep . . . 
. . . 
of producing hot-headedness
 . . . 
". . . It was warm and comfortable in his armchair before the fire, "
with the rain still beating heav
ily on the windowpanes and Crook-
shanks purring and the crac
kling of the flames. . . . 
The book slipped from 
Harry’s slack grip and 
landed with a dull 
thud on the hearthrug. His 
head fell sideways. . . . 
"He was walking once more along a windowless corridor, his foot-"
steps echoing in the silence. As 
the door at the end of the passage 
loomed larger his heart beat fast with excitement. . . . If he could only 
open it . . . enter beyond . . . 
He stretched out his hand. . . . His fi
ngertips were inches from it. . . . 
"“Harry Potter, sir!” "
He awoke with a start. The candles 
had all been extinguished in the 
"common room, but there was something moving close by. "
"“Whozair?” said Harry, sitting uprigh"
t in his chair. The fire was al-
"most extinguished, the room very dark. "
"“Dobby has your owl, sir!” said a squeaky voice. "
"“Dobby?” said Harry thickly, pe"
ering through the gloom toward 
the source of the voice. 
Dobby the house-elf was standing
 beside the table on which 
"Hermione had left her half a dozen knitted hats. His large, pointed "
ears were now sticking out from benea
th what looked like all the hats 
   385 that Hermione had ever 
knitted; he was wearing one on top of the 
"other, so that his head seemed el"
"ongated by two or three feet, and on "
the very topmost bobble sat Hedw
"ig, hooting serenely and obviously "
cured. 
“Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potter’s owl!” said the elf 
"squeakily, with a look of positive"
 adoration on his face. “Professor 
Grubbly-Plank says she is
" all well now, sir!” "
He sank into a deep bow so that
 his pencil-like nose brushed the 
threadbare surface of the hearthrug and Hedwig gave an indignant 
hoot and fluttered onto th
e arm of Harry’s chair. 
"“Thanks, Dobby!” said Harry, stroki"
ng Hedwig’s head and blinking 
"hard, trying to rid himself of the im"
age of the door in his dream. . . . 
It had been very vivid. . . . Looking 
"back at Dobby, he noticed that the "
elf was also wearing several scarves 
"and innumerable socks, so that his "
feet looked far too big for his body. 
“Er . . . have you been taking 
all
 the clothes Hermione’s been leav-
ing out?” 
"“Oh no, sir,” said Dobby happily, "
“Dobby has been taking some for 
"Winky too, sir.” "
"“Yeah, how is Winky?” asked Harry. "
Dobby’s ears drooped slightly. 
"“Winky is still drinking lots, sir,” he said sadly, his enormous round "
"green eyes, large as tennis balls, downc"
ast. “She still does not care for 
"clothes, Harry Potter. Nor do the ot"
her house-elves. None of them 
"will clean Gryffindor Tower anymore, not with the hats and socks hid-"
"den everywhere, they finds them in"
"sulting, sir. Dobby does it all him-"
"self, sir, but Dobby does not mind, sir, for he always hopes to meet "
"Harry Potter and tonight, sir, he ha"
s got his wish!” Dobby sank into a 
deep bow again. “But Harry Pott
"er does not seem happy,” Dobby "
"went on, straightening up agai"
n and looking timidly at Harry. 
“Dobby heard him muttering in his
 sleep. Was Harry Potter having 
bad dreams?” 
 386 "“Not really bad,” said Harry, ya"
wning and rubbing his eyes. “I’ve 
had worse.” 
"The elf surveyed Harry out of his vast, orblike eyes. Then he said "
"very seriously, his ears drooping, “D"
obby wishes he could help Harry 
"Potter, for Harry Potter set Dobby"
" free and Dobby is much, much "
happier now. . . .” 
Harry smiled. 
"“You can’t help me, Dobby, bu"
t thanks for th
e offer. . . .” 
He bent and picked up his Potion
s book. He’d have to try and fin-
ish the essay tomorrow. He closed the book and as he did so the fire-
light illuminated the thin white scar
s on the back of his hand — the 
result of his detention with Umbridge. 
“Wait a moment — there 
is
" something you can do for me, Dobby,” "
said Harry slowly. 
"The elf looked around, beaming. "
"“Name it, Harry Potter, sir!” "
“I need to find a place where twen
ty-eight people can practice De-
fense Against the Dark Arts without being discovered by any of the 
"teachers. Especially,” Harry clenched"
" his hand on the book, so that "
"the scars shone pearly white, “Professor Umbridge.” "
He expected the elf’s smile to vani
"sh, his ears to droop; he expected "
"him to say that this was impossible, "
"or else that he would try, but his "
hopes were not high. . . . What he 
had not expected was for Dobby to 
"give a little skip, his ears waggling happily, and clap his hands together. "
"“Dobby knows the perfect place, sir!” he said happily. “Dobby "
heard tell of it from the other hous
"e-elves when he came to Hogwarts, "
sir. It is known by us as the Come
" and Go Room, sir, or else as the "
Room of Requirement!” 
“Why?” said Harry curiously. 
“Because it is a room that a pers
"on can only enter,” said Dobby se-"
"riously, “when they have real need "
"of it. Sometimes it is there, and "
"sometimes it is not, but when it appe"
"ars, it is always equipped for the "
   387 "seeker’s needs. Dobby has used it, sir,"
"” said the elf, dropping his voice "
"and looking guilty, “when Winky has "
been very drunk. He has hidden 
her in the Room of Requirement 
and he has found antidotes to 
"butterbeer there, and a nice elf-si"
zed bed to settle her on while she 
"sleeps it off, sir. . . . And Dobb"
y knows Mr. Filch has found extra 
cleaning materials there when he
" has run short, sir, and —” "
"“— and if you really needed a bathroom,” said Harry, suddenly re-"
membering something Dumbledore had 
said at the Yule Ball the pre-
"vious Christmas, “would it fill"
 itself with chamber pots?” 
"“Dobby expects so, sir,” said Do"
"bby, nodding earnestly. “It is a "
"most amazing room, sir.” "
“How many people know about it?” 
"said Harry, sitting up straighter "
in his chair. 
"“Very few, sir. Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it, "
"sir, but often they never finds it agai"
"n, for they do not know that it is "
always there waiting to be 
"called into service, sir.” "
"“It sounds brilliant,” said Harry, "
his heart racing. “It sounds per-
"fect, Dobby. When can you "
show me where it is?” 
"“Anytime, Harry Potter, sir,” said Dobby, looking delighted at "
Harry’s enthusiasm. “We coul
"d go now, if you like!” "
For a moment Harry was tempted to go now; he was halfway out 
"of his seat, intending to hurry upstai"
"rs for his Invisibility Cloak when, "
"not for the first time, a voice very mu"
ch like Hermione’s whispered in 
his ear: 
reckless.
" It was, after all, very la"
"te, he was exhausted and had "
Snape’s essay to finish. 
"“Not tonight, Dobby,” said Harry re"
"luctantly, sinking back into his "
chair. “This is really important. . . 
". I don’t want to blow it, it’ll need "
"proper planning. . . . Listen, can yo"
u just tell me exactly where this 
Room of Requirement is an
d how to get in there?” 
Their robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across 
the flooded vegetable patch to doubl
"e Herbology, where they could "
 388 hardly hear what Profe
ssor Sprout was saying 
over the hammering of 
raindrops hard as hailstones on 
the greenhouse roof. The afternoon’s 
Care of Magical Creatures lesson was to be relocated from the storm-
"swept grounds to a free classroom on the ground floor and, to their "
"intense relief, Angelina sought out he"
r team at lunch to tell them that 
Quidditch practice
 was canceled. 
"“Good,” said Harry quietly, when "
"she told him, “because we’ve "
found somewhere to have our first 
"Defense meeting. Tonight, eight "
"o’clock, seventh floor opposite th"
at tapestry of Ba
rnabas the Barmy 
being clubbed by thos
e trolls. Can you tell Katie and Alicia?” 
She looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others; 
Harry returned hungrily
 to his sausages and mash. When he looked 
up to take a drink of pumpkin 
"juice, he found Hermione watching "
him. 
“What?” he said thickly. 
“Well . . . it’s just th
at Dobby’s plans aren’t always that safe. Don’t 
you remember when he lost yo
u all the bones in your arm?” 
“This room isn’t just some ma
d idea of Dobby’s; Dumbledore 
"knows about it too, he mentioned "
it to me at the Yule Ball.” 
Hermione’s expression cleared. 
“Dumbledore told you about it?” 
"“Just in passing,” said Harry, shrugging. "
"“Oh well, that’s all right then,” said Hermione briskly and she "
raised no more objections. 
Together with Ron they had spen
t most of the day seeking out 
those people who had signed their na
mes to the list in the Hog’s Head 
and telling them where to meet th
at evening. Somewhat to Harry’s 
"disappointment, it was Ginny who "
managed to find Cho Chang and 
"her friend first; however, by the "
end of dinner he was confident that 
the news had been passed to every 
one of the twenty-five people who 
had turned up in the Hog’s Head. 
"At half-past seven Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the Gryffindor "
   389 "common room, Harry clutching a certai"
n piece of aged parchment in 
his hand. Fifth years were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine 
"o’clock, but all three of them kept"
 looking around nervously as they 
made their way up to
 the seventh floor. 
"“Hold it,” said Harry warningly, "
unfolding the piece of parchment 
"at the top of the last staircase, "
"tapping it with his wand, and mutter-"
"ing, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” "
A map of Hogwarts appeared upon the blank surface of the parch-
"ment. Tiny black moving dots, la"
"beled with names, showed where "
various people were. 
"“Filch is on the second floor,” sa"
"id Harry, holding the map close to "
"his eyes and scanning it closely, "
“and Mrs. Norris is on the fourth.” 
“And Umbridge?” said Hermione anxiously. 
"“In her office,” said Harry, pointing. “Okay, let’s go.” "
They hurried along the corridor to
 the place Dobby had described 
"to Harry, a stretch of blank wall "
opposite an enormous tapestry de-
picting Barnabas the Barmy’s foolish attempt to train trolls for the 
ballet. 
"“Okay,” said Harry quietly, while "
a moth-eaten troll paused in his 
relentless clubbing of the would-be ballet teacher to watch. “Dobby 
said to walk past this bit of wall
" three times, conc"
entrating hard on 
what we need.” 
"They did so, turning sharply at th"
e window just beyond the blank 
"stretch of wall, then at the man-size"
 vase on its other side. Ron had 
screwed up his eyes in concentr
"ation, Hermione was whispering "
"something under her breath, Harry’s "
fists were clenched as he stared 
ahead of him. 
We need somewhere to learn to fight. 
. . . he thought. 
Just give us a 
place to practice 
. . .
 somewhere they can’t find us
 . . . 
"“Harry,” said Hermione sharply, as they wheeled around after their "
third walk past. 
A highly polished door 
had appeared in the 
wall. Ron was staring 
 390 "at it, looking slightly wary. Harry re"
"ached out, seized the brass handle, "
"pulled open the door, and led the way into a spacious room lit with "
flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors 
below. 
The walls were lined with wooden b
"ookcases, and inst"
ead of chairs 
there were large silk cushions on th
e floor. A set of shelves at the far 
end of the room carried a range of 
"instruments such as Sneakoscopes, "
"Secrecy Sensors, and a large, crac"
ked Foe-Glass that Harry was sure 
"had hung, the previous year, "
in the fake Moody’s office. 
“These will be good when we’re pr
"acticing Stunning,” said Ron "
"enthusiastically, prodding one of"
 the cushions with his foot. 
“And just look at these books!” sa
"id Hermione excitedly, running a "
finger along the spines of the large leather-bound tomes. “
A Com-
pendium of Common Curses and Their Counter-Actions
 . . . 
The Dark 
Arts Outsmarted
 . . . 
Self-Defensive Spellwork
 . . . wow . . .” She looked 
"around at Harry, her face glowing, "
and he saw that the presence of 
hundreds of books had finally co
nvinced Hermione that what they 
"were doing was right. “Harry, this is"
" wonderful, there’s everything we "
need here!” 
And without furthe
r ado she slid 
Jinxes for the Jinxed
" from its shelf, "
sank onto the nearest cus
"hion, and began to read. "
There was a gentle knock on 
the door. Harry looked around; 
"Ginny, Neville, Lavender, Parv"
"ati, and Dean had arrived. "
"“Whoa,” said Dean, staring around, impressed. “What is this "
place?” 
"Harry began to explain, but before"
 he had finished more people 
"had arrived, and he had "
to start all over again. By the time eight 
"o’clock arrived, every cushion wa"
s occupied. Harry moved across to 
the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a 
"satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at him. "
Hermione carefully marked her page of 
Jinxes for the Jinxed
 and set the 
book aside. 
   391 "“Well,” said Harry, slightly nerv"
ously. “This is the place we’ve 
"found for practices, and you’ve — "
er — obviously found it okay —” 
"“It’s fantastic!” said Cho, and "
several people murmured their 
agreement. 
"“It’s bizarre,” said Fred, frowning "
around at it. “We once hid from 
"Filch in here, remember, George? But it was just a broom cupboard "
then. . . .” 
"“Hey, Harry, what’s this stuff?” asked Dean from the rear of the "
"room, indicating the Sneako"
scopes and the Foe-Glass. 
"“Dark Detectors,” said Harry, st"
epping between the cushions to 
reach them. “Basically 
they all show when Dark wizards or enemies 
"are around, but you don’t want to re"
"ly on them too much, they can be "
fooled. . . .” 
He gazed for a moment into the 
cracked Foe-Glass; shadowy fig-
ures were moving around inside it
", though none was recognizable. He "
turned his back on it. 
"“Well, I’ve been thinking about the "
sort of stuff we ought to do first 
"and — er —” He noticed a raised hand. “What, Hermione?” "
"“I think we ought to elect a leader,” said Hermione. "
"“Harry’s leader,” said Cho at once"
", looking at Hermione as though "
"she were mad, and Ha"
rry’s stomach did yet 
another back flip. 
"“Yes, but I think we ought to vote "
"on it properly,” said Hermione, "
unperturbed. “It makes it formal and it gives him authority. So — 
everyone who thinks Harry 
ought to be our leader?” 
"Everybody put up their hands, ev"
"en Zacharias Smith, though he "
did it very halfheartedly. 
"“Er — right, thanks,” said Harry, "
who could feel his face burning. 
“And — 
"what,"
 Hermione?” 
“I also think we ought to have a 
"name,” she said brightly, her hand "
"still in the air. “It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, "
don’t you think?” 
“Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League?” said Angelina hopefully. 
 392 “Or the Ministry of Magic Are Morons Group?” suggested Fred. 
"“I was thinking,” said Hermione, frowning at Fred, “more of a "
name that didn’t tell everyone what we
" were up to, so we can refer to "
it safely outside meetings.” 
"“The Defense Association?” said Cho. “The D.A. for short, so no-"
body knows what we’re talking about?” 
"“Yeah, the D.A.’s good,”"
 said Ginny. “Only let’s make it stand for 
Dumbledore’s Army because that’s the 
"Ministry’s worst fear, isn’t it?” "
There was a good deal of apprecia
tive murmuring and laughter at 
this. 
“All in favor of the D.A.?” said 
"Hermione bossily, kneeling up on "
her cushion to count. “That’s a majority — motion passed!” 
She pinned the piece of paper with 
all of their names on it on the 
wall and wrote DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY across the top in large 
letters. 
"“Right,” said Harry, when she ha"
"d sat down again, “shall we get "
"practicing then? I was thinking, "
the first thing we should do is 
Expel-
"liarmus,"
" you know, the Disarming Charm. I know it’s pretty basic but "
I’ve found it really useful —” 
“Oh 
"please,"
"” said Zacharias Smith, roll"
ing his eyes and folding his 
arms. “I don’t think 
Expelliarmus
 is exactly going to help us against 
"You-Know-Who, do you?” "
"“I’ve used it against him,” said Ha"
rry quietly. “It saved my life last 
June.” 
Smith opened his mouth stupidly. 
The rest of the room was very 
quiet. 
“But if you think it’s beneath 
"you, you can leave,” Harry said. "
Smith did not move. Nor did anybody else. 
"“Okay,” said Harry, his mouth slig"
htly drier than usual with all 
"those eyes upon him, “I reckon we should all divide into pairs and "
practice.” 
"It felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as "
   393 seeing them followed. Everybody got 
to their feet at once and divided 
"up. Predictably, Neville "
was left partnerless. 
"“You can practice with me,” Ha"
rry told him. “Right — on the 
"count of three, then "
"— one, two, three —” "
The room was suddenly full of shouts of “
Expelliarmus
!”: Wands 
"flew in all directions, missed spells "
hit books on shelve
s and sent them 
flying into the air. Ha
rry was too quick for Nevi
"lle, whose wand went "
spinning out of his hand
", hit the ceiling in a "
"shower of sparks, and "
landed with a clatter on top of 
"a bookshelf, from which Harry re-"
trieved it with a Summoning Charm.
 Glancing around he thought he 
had been right to suggest that they 
practice the basics first; there was 
a lot of shoddy spellwork going on
; many people were not succeeding 
"in disarming their opponents at all, "
but merely causing them to jump 
backward a few paces or wince as
 the feeble spell whooshed over 
them. 
“
Expelliarmus
"!” said Neville, and Harry,"
" caught unawares, felt his "
wand fly out of his hand. 
“I DID IT!” said Neville gleefully
. “I’ve never done it before — I 
DID IT!” 
“Good one!” said Harry encouraging
"ly, deciding not to point out "
that in a real duel situation Nevill
e’s opponent was unli
kely to be star-
ing in the opposite direction with 
his wand held loosely at his side. 
"“Listen, Neville, can you take it "
in turns to practice with Ron and 
Hermione for a couple of minutes 
so I can walk around and see how 
the rest are doing?” 
Harry moved off into the middle of
 the room. Something very odd 
was happening to Zacharias Smith; 
every time he opened his mouth 
"to disarm Anthony Goldstein, hi"
s own wand would fly out of his 
"hand, yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not "
have to look far for the solution 
"of the mystery, however; Fred and "
George were several feet from Smit
h and taking it in turns to point 
their wands at his back. 
 394 "“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. "
“Couldn’t resist . . .” 
"Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who "
were doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; 
"she was doing very well, whereas Mich"
ael was either very bad or un-
willing to jinx her. Ernie Macmil
lan was flourishing his wand unnec-
"essarily, giving his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey "
brothers were enthusiastic but erra
tic and mainly responsible for all 
the books leaping off the shelves 
around them. Luna Lovegood was 
"similarly patchy, occasionally send"
ing Justin Finch-Fletchley’s wand 
"spinning out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to "
stand on end. 
"“Okay, stop!” Ha"
rry shouted. “
Stop
! 
STOP
!” 
"I need a whistle,"
" he thought, and immediat"
ely spotted one lying on 
top of the nearest row of books. He caught it up and blew hard. Every-
one lowered their wands. 
"“That wasn’t bad,” said Harry, “but"
 there’s definite room for im-
provement.” Zacharias Smith glared at
 him. “Let’s tr
y again. . . .” 
He moved off around the room agai
"n, stopping here and there to "
make suggestions. Slowly the ge
neral performance improved. He 
avoided going near Cho and her fri
"end for a while, but after walking "
twice around every other pair in the room felt he could not ignore 
them any longer. 
"“Oh no,” said Cho rather wildly as he approached. “"
Expelliarmious
! 
"I mean, "
Expellimellius
"! I — oh, sorry, Marietta!” "
Her curly-haired friend’s sleeve had caught fire; Marietta extin-
guished it with her own wand and gl
ared at Harry as though it was his 
fault. 
"“You made me nervous, I was doing all right before then!” Cho told "
Harry ruefully. 
"“That was quite good,” Harry lied, "
but when she raised her eye- 
   395 "brows he said, “Well, no, it was lousy, but I know you can do it prop-"
"erly, I was watching from over there. . . .” "
She laughed. Her friend Marietta looked at them rather sourly and 
turned away. 
"“Don’t mind her,” Cho muttered. “S"
he doesn’t really want to be 
here but I made her come with me. 
Her parents have forbidden her to 
"do anything that might upset Umbridge, you see — her mum works "
for the Ministry.” 
“What about your parents?” asked Harry. 
"“Well, they’ve forbidden me to ge"
t on the wrong side of Umbridge 
"too,” said Cho, drawing herself up pr"
oudly. “But if they think I’m not 
going to fight You-Know-Who afte
r what happened to Cedric —” 
"She broke off, looking rather confu"
"sed, and an awkward silence fell "
between them; Terry Boot’s wand went
 whizzing past Harry’s ear and 
hit Alicia Spinnet hard on the nose. 
"“Well, my father is "
very
 supportive of any anti-Ministry action!” 
said Luna Lovegood proudly from 
just behind Harry; evidently she 
had been eavesdropping on his co
nversation while Justin Finch-
Fletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had 
flown up over his head. “He’s always
 saying he’d believe anything of 
"Fudge, I mean, the number of go"
blins Fudge has had assassinated! 
And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible 
"poisons, which he feeds secretly to"
 anybody who disa
grees with him. 
And then there’s his Umgubular Slashkilter —” 
"“Don’t ask,” Harry muttered to Cho as she opened her mouth, "
looking puzzled. She giggled. 
"“Hey, Harry,” Hermione called from the other end of the room, "
“have you checked the time?” 
He looked down at his watch and 
received a shock — it was al-
"ready ten past nine, which meant th"
ey needed to get back to their 
common rooms immediately or risk 
being caught and punished by  
 396 Filch for being out-of-bounds. He blew his whistle; everybody 
"stopped shouting, “"
Expelliarmus
!” and the last couple of wands clat-
tered to the floor. 
"“Well, that was pretty good,” said"
" Harry, “but we’ve overrun, we’d "
better leave it here. Same ti
"me, same place next week?” "
“Sooner!” said Dean Thomas eage
rly and many people nodded in 
agreement. 
"Angelina, however, said quickly, "
“The Quidditch season’s about to 
"start, we need te"
am practices too!” 
"“Let’s say next Wednesday night,"
" then,” said Harry, “and we can "
decide on additional meetings then
". . . . Come on, we’d better get "
going. . . .” 
He pulled out the Marauder’s Map 
again and checked it carefully 
for signs of teachers on the seventh floor. He let them all leave in 
"threes and fours, watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they re-"
turned safely to their dormitories
: the Hufflepuffs to the basement 
corridor that also led to the kitchens
", the Ravenclaws to a tower on the "
"west side of the castle, and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the "
seventh floor and the 
Fat Lady’s portrait. 
"“That was really, really good, Ha"
"rry,” said Hermione, when finally "
"it was just her, Harry, and Ron left. "
"“Yeah, it was!” said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the "
door and watched it melt back into 
stone behind them. “Did you see 
"me disarm Hermione, Harry?” "
"“Only once,” said Hermione, stun"
g. “I got you loads more than 
you got me —” 
"“I did not only get you once, I got you at least three times —” "
"“Well, if you’re counting the o"
ne where you tripped over your own 
feet and knocked the wand
 out of my hand —” 
They argued all the way back 
"to the common room, but Harry was "
not listening to them. He had one ey
"e on the Marauder’s Map, but he "
was also thinking of how Cho had 
said he made her nervous. . . . 
Harry felt as though he were car
rying some kind of talisman 
inside his chest over the foll
"owing two weeks, a glowing se-"
cret that supported him through Um
bridge’s classes and even made it 
possible for him to smile blandly 
as he looked into her horrible 
bulging eyes. He and the D.A. were 
"resisting her under her very nose, "
doing the very thing that she and th
"e Ministry most feared, and when-"
ever he was supposed to be reading Wilbert Slinkhard’s book during 
her lessons he dwelled instead on sati
sfying memories of their most re-
"cent meetings, remembering how Ne"
ville had successfully disarmed 
"Hermione, how Colin Creevey had ma"
stered the Impediment Jinx af-
"ter three meetings’ hard effort, how "
Parvati Patil had produced such a 
good Reductor Curse that she had re
duced the table carrying all the 
Sneakoscopes to dust. 
He was finding it almost impossible to fix a regular night of the 
"week for D.A. meetings, as they had to accommodate three separate "
"Quidditch teams’ practices, which were often rearranged depending on "
the weather conditions; but Harry wa
"s not sorry about this, he had a "
feeling that it was probably better to
 keep the timing of their meetings 
H 
 398 unpredictable. If anyone was watching
" them, it would be hard to make "
out a pattern. 
Hermione soon devised a very cl
ever method of communicating 
the time and date of the next meetin
g to all the members in case they 
needed to change it at short notice
", because it would look so suspi-"
cious if people from different Hous
es were seen crossing the Great 
Hall to talk to each other too oft
en. She gave each of the members of 
the D.A. a fake Galleon (Ron became very excited when he saw the 
"basket at first, convinced that she was actually giving out gold). "
“You see the numerals around th
e edge of the coins?” Hermione 
"said, holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meet-"
ing. The coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches. 
“On real Galleons that’s just a seri
al number referring to the goblin 
who cast the coin. On these fake 
"coins, though, the numbers will "
change to reflect the time and date 
of the next meeting. The coins will 
"grow hot when the date changes, so if"
 you’re carrying them in a pocket 
you’ll be able to feel them. We ta
"ke one each, and when Harry sets the "
date of the next meeting he
’ll change the numbers on 
his
" coin, and be-"
"cause I’ve put a Protean Charm on them, they’ll all change to mimic "
his.” 
A blank silence greeted 
Hermione’s words. She looked around at all 
"the faces upturned to her, rather disconcerted. "
“Well — I thought it was a good id
"ea,” she said un"
"certainly, “I "
"mean, even if Umbridge asked us "
"to turn out our pockets, there’s "
"nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon,"
" is there? But . . . well, if you "
don’t want to us
e them . . .” 
“You can do a Protean Ch
arm?” said Terry Boot. 
"“Yes,” said Hermione. "
“But that’s . . . that’s
" N.E.W.T. standard, that is,” he said weakly. "
"“Oh,” said Hermione, trying to look"
" modest. “Oh . . . well . . . yes, "
I suppose it is. . . .” 
   399 "“How come you’re not in Ravenclaw?” he demanded, staring at "
Hermione with somethin
g close to wonder. “Wit
h brains like yours?” 
"“Well, the Sorting Hat did seriousl"
y consider putting me in Raven-
"claw during my Sorting,” said Hermione brightly, “but it decided on "
Gryffindor in the end. So does th
at mean we’re using the Galleons?” 
There was a murmur of assent and everybody moved forward to 
collect one from the basket. Harr
y looked sideways at Hermione. 
“You know what these remind me of?” 
"“No, what’s that?” "
"“The Death Eaters’ scars. Voldemort touches one of them, and all "
"their scars burn, and they know"
 they’ve got to join him.” 
"“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione quietly. “That "
is 
where I got the idea 
. . . but you’ll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal 
rather than on our me
mbers’ skin. . . .” 
"“Yeah . . . I prefer your way,” said Harry, grinning, as he slipped his "
Galleon into his pocket. “I suppose th
e only danger with these is that 
we might accidental
ly spend them.” 
"“Fat chance,” said Ron, who wa"
s examining his own fake Galleon 
with a slightly mournful air. “I ha
ven’t got any real Galleons to con-
fuse it with.” 
"As the first Quidditch match of the season, Gryffindor versus "
"Slytherin, drew nearer, their D.A. m"
eetings were put on hold because 
Angelina insisted on almost daily 
practices. The fact that the Quid-
ditch Cup had not been held for so 
long added considerably to the in-
terest and excitement surroundi
ng the forthcoming game. The 
Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taki
ng a lively interest in the out-
"come, for they, of course, would be playing both teams over the com-"
ing year; and the Heads of House 
"of the competing teams, though "
they attempted to disguise it un
der a decent pretense of sportsman-
"ship, were determined to see their "
side’s victory. Harry realized how 
much Professor McGonagall cared ab
out beating Slytherin when she  
 400 abstained from giving th
em homework in the week leading up to the 
match. 
"“I think you’ve got enough to be getting on with at the moment,” "
she said loftily. Nobody could quite 
believe their ears until she looked 
directly at Harry and Ron and said 
"grimly, “I’ve become accustomed "
to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my
" study, boys, and I really don’t "
"want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to "
"practice, won’t you?” "
Snape was no less obviously part
isan: He had booked the Quid-
ditch pitch for Slytherin practice 
so often that the Gryffindors had 
difficulty getting on it to play. He 
was also turning a deaf ear to the 
many reports of Slytherin attempts 
to hex Gryffindor players in the 
corridors. When Alicia Spinnet turned
 up in the hospital wing with 
her eyebrows growing so thick and fa
st that they obscured her vision 
"and obstructed her mouth, Snape in"
sisted that she must have at-
tempted a Hair-Thickening Charm on 
herself and refused to listen to 
the fourteen eyewitnesses who insi
sted that they
 had seen the 
"Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, "
hit her from behind with a jinx 
while she worked 
in the library. 
Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindor’s
" chances; they had, after all, "
never lost to Malfoy’s team. Admi
ttedly Ron was still not performing 
"to Wood’s standard, but he was work"
ing extremely hard to improve. 
His greatest weakness was a tend
ency to lose confidence when he 
made a blunder; if he let in one 
goal he became flustered and was 
therefore likely to miss more. On 
"the other hand, Harry had seen Ron "
make some truly spectacular saves 
when he was on form: During one 
"memorable practice, he had hung "
one-handed from his broom and 
kicked the Quaffle so hard away from
 the goal hoop that it soared the 
length of the pitch and through the 
center hoop at the other end. The 
rest of the team felt this save compared favorably with one made re-
"cently by Barry Ryan, the Irish Inte"
"rnational Keeper, against Poland’s "
"top Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski. Ev"
en Fred had said that Ron might 
   401 "yet make him and George proud, and that they were seriously consid-"
ering admitting that he was relate
"d to them, something he assured "
Ron they had been trying to deny for four years. 
The only thing really worrying Harry was how much Ron was al-
lowing the tactics of the Slytherin te
am to upset him b
efore they even 
"got onto the pitch. Harry, of co"
"urse, had endured their snide com-"
"ments for more than four years, so"
" whispers of, “Hey, Potty, I heard "
"Warrington’s sworn to knock you off your broom on Saturday,” far "
"from chilling his blood, made him "
laugh. “Warrington’s aim’s so pa-
"thetic I’d be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me,” "
"he retorted, which made Ron and Hermione laugh and wiped the "
smirk off Pansy Parkinson’s face. 
But Ron had never endured 
a relentless campaign of
" insults, jeers, and "
"intimidation. When Slytherins, some "
of them seventh years and consid-
"erably larger than he was, muttered as they passed in the corridors, “Got "
"your bed booked in the hospital wing, Weasley?” he did not laugh, but "
turned a delicate shade of green.
 When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron 
dropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they were within sight of 
"each other), Ron’s ears glowed red an"
d his hands shook so badly that he 
was likely to drop wh
atever he was holding at the time too. 
October extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving 
"rain and November arrived, cold as frozen iron, with hard frosts every "
morning and icy drafts that bit at 
exposed hands and faces. The skies 
and the ceiling of the Great Hall tur
"ned a pale, pearly gray, the moun-"
tains around Hogwarts became sn
"owcapped, and the temperature in "
the castle dropped so far that many
 students wore their thick protec-
tive dragon skin gl
oves in the corridors between lessons. 
The morning of the match dawned bright and cold. When Harry 
awoke he looked around at Ron’
s bed and saw him sitting bolt up-
"right, his arms around his knee"
"s, staring fixedl"
y into space. 
“You all right?” said Harry. 
Ron nodded but did not speak. Harry was reminded forcibly of the 
 402 time that Ron had accidentally pu
t a slug-vomiting charm on himself. 
He looked just as pale and sweaty
" as he had done then, not to men-"
tion as reluctant to open his mouth. 
"“You just need some breakfast,” Harry said bracingly. “C’mon.” "
The Great Hall was filling up fa
"st when they arrived, the talk "
louder and the mood more exuberant 
than usual. As they passed the 
Slytherin table there was an upsurge of noise; Harry looked around 
"and saw that nearly everyone there was wearing, in addition to the "
usual green-and-silver scarves and ha
"ts, silver badges in the shape of "
what seemed to be crowns. For some
 reason many of them waved at 
"Ron, laughing uproariously. Harry "
tried to see what was written on 
"the badges as he walked by, but he"
 was too concerned to get Ron past 
their table quickly to linger 
long enough to read them. 
They received a rousing welcome 
"at the Gryffindor table, where "
"everyone was wearing red and gold, "
but far from raising Ron’s spirits 
the cheers seemed to sap the last of
 his morale; he collapsed onto the 
nearest bench looking as
 though he were facing his final meal. 
"“I must’ve been mental to do this,”"
 he said in a croaky whisper. 
“
Mental.
” 
"“Don’t be thick,” said Harry firmly, "
passing him a choice of cereals. 
“You’re going to be fine. It’s normal to be nervous.” 
"“I’m rubbish,” croaked Ron. “I’m lousy. I can’t play to save my life. "
What was I thinking?” 
"“Get a grip,” said Harry sternly. "
“Look at that save you made with 
"your foot the other day, even Fred an"
d George said it was brilliant —” 
Ron turned a tortured face to Harry. 
"“That was an accident,” he whispere"
d miserably. “I didn’t mean to 
do it — I slipped off my
 broom when none of you were looking and 
I was trying to get back on and I 
kicked the Quaffle by accident.” 
"“Well,” said Harry, recovering qu"
ickly from this unpleasant sur-
"prise, “a few more accidents like that and the game’s in the bag, isn’t it?” "
   403 Hermione and Ginny sat down o
pposite them wearing red-and-
"gold scarves, gloves, and rosettes. "
“How’re you feeling?” Ginny asked 
"Ron, who was now staring into "
the dregs of milk at the bottom of his
 empty cereal bowl as though se-
riously considering attempting
 to drown himse
lf in them. 
"“He’s just nervous,” said Harry. "
"“Well, that’s a good sign, I never feel you perform as well in exams "
"if you’re not a bit nervous,” said Hermione heartily. "
"“Hello,” said a vague and dreamy voice from behind them. Harry "
looked up: Luna Lovegood had drifte
d over from the Ravenclaw table. 
Many people were staring at her and a few openly laughing and point-
ing; she had managed to procure a ha
t shaped like a life-size lion’s 
"head, which was perched precariously on her head. "
"“I’m supporting Gryffindor,” said "
"Luna, pointing unnecessarily at "
her hat. “Look what
 it does. . . .” 
She reached up and tapped the ha
t with her wand. It opened its 
mouth wide and gave an extremely realistic roar that made everyone 
in the vicinity jump. 
"“It’s good, isn’t it?” said Luna happi"
ly. “I wanted to have it chewing 
"up a serpent to represent Slytherin,"
" you know, but there wasn’t time. "
Anyway . . . good 
"luck, Ronald!” "
She drifted away. They had not qu
ite recovered from the shock of 
Luna’s hat before Ange
lina came hurrying towa
"rd them, accompanied "
"by Katie and Alicia, whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned to "
normal by Madam Pomfrey. 
"“When you’re ready,” she said, “we’"
re going to go straight down to 
"the pitch, check out co"
nditions and change.” 
"“We’ll be there in a bit,” Harry assu"
red her. “Ron’s just got to have 
some breakfast.” 
"It became clear after ten minutes,"
" however, that Ron was not capa-"
ble of eating anything more and Ha
rry thought it best to get him  
 404 down to the changing rooms. As th
"ey rose from the table, Hermione "
"got up too, and taking Harry’s "
"arm, she drew him to one side. "
"“Don’t let Ron see what’s on those Slytherins’ badges,” she whis-"
pered urgently. 
"Harry looked questioningly at her,"
 but she shook her head warn-
ingly; Ron had just ambl
"ed over to them, looking lost and desperate. "
"“Good luck, Ron,” said Hermione, st"
anding on tiptoe and kissing 
"him on the cheek. “And you, Harry —” "
Ron seemed to come to himself slightly as they walked back across 
the Great Hall. He touched the spot
 on his face where Hermione had 
"kissed him, looking puzzled,"
 as though he was not quite sure what had 
just happened. He seemed too distra
"cted to notice much around him, "
but Harry cast a curious glance at 
the crown-shaped badges as they 
"passed the Slytherin table, and this "
time he made out the words etched 
onto them: 
With an unpleasant feeling that 
"this could mean nothing good, he "
hurried Ron across the entrance hall
", down the stone steps, and out "
into the icy air. 
The frosty grass crunched under their feet as they hurried down the 
sloping lawns toward the stadium. 
There was no wind
 at all and the 
"sky was a uniform pearly white, whic"
h meant that visibility would be 
good without the drawback of dire
ct sunlight in the eyes. Harry 
"pointed out these encouraging factors to Ron as they walked, but he "
was not sure that Ron was listening. 
Angelina had changed already and was talking to the rest of the 
team when they entered. Harry and 
Ron pulled on their robes (Ron 
attempted to do his up back-to-front 
for several minutes before Alicia 
t
b^pibv
fp=lro=hfkd
   405 took pity on him and went to help
) and then sat down to listen to the 
pre-match talk while the babble of vo
ices outside grew steadily louder 
as the crowd came pouring out of
 the castle toward the pitch. 
"“Okay, I’ve only just "
found out the final lineu
"p for Slytherin,” said "
"Angelina, consulting a piece of parc"
"hment. “Last year’s Beaters, Der-"
"rick and Bole, have left now, but "
it looks as though Montague’s re-
"placed them with the usual gorillas, rather than anyone who can fly "
particularly well. They’re two blokes
" called Crabbe and Goyle, I don’t "
know much about them —” 
"“We do,” said Harry and Ron together. "
"“Well, they don’t look bright en"
ough to tell one end of a broom 
"from another,” said Angelina, pock"
"eting her parchment, “but then I "
was always surprised Derrick and 
Bole managed to find their way 
onto the pitch wi
thout signposts.” 
“Crabbe and Goyle are in the sa
"me mold,” Har"
ry assured her. 
They could hear hundreds of 
footsteps mounting the banked 
"benches of the spectators’ stands now. Some people were singing, "
though Harry could not make out the words. He was starting to feel 
"nervous, but he knew his butterflie"
"s were as nothing to Ron’s, who "
was clutching his stomach and staring 
"straight ahead again, his jaw set "
and his complexion pale gray. 
"“It’s time,” said Angelina in a hu"
"shed voice, looking at her watch. "
“C’mon everyone 
. . . good luck.” 
"The team rose, shouldered their br"
"ooms, and marched in single file "
out of the changing room and into 
the dazzling sunlight. A roar of 
sound greeted them in which Harry co
"uld still hear singing, though it "
was muffled by the cheers and whistles. 
The Slytherin team were standing 
waiting for them. They too were 
wearing those silver crown-shaped
" badges. The new captain, Mon-"
"tague, was built along the same lines as Dudley, with massive forearms "
like hairy hams. Behind him lurked
" Crabbe and Goyle, almost as "
"large, blinking stupidly in the su"
"nlight, swinging their new Beaters’ "
 406 "bats. Malfoy stood to one side, the "
sunlight gleaming on his white-
blond head. He caught Harry’s eye 
"and smirked, tapping the crown-"
shaped badge on his chest. 
"“Captains shake hands,” ordered "
"the umpire, Madam Hooch, as "
Angelina and Montague reached each other. Harry could tell that 
Montague was trying to crush Angeli
"na’s fingers, though she did not "
wince. “Mount your brooms. . . .” 
Madam Hooch placed her whis
tle in her mouth and blew. 
The balls were released and the fourteen players shot upward; out 
of the corner of his eye Harry saw 
Ron streak off toward the goal 
"hoops. He zoomed higher, dodging a "
"Bludger, and set off on a wide "
"lap of the pitch, gazing around for a "
glint of gold; on the other side of 
"the stadium, Draco Malfoy "
was doing exac
tly the same. 
"“And it’s Johnson, Johnson with the "
"Quaffle, what a player that girl "
"is, I’ve been saying it for years bu"
t she still won’t go out with me —” 
“JORDAN!” yelled Professor McGonagall. 
"“Just a fun fact, Professor, adds a "
bit of interest — and she’s ducked 
"Warrington, she’s passed Montague"
", she’s — ouch — been hit from "
behind by a Bludger from Crabbe. . 
. . Montague catc
"hes the Quaffle, "
Montague heading back up the pitc
h and — nice Bludger there from 
"George Weasley, that’s a Bludger to the head for Montague, he drops "
"the Quaffle, caught by Katie Bell"
", Katie Bell of Gryffindor reverse "
passes to Alicia Spinne
t and Spinnet’s away —” 
Lee Jordan’s commentary rang th
rough the stadium and Harry lis-
tened as hard as he could through 
the wind whistling in his ears and 
"the din of the crowd, all yell"
ing and booing and singing — 
"“— dodges Warrington, avoids a "
Bludger — close 
"call, Alicia — "
"and the crowd are loving this, just listen to them, what’s that they’re "
singing?” 
And as Lee paused to listen the so
ng rose loud and clear from the 
sea of green and silver in the 
Slytherin section of the stands: 
   407 Weasley cannot 
"save a thing, "
He cannot block 
"a single ring, "
That’s why Slytherins all sing: 
Weasley is our King.
"Weasley was born in a bin, "
"He always lets the Quaffle in, "
"Weasley will make sure we win, "
Weasley is our King.
"“— and Alicia passes back to Angelina!” Lee shouted, and as Harry "
"swerved, his insides boiling at what he had just heard, he knew Lee "
was trying to drown out the sound 
"of the singing. “Come on now, "
Angelina — looks like she’s got 
just the Keeper to beat! — SHE 
SHOOTS — SHE — aaaah . . .” 
"Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, "
had saved the goal; he threw the 
Quaffle to Warrington who sped off 
"with it, zigzagging in between "
Alicia and Katie; the singing from be
low grew louder and louder as he 
drew nearer and nearer Ron — 
"Weasley is our King, "
"Weasley is our King, "
"He always lets the Quaffle in, "
Weasley is our King.
"Harry could not help himself: Abandoning his search for the Snitch, "
"he turned his Firebolt toward Ron, "
a lone figure at the far end of the 
"pitch, hovering before the three "
goal hoops while the massive War-
rington pelted toward him . . . 
“— and it’s Warrington with the 
"Quaffle, Warrington heading for "
"goal, he’s out of Bludger range "
with just the Ke
eper ahead —” 
A great swell of song rose from
 the Slytherin stands below: 
 408 Weasley cannot 
"save a thing, "
He cannot bloc
k a single ring
 . . . 
"“— so it’s the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper, Weasley, brother "
"of Beaters, Fred and George, and a promising new talent on the "
"team — come on, Ron!” "
But the scream of delight came 
from the Slytherin end: Ron had 
"dived wildly, his arms wide, and the Quaffle had soared between "
"them, straight through Ron’s central hoop. "
“Slytherin score!” came Lee’s voice amid the cheering and booing 
from the crowds below. “So that’s
" ten-nil to Slytherin — bad luck, "
Ron . . .” 
The Slytherins sang even louder: 
"WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN,"
HE ALWAYS LETS
 THE QUAFFLE IN
 . . . 
“— and Gryffindor back in possessi
on and it’s Katie Bell tanking 
up the pitch —” cried Lee valiantl
"y, though the singing was now so "
deafening that he could hardly
 make himself heard above it. 
WEASLEY WILL MAKE 
"SURE WE WIN, "
WEASLEY IS OUR KING
 . . . 
"“Harry, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” "
"screamed Angelina, soaring "
past him to keep up wi
th Katie. “GET GOING!” 
Harry realized that he had been st
ationary in midair for more than 
"a minute, watching the progress of the match without sparing a "
thought for the whereabouts of the 
"Snitch; horrified, he went into a "
"dive and started circling the pitch again, staring around, trying to ig-"
nore the chorus now thunde
ring through the stadium: 
   409 "WEASLEY IS OUR KING, "
WEASLEY IS OUR KING
 . . . 
There was no sign of the Snitch 
anywhere he looked; Malfoy was 
still circling the stadiu
m just like Harry. They passed midway around 
the pitch going in o
pposite directions and Harry heard Malfoy 
"singing loudly, "
WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN
 . . . 
"“— and it’s Warrington again,” bell"
"owed Lee, “who passes to Pucey, "
"Pucey’s off past Spinnet, come on "
"now Angelina, you can take him — "
"turns out you can’t — but nice Bludger from Fred Weasley, I mean, "
"George Weasley, oh who cares, on"
"e of them anyway, and Warrington "
drops the Quaffle and Katie Bell — 
er — drops it too — so that’s 
"Montague with the Quaffle, Slyt"
herin Captain Montague takes the 
"Quaffle, and he’s off up"
" the pitch, come on no"
"w Gryffindor, block him!” "
Harry zoomed around the end of th
e stadium behind the Slytherin 
"goal hoops, willing himself not to l"
ook at what was going on at Ron’s 
end; as he sped past the Slytherin 
"Keeper, he heard Bletchley singing "
"along with the crowd below, "
WEASLEY CANNOT SAVE A THING
 . . . 
"“— and Pucey’s dodged Alicia again,"
 and he’s heading straight for 
"goal, stop it, Ron!” "
Harry did not have to look to se
e what had happened: There was a 
terrible groan from the Gryffindor
" end, coupled with fresh screams "
and applause from the Slytherins
". Looking down, Harry saw the pug-"
"faced Pansy Parkinson right at the front of the stands, her back to the "
pitch as she conducted 
the Slytherin supporters who were roaring: 
 410 THAT’S WHY SLYTHERINS ALL SING: 
WEASLEY IS OUR KING.
"But twenty-nil was nothing, there was still time for Gryffindor to "
"catch up or catch the Snitch, a few go"
als and they would be in the lead 
"as usual, Harry assured himself, "
bobbing and weav
ing through the 
other players in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be 
Montague’s watch strap. . . . 
But Ron let in two more goals. There was an edge of panic in 
Harry’s desire to find the 
Snitch now. If he coul
d just get it soon and 
finish the game quickly . . . 
"“— and Katie Bell of Gryffindor dodges Pucey, ducks Montague, "
"nice swerve, Katie, and she throws"
" to Johnson, Angelina Johnson "
"takes the Quaffle, she’s past Warring"
"ton, she’s heading for goal, come "
on now Angelina — GRYFFINDOR 
"SCORE! It’s forty-ten, forty-"
ten to Slytherin and Pucey has the Quaffle. . . .” 
Harry could hear Luna’s
 ludicrous lion hat roaring amidst the 
"Gryffindor cheers and felt heartened; only thirty points in it, that was "
"nothing, they could pull back ea"
sily. Harry ducked a Bludger that 
Crabbe had sent rocketing in his direction and resumed his frantic 
scouring of the pitch for the Snit
"ch, keeping one eye on Malfoy in "
case he showed signs of having sp
"otted it, but Malfoy, like him, was "
continuing to soar around the st
"adium, searching "
fruitlessly . . . 
"“— Pucey throws to Warrington, Warrington to Montague, Mon-"
tague back to Pucey — Johnson in
"tervenes, Johnson takes the Quaf-"
"fle, Johnson to Bell, this looks g"
ood — I mean bad — Bell’s hit by a 
Bludger from Goyle of Slytherin 
and it’s Pucey 
in possession 
again . . .” 
"WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN, "
HE ALWAYS LETS 
"THE QUAFFLE IN, "
WEASLEY WILL MAKE 
SURE WE WIN —
   411 But Harry had seen it at last: The 
tiny fluttering Golden Snitch was 
hovering feet from the 
ground at the Slytheri
n end of the pitch. 
He dived. . . . 
"In a matter of seconds, Malfoy "
was streaking out of the sky on 
"Harry’s left, a gree"
n-and-silver blur lying fl
at on his broom. . . . 
The Snitch skirted the foot of one of the goal hoops and scooted off 
toward the other side of the stands; 
its change of direction suited Mal-
"foy, who was nearer. Harry pulled his"
" Firebolt around, he and Malfoy "
were now neck 
and neck . . . 
"Feet from the ground, Harry lifted"
" his right hand from his broom, "
stretching toward the Sn
"itch . . . to his right, Malfoy’s arm extended "
"too, reaching, groping . . . "
"It was over in two breathless, desperate, windswept seconds — "
Harry’s fingers closed around the tiny
", struggling ball — Malfoy’s fin-"
gernails scrabbled the back of 
Harry’s hand hopelessly — Harry 
"pulled his broom upward, holding the struggling ball in his hand and "
the Gryffindor spectators sc
reamed their approval. . . . 
"They were saved, it did not matter"
" that Ron had let in those goals, "
nobody would remember as lo
ng as Gryffindor had won — 
WHAM
! 
A Bludger hit Harry squarely in the 
small of the back and he flew 
forward off his broom; luckily he was 
only five or six feet above the 
"ground, having dived so low to catch the Snitch, but he was winded "
all the same as he landed flat on hi
s back on the frozen pitch. He heard 
"Madam Hooch’s shrill whistle, an "
uproar in the stands compounded 
"of catcalls, angry yells and jeering, a thud, then Angelina’s frantic "
voice. 
“Are you all right?” 
"“’Course I am,” said Harry grimly"
", taking her hand and allowing "
her to pull him to his feet. Ma
dam Hooch was zooming toward one 
"of the Slytherin players above him,"
 though he could not see who it 
was at this angle. 
 412 "“It was that thug, Crabbe,” said Angelina angrily. “He whacked the "
Bludger at you the moment he sa
w you’d got the Snitch — but we 
"won, Harry, we won!” "
Harry heard a snort from behind 
"him and turned around, still "
holding the Snitch tightly in his hand: Draco Malfoy had landed close 
"by; white-faced with fury, he "
was still managing to sneer. 
"“Saved Weasley’s neck, haven’t you?"
” he said to Harry. “I’ve never 
seen a worse Keeper . . . but then he was 
born in a bin.
 . . . Did you 
"like my lyrics, Potter?” "
Harry did not answer; he turned away
 to meet the rest of the team 
"who were now landing one by one, "
yelling and punching the air in tri-
"umph, all except Ron, "
who had dismounted from
 his broom over by 
the goalposts and was making his wa
y slowly back to the changing 
rooms alone. 
“We wanted to write another couple
" of verses!” Malfoy called, as "
Katie and Alicia hugged Harry. “But 
we couldn’t find rhymes for fat 
and ugly — we wanted to si
"ng about his mother, see —” "
"“Talk about sour grapes,” said Angelina, casting Malfoy a disgusted "
look. 
“— we couldn’t fit in 
useless loser
" either — for his father, you "
know —” 
Fred and George had realized wh
at Malfoy was talking about. 
Halfway through shaking Harry’s hand
" they stiffened, looking around "
at Malfoy. 
"“Leave it,” said Angelina at once, "
"taking Fred by the arm. “Leave it, "
"Fred, let him yell, he’s just sore"
" he lost, the jumped-up little —” "
"“— but you like the Weasleys, don’t you, Potter?” said Malfoy, "
sneering. “Spend holidays there an
"d everything, don’t you? Can’t see "
"how you stand the stink, but I supp"
ose when you’ve been dragged up 
by Muggles even the Weasle
ys’ hovel smells okay —” 
Harry grabbed hold of George; me
anwhile it was taking the com-
bined efforts of Angelina
", Alicia, and Katie to "
stop Fred leaping on 
   413 "Malfoy, who was laughing openly."
 Harry looked around for Madam 
"Hooch, but she was still berating Cr"
abbe for his illegal Bludger attack. 
"“Or perhaps,” said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, “you can re-"
member what 
your
" mother’s house stank like, Potter, and Weasley’s "
pigsty reminds you of it —” 
Harry was not aware of releasing Ge
"orge, all he knew was that a "
second later both of them were 
sprinting at Malfoy. He had com-
pletely forgotten the fact
 that all the teachers were watching: All he 
wanted to do was cause Malfoy as 
much pain as possible. With no 
"time to draw out his wand, he merely"
 drew back the fi
st clutching the 
Snitch and sank it as hard as he could into Malfoy’s stomach — 
“Harry! HARRY! GEORGE! 
NO
!” 
"He could hear girls’ voices screaming, Malfoy yelling, George "
"swearing, a whistle blowing, and the bellowing of the crowd around "
"him, but he did not care, not until "
somebody in the vicinity yelled 
“
IMPEDIMENTA
!”
and only when he was kn
ocked over backward by 
the force of the spell did he abandon
 the attempt to punch every inch 
of Malfoy he could reach. . . . 
“What do you think you’re doing?”
" screamed Madam Hooch, as "
Harry leapt to his feet again; it wa
s she who had hit him with the Im-
pediment Jinx. She was holding her 
whistle in one hand and a wand 
"in the other, her broom lay abando"
ned several feet away. Malfoy was 
"curled up on the ground, whimpering and moaning, his nose bloody; "
George was sporting a swollen lip; 
Fred was still being forcibly re-
"strained by the three Chasers, and "
Crabbe was cackling in the back-
ground. “I’ve never seen behavior like
" it — back up to the castle, both "
"of you, and straight to your"
 Head of Hous
e’s office! Go! 
Now
!” 
Harry and George marched off the pi
"tch, both panting, neither say-"
ing a word to each other. The howl
ing and jeering of the crowd grew 
"fainter and fainter until they reached the entrance hall, where they "
could hear nothing except the sound 
of their own footsteps. Harry be-
came aware that something was still 
"struggling in his right hand, the "
 414 knuckles of which he had bruised 
against Malfoy’s jaw; looking down 
"he saw the Snitch’s silver wings protruding from between his fingers, "
struggling for release. 
They had barely reache
d the door of Professor McGonagall’s office 
when she came marching along the corridor behind them. She was 
"wearing a Gryffindor scarf, but tore"
 it from her throat with shaking 
"hands as she strode toward them, looking livid. "
"“In!” she said furiously, pointing"
 to the door. Harry and George en-
tered. She strode around behind 
"her desk and faced them, quivering "
with rage as she thre
w the Gryffindor scarf 
aside onto the floor. 
“
Well
?” she said. “I have never seen 
such a disgraceful exhibition. 
Two onto one! Explain yourselves!” 
"“Malfoy provoked us,” said Harry stiffly. "
“Provoked you?” shouted Professo
"r McGonagall, slamming a fist "
onto her desk so that her tartan bi
scuit tin slid sideways off it and 
"burst open, littering the floor with"
" Ginger Newts. “He’d just lost, "
"hadn’t he, of course he wanted to "
provoke you! But what on earth he 
can have said that just
ified what you two —” 
“He insulted my parent
"s,” snarled George. “A"
nd Harry’s mother.” 
"“But instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch to sort out, you two de-"
cided to give an exhibition of 
"Muggle dueling, did you?” bellowed "
Professor McGonagall. “Have you 
any idea what 
you’ve — ?” 
“
"Hem, hem."
” 
George and Harry both spun around. Dolores Umbridge was 
standing in the doorway wrapped in 
a green tweed cloak that greatly 
enhanced her resemblance to a giant 
"toad, and smiling in the horribly "
"sickly, ominous way that Harry had co"
me to associate with imminent 
misery. 
"“May I help, Professor McGonagall?"
” asked Professor Umbridge in 
her most poisonously sweet voice. 
Blood rushed into Profes
sor McGonagall’s face. 
   415 "“Help?” she repeated in a constricted voice. “What do you mean, "
‘help’?” 
Professor Umbridge moved forward in
"to the office, still smiling her "
sickly smile. 
"“Why, I thought you might be gratef"
ul for a little extra authority.” 
Harry would not have been surprised to see sparks fly from Profes-
sor McGonagall’s nostrils. 
"“You thought wrong,” she said, "
turning her back on Umbridge. 
"“Now, you two had better listen clos"
ely. I do not care what provoca-
"tion Malfoy offered you, I do not "
care if he insulted every family 
"member you possess, your behavior "
was disgusting and I am giving 
each of you a week’s worth of detent
"ion! Do not look at me like that, "
"Potter, you deserve it! And if"
 either of you ever —” 
“
"Hem, hem."
” 
Professor McGonagall closed her eyes as though praying for pa-
tience as she turned her face to
ward Professor Umbridge again. 
“
Yes
?” 
“I think they deserve rather more 
"than detentions,” said Umbridge, "
smiling still more broadly. 
"Professor McGonagall’s eyes flew open. “But unfortunately,” she "
"said, with an attempt at a reciproc"
al smile that made her look as 
"though she had lockjaw, “it is what I think that counts, as they are in "
"my House, Dolores.” "
"“Well, "
"actually,"
" Minerva,” simpered Umbrid"
"ge, “I think you’ll find "
that what I think 
does
" count. Now, where is it? Cornelius just sent it. "
". . . I mean,” she gave a little false laugh as she rummaged in her hand-"
"bag, “the "
Minister
 just sent it. . 
. . Ah yes . . .” 
She had pulled out a piece of pa
"rchment that she now unfurled, "
clearing her throat fussily before 
starting to read
 what it said. 
“
"Hem, hem"
 . . . ‘Educational Decree 
Number Twenty-five . . .’” 
“Not another one!” exclaimed Professor McGonagall violently. 
 416 "“Well, yes,” said Umbridge, still sm"
"iling. “As a matter of fact, Min-"
"erva, it was you who made me see that we "
needed
 a further amend-
ment. . . . You remember how you 
"overrode me, when I was unwilling "
to allow the Gryffindor Quidditch team to re-form? How you took 
"the case to Dumbledore, who insisted that the team be allowed to "
"play? Well, now, I couldn’t have that"
". I contacted the Minister at once, "
and he quite agreed with me that the High Inquisitor has to have the 
"power to strip pupils of privileges, "
"or she — that is to say, I — would "
have less authority than common 
"teachers! And you see now, don’t "
"you, Minerva, how right I was in attempting to stop the Gryffindor "
team re-forming? 
Dreadful
" tempers . . . Anyway, I was reading out our "
amendment . . . 
"hem, hem"
 . . . ‘The High Inquisitor will henceforth 
have supreme authority over all pu
"nishments, sanctions, and removal "
of privileges pertaining to the stud
"ents of Hogwarts, and the power to "
"alter such punishments, sanctions, "
and removals of privileges as may 
have been ordered by other staff 
"members. Signed, Cornelius Fudge, "
"Minister of Magic, Order of Merlin"
" First Class, et"
"c., etc. . . .’” "
She rolled up the parchment and put 
"it back into her handbag, still "
smiling. 
“So . . . I really think I will ha
ve to ban these two from playing 
"Quidditch ever again,” she said, looking from Harry to George and "
back again. 
Harry felt the Snitch flutte
ring madly in his hand. 
"“Ban us?” he said, and his voice "
sounded strangely distant. “From 
playing . . . ever again?” 
"“Yes, Mr. Potter, I think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick,” said "
"Umbridge, her smile widening still "
further as she watched him strug-
gle to comprehend what she had said. “You 
and
 Mr. Weasley here. 
"And I think, to be safe, this young man’s twin ought to be stopped "
too — if his teammates had not rest
"rained him, I feel sure he would "
have attacked young Mr. Malfoy as 
well. I will want their broomsticks 
"confiscated, of course; I shall keep th"
"em safely in my office, to make "
   417 "sure there is no infringement of my ban. But I am not unreasonable, "
"Professor McGonagall,” she contin"
"ued, turning back to Professor "
McGonagall who was now standing as 
still as though ca
"rved from ice, "
"staring at her. “The rest of the team can continue playing, I saw no "
signs of violence from any of 
them.
 Well . . . good afternoon to you.” 
And with a look of the utmost sati
sfaction Umbridge
" left the room, "
leaving a horrified silence in her wake. 
"“Banned,” said Angelina in a hollow"
" voice, late that evening in the "
common room. “
Banned.
 No Seeker and no Beaters . . . What on 
earth are we going to do?” 
It did not feel as though they ha
d won the match at all. Everywhere 
Harry looked there were disconsolate
 and angry faces; the team them-
"selves were slumped around the fire, all apart from Ron, who had not "
been seen since the end of the match. 
"“It’s just so unfair,” said Alic"
"ia numbly. “I mean, what about "
Crabbe and that Bludger he hit af
ter the whistle ha
d been blown? Has 
she banned 
him
?” 
"“No,” said Ginny miserably; she "
and Hermione were sitting on ei-
ther side of Harry. “He just got 
"lines, I heard Montague laughing "
about it at dinner.” 
“And banning Fred when he didn’t
 even do anything!” said Alicia 
"furiously, pummeling he"
r knee with her fist. 
"“It’s not my fault I didn’t,” said Fred, with a very ugly look on his "
face. “I would’ve pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three 
hadn’t been holding me back.” 
Harry stared miserably at the dark
 window. Snow was falling. The 
Snitch he had caught earlier was 
now zooming around and around the 
common room; people were watching its progress as though hyp-
notized and Crookshanks was leaping 
"from chair to chair, trying to "
catch it. 
"“I’m going to bed,” said Angelina, getting slowly to her feet. "
 418 “Maybe this will all turn
 out to have been a bad dream. . . . Maybe I’ll 
wake up tomorrow and find we haven’t played yet. . . .” 
She was soon followed by Alicia an
d Katie. Fred and George sloped 
"off to bed some time later, glow"
"ering at everyone they passed, and "
Ginny went not long after that. On
ly Harry and Hermione were left 
beside the fire. 
“Have you seen Ron?” Hermio
ne asked in a low voice. 
Harry shook his head. 
“I think he’s avoiding
" us,” said Hermione"
. “Where do you think 
he — ?” 
"But at that precise moment, there was a creaking sound behind "
them as the Fat Lady swung fo
rward and Ron came clambering 
through the portrait hole. He was very pale indeed and there was 
snow in his hair. When he saw 
Harry and Hermione he stopped dead 
in his tracks. 
"“Where have you been?” said Hermione anxiously, springing up. "
"“Walking,” Ron mumbled. He wa"
s still wearing his Quidditch 
things. 
"“You look frozen,” said He"
rmione. “Come an
d sit down!” 
Ron walked to the fireside and sa
nk into the chair farthest from 
"Harry’s, not looking at him. The "
stolen Snitch zoomed over their 
heads. 
"“I’m sorry,” Ron mumbled,"
 looking at his feet. 
“What for?” said Harry. 
"“For thinking I can play Quidditch,"
” said Ron. “I’m going to resign 
first thing tomorrow.” 
"“If you resign,” said Harry testily, “t"
here’ll only be three players left 
on the team.” And when Ron looked
" puzzled, he said, “I’ve been "
given a lifetime ban. So
’ve Fred and George.” 
“What?” Ron yelped. 
Hermione told him the full story; 
Harry could not bear to tell it 
"again. When she had finished, Ron looked more anguished than ever. "
   419 “This is all my fault —” 
“You didn’t 
make
" me punch Malfoy,” "
said Harry angrily. 
“— if I wasn’t so lo
usy at Quidditch —” 
“— it’s got nothing 
to do with that —” 
“— it was that song 
that wound me up —” 
“— it would’ve wo
und anyone up —” 
Hermione got up and walked to 
"the window, away from the argu-"
"ment, watching the snow swir"
ling down against the pane. 
"“Look, drop it, will yo"
u!” Harry burst out. “It’s bad enough with-
out you blaming yourself for everything!” 
Ron said nothing but sat gazing mi
serably at the damp hem of his 
robes. After a while he said in a dull 
"voice, “This is the worst I’ve ever "
felt in my life.” 
"“Join the club,” sa"
id Harry bitterly. 
"“Well,” said Hermione, her voice tr"
embling slightly. “I can think of 
one thing that might 
cheer you both up.” 
“Oh yeah?” said Ha
rry skeptically. 
"“Yeah,” said Hermione, turning away from the pitch-black, snow-"
"flecked window, a broad smile spreading across her face. “Hagrid’s "
back.” 
Harry sprinted up to the boys’ 
dormitory to fetch the Invisi-
bility Cloak and the Marauder’s Map from his trunk; he was 
so quick that he and Ron were ready 
to leave at least five minutes be-
fore Hermione hurried back down fr
om the girls’ do
"rmitories, wear-"
"ing scarf, gloves, and one of her own knobbly elf hats. "
"“Well, it’s cold out there!” she sa"
"id defensively, as Ron clicked his "
tongue impatiently. 
They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves 
hastily in the cloak 
— Ron had grown so much he now needed to 
"crouch to prevent his feet showing — then, moving slowly and cau-"
"tiously, they proceeded down the many"
" staircases, pausing at intervals "
to check the map for signs of Filch 
or Mrs. Norris. They were lucky; 
"they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick, who was gliding along "
absentmindedly humming somethin
g that sounded horribly like 
“Weasley Is Our King.” They crep
t across the entrance hall and then 
"out into the silent, snowy grounds. "
"With a great leap of his heart, "
Harry saw little golden squares of 
light ahead and smoke coiling up 
from Hagrid’s chimney. He set o
"ff at a quick march, the other two "
H 
   421 "jostling and bumping along behind him, and they crunched excitedly "
through the thickening snow until 
at last they reached the wooden 
front door; when Harry raised his fist
" and knocked three times, a dog "
started barking frantically inside. 
"“Hagrid, it’s us!” Harry called through the keyhole. "
“Shoulda known!” said a gruff voice. 
They beamed at one another under 
the cloak; they could tell that 
Hagrid’s voice was pleased. “Bin ho
"me three seconds . . . Out the way, "
Fang . . . 
"Out the way,"
 yeh dozy dog . . .” 
"The bolt was drawn back, the door"
" creaked open, and Hagrid’s "
head appeared in the gap. 
Hermione screamed. 
"“Merlin’s beard, keep it down!” said"
" Hagrid hastily, staring wildly "
"over their heads. “Under that cloak, are yeh? Well, get in, get in!” "
"“I’m sorry!” Hermione gasped, as th"
e three of them squeezed past 
Hagrid into the house and pulled the cloak off themselves so he could 
"see them. “I just — oh, "
Hagrid
!” 
"“It’s nuthin’, it’s nuthin’!” said "
"Hagrid hastily, shutting the door "
behind them and hurrying to clos
"e all the curtains, but Hermione "
continued to gaze up
 at him in horror. 
Hagrid’s hair was matted with co
"ngealed blood, and his left eye had "
been reduced to a puffy slit amid a 
mass of purple-and-black bruises. 
There were many cuts on his face an
"d hands, some of them still bleed-"
"ing, and he was moving gingerly"
", which made Harry suspect broken "
ribs. It was obvious that
 he had only just got 
home; a thick black trav-
eling cloak lay over the back of a 
chair and a haversack large enough 
to carry several small c
hildren leaned against the wall inside the door. 
"Hagrid himself, twice the size of"
 a normal man and three times as 
"broad, was now limping over to th"
e fire and placing a copper kettle 
over it. 
"“What happened to you?” Harry demanded, while Fang danced "
"around them all, trying to lick their faces. "
 422 "“Told yeh, "
nuthin
"’,” said Hagrid firmly. “Want a cuppa?” "
"“Come off it,” said Ron, “you’re in a right state!” "
"“I’m tellin’ yeh, I’m fine,” said "
"Hagrid, straightening up and turn-"
"ing to beam at them all, but wincin"
"g. “Blimey, it’s good ter see you "
"three again — had good summers, did yeh?” "
"“Hagrid, you’ve been "
attacked!” said Ron. 
“Fer the las’ time
", it’s nuthin’!” sa"
id Hagrid firmly. 
“Would you say it was nothing if o
ne of us turned up with a pound 
of mince instead of a 
face?” Ron demanded. 
“You ought to go and see Madam 
"Pomfrey, Hagrid,” said Hermi-"
one anxiously. “Some of those cuts look nasty.” 
"“I’m dealin’ with it, all righ’?” said Hagrid repressively. "
He walked across to the enormou
s wooden table that stood in the 
middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying 
"on it. Underneath was a raw, bloody"
", green-tinged steak slightly larger "
than the average car tire. 
"“You’re not going to eat that, are "
"you, Hagrid?” said Ron, leaning "
in for a closer look. “It looks poisonous.” 
"“It’s s’posed ter look like that, it’s"
" dragon meat,” Hagrid said. “An’ I "
didn’ get it ter eat.” 
He picked up the steak and slapped it
 over the left side of his face. 
Greenish blood trickled down into his be
ard as he gave a soft moan of 
satisfaction. 
“Tha’s better. It helps with
" the stingin’, yeh know.” "
“So are you going to tell us what’s
 happened to you?” Harry asked. 
"“Can’, Harry. Top secret. More’n me job’s worth ter tell yeh that.” "
"“Did the giants beat you up, Hagrid?” asked Hermione quietly. "
Hagrid’s fingers slipped on the drag
"on steak, and it slid squelchily "
onto his chest. 
"“Giants?” said Hagrid, catching the "
steak before it reached his belt 
and slapping it back over his face. 
“Who said anythin’ abou’ giants?  
   423 Who yeh bin talkin’ to? Who’s told yeh what I’ve — who’s said I’ve 
bin — eh?” 
"“We guessed,” said Hermione apologetically. "
"“Oh, yeh did, did yeh?” said Hagrid"
", fixing her sternly with the eye "
that was not hidden by the steak. 
"“It was kind of . . . obvious,” said Ron. Harry nodded. "
"Hagrid glared at them, then snorte"
"d, threw the steak onto the table "
again and strode back to the ke
"ttle, which was now whistling. "
“Never known kids like you three 
"fer knowin’ more’n yeh oughta,” "
"he muttered, splashing boiling wate"
r into three of his bucket-shaped 
mugs. “An’ I’m not complimentin’ ye
"h, neither. Nosy, some’d call it. "
Interferin’.” 
But his beard twitched. 
"“So you have been to look for giants?” said Harry, grinning as he sat "
down at the table. 
Hagrid set tea in front of each 
"of them, sat down, picked up his "
"steak again, and slapped "
it back over his face. 
"“Yeah, all righ’,” he grunted, “I have.” "
“And you found them?” said He
rmione in a hushed voice. 
"“Well, they’re not that difficult te"
"r find, ter be honest,” said Hagrid. "
"“Pretty big, see.” "
“Where are they?” said Ron. 
"“Mountains,” said Ha"
grid unhelpfully. 
“So why don’t Muggles — ?” 
"“They do,” said Hagrid darkly. “O"
’ny their deaths are always put 
down ter mountaineerin’ ac
"cidents, aren’ they?” "
He adjusted the steak a little so 
that it covered the worst of the 
bruising. 
"“Come on, Hagrid, tell us what you’"
ve been up to!” 
said Ron. “Tell 
us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about be-
ing attacked by the dementors —” 
 424 Hagrid choked in his mug and dro
pped his steak at the same time; 
"a large quantity of spit, tea, and "
dragon blood was sprayed over the 
"table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid, with a soft "
"splat,"
 onto the floor. 
"“Whadda yeh mean, attacked by dementors?” growled Hagrid. "
"“Didn’t you know?” Hermione asked him, wide-eyed. "
“I don’ know anything that’s been 
happenin’ since I left. I was on a 
"secret mission, wasn’ I, didn’ wan’"
 owls followin’ me all over the 
place — ruddy dementors!
 Yeh’re not serious?” 
"“Yeah, I am, they turned up in "
Little Whinging and attacked my 
"cousin and me, and then the Mini"
stry of Magic expelled me —” 
“WHAT?” 
“— and I had to go to a hearing 
"and everything, but tell us about "
the giants first.” 
“You were 
expelled
?” 
“Tell us about your summer an
d I’ll tell yo
u about mine.” 
Hagrid glared at him through his 
one open eye. Harry looked right 
"back, an expression of innoce"
nt determination on his face. 
"“Oh, all righ’,” Hagrid sa"
id in a resigned voice. 
He bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fang’s mouth. 
"“Oh, Hagrid, don’t, it’s not hygien —” Hermione began, but Ha-"
grid had already slapped the meat ba
ck over his swollen eye. He took 
another fortifying gulp of tea and th
"en said, “Well, we set off righ’ af-"
ter term ended —” 
"“Madame Maxime went with you, then?” Hermione interjected. "
"“Yeah, tha’s right,” said Hagrid, "
and a softened expression appeared 
on the few inches of face that we
re not obscured by beard or green 
"steak. “Yeah, it was jus’ the pair "
"of us. An’ I’ll tell yeh this, she’s not "
"afraid of roughin’ it, Olympe. Ye"
"h know, she’s a fine, well-dressed "
"woman, an’ knowin’ where we was goin’ I wondered ’ow she’d feel "
abou’ clamberin’ over bo
ulders an’ sleepin’ in 
"caves an’ tha’, bu’ she "
never complained once.” 
   425 “You knew where you were going?
” Harry asked. “You knew where 
the giants were?” 
"“Well, Dumbledore knew, an’ "
"he told us,” said Hagrid. "
"“Are they hidden?” asked Ron. “Is it a secret, where they are?” "
"“Not really,” said Hagrid, shaking "
his shaggy head. “It’s jus’ that 
"mos’ wizards aren’ bothered where they are, s’ long as it’s a good long "
way away. But where they are’s very 
"difficult ter get ter, fer humans "
"anyway, so we needed Dumbledore’s instructions. Took us abou’ a "
month ter get there —” 
“A 
month
"?” said Ron, as though he had never heard of a journey "
lasting such a ridiculously long ti
me. “But — why couldn’t you just 
grab a Portkey or something?” 
There was an odd expression in Ha
grid’s unobscured eye as he 
squinted at Ron; it was almost pitying. 
"“We’re bein’ watched, Ro"
"n,” he said gruffly. "
“What d’you mean?” 
"“Yeh don’ understand,” said Hagrid. “The Ministry’s keepin’ an eye "
on Dumbledore an’ anyone 
"they reckon’s in league with him, an’ —” "
"“We know about that,” said Harry "
"quickly, keen to hear the rest "
of Hagrid’s story. “We know about the Ministry watching Dumble-
dore —” 
"“So you couldn’t use magic to get there?” asked Ron, looking thun-"
derstruck. “You had 
to act like Muggles 
all the way
?” 
"“Well, not exactly all the way,” said"
 Hagrid cagily. “We jus’ had ter 
"be careful, ’cause "
"Olympe an’ me, we "
stick out a bit —” 
Ron made a stifled noise somewh
ere between a snort and a sniff 
and hastily took a gulp of tea. 
“— so we’re not hard ter follow. We
 was pretendin’ we was goin’ on 
"holiday together, so we got inter "
France an’ we made like we was 
"headin’ fer where Olympe’s school is, ’cause we knew we was bein’ "
"tailed by someone from the Ministry. We had to go slow, ’cause I’m "
not really s’posed ter use magic an’ 
we knew the Ministry’d be lookin’ 
 426 fer a reason ter run us in. But we managed ter give the berk tailin’ us 
the slip round abou’ Dee-John —” 
"“Ooooh, Dijon?” said Hermione exci"
tedly. “I’ve been there on hol-
"iday, did you see — ?” "
She fell silent at the look on Ron’s face. 
"“We chanced a bit o’ magic after that, and it wasn’ a bad journey. "
Ran inter a couple o’ mad trolls on 
"the Polish border, an’ I had a sligh’ "
disagreement with a vampire in a pu
"b in Minsk, but apart from tha’, "
couldn’t’a bin smoother. 
"“An’ then we reached the place, an"
’ we started trekkin’ up through 
"the mountains, lookin’ "
fer signs of ’em . . . 
“We had ter lay off the ma
gic once we got near ’em. Partly ’cause they 
"don’ like wizards an’ we didn’ want ter put their backs up too soon, and "
partly ’cause Dumbledore had warned us You-Know-Who was bound 
ter be after the giants an’ all. Said 
it was odds on he’d sent a messenger 
off ter them already. Told us ter be
 very careful of drawin’ attention ter 
ourselves as we got near
er in case there was Death Eaters around.” 
Hagrid paused for a long draft of tea. 
“Go on!” said Harry urgently. 
"“Found ’em,” said Hagrid baldly. "
“Went over a ridge one nigh’ an’ 
"there they was, spread ou’ underneath"
 us. Little fires burnin’ below an’ 
huge shadows . . . It was like watchi
n’ bits o’ the mo
untain movin’.” 
“How big are they
?” asked Ron in a hushed voice. 
"“’Bout twenty feet,” said Hagrid "
casually. “Some o’ the bigger ones 
mighta bin twenty-five.” 
“And how many were there?” asked Harry. 
“I reckon abou’ seventy or
" eighty,” said Hagrid. "
“Is that all?” said Hermione. 
"“Yep,” said Hagrid sadly, “eighty left, an’ there was loads once, "
musta bin a hundred diff’rent tribes
 from all over the world. But 
they’ve bin dyin’ out fer ages. Wizard
"s killed a few, o’ course, but  "
   427 "mostly they killed each other, an’ "
now they’re dyin’ out faster than 
ever. They’re not made ter live bunc
hed up together like tha’. Dumb-
"ledore says it’s our fault, it was th"
e wizards who forced ’em to go an’ 
made ’em live a good long way from 
us an’ they had no choice but ter 
stick together fer th
eir own protection.” 
"“So,” said Harry, “you saw them and then what?” "
"“Well, we waited till morning, didn"
’ want ter go sneakin’ up on ’em 
"in the dark, fer our own safety,” said Hagrid. “’Bout three in the "
mornin’ they fell asleep jus’ where th
ey was sittin’. We didn’ dare sleep. 
"Fer one thing, we wanted ter make sure none of ’em woke up an’ "
"came up where we were, an’ fer another, the snorin’ was unbelievable. "
Caused an avalanch
e near mornin’. 
"“Anyway, once it was light "
we wen’ down 
ter see ’em.” 
"“Just like that?” said Ron, look"
ing awestruck. “You just walked 
right into a giant camp?” 
"“Well, Dumbledore’d told us how te"
"r do it,” said Hagrid. “Give the "
"Gurg gifts, show some"
" respect, yeh know.” "
“Give the 
what
 gifts?” asked Harry. 
"“Oh, the Gurg — "
means the chief.” 
“How could you tell which on
e was the Gurg?” asked Ron. 
Hagrid grunted in amusement. 
"“No problem,” he said. “He was th"
"e biggest, the ugliest, an’ the "
laziest. Sittin’ there waitin’ ter be
 brought food by the others. Dead 
goats an’ such like. Name o’ Ka
"rkus. I’d put him at twenty-two, "
"twenty-three feet, an’ the weight of "
a couple o’ bull elephants. Skin 
like rhino hide an’ all.” 
“And you just walked up to him?” said Hermione breathlessly. 
“Well . . . 
down
" ter him, where he was lyin"
’ in the valley. They was 
"in this dip between four pretty high mountains, see, beside a moun-"
"tain lake, an’ Karkus was lyin’ by the lake roarin’ at the others ter feed "
him an’ his wife. Olympe an’ I 
went down the mountainside —” 
 428 “But didn’t they try and kill 
you when they saw you?” asked Ron 
incredulously. 
"“It was def’nitely on some of their minds,” said Hagrid, shrugging, "
“but we did what Dumbledore told 
"us ter do, which was ter hold our "
gift up high an’ keep our eyes on
 the Gurg an’ ignore the others. So 
tha’s what we did. An’ 
the rest of ’em went qu
iet an’ watched us pass 
an’ we got right up ter Karkus’s feet an’ we bowed an’ put our present 
down in front o’ him.” 
“What do you give a giant?” asked Ron eagerly. “Food?” 
"“Nah, he can get food all righ’ fer "
"himself,” said Hagrid. “We took "
"him magic. Giants like magic, jus’ "
don’t like us usin’ it against ’em. 
"Anyway, that firs’ day we gave hi"
m a branch o’ Gubraithian fire.” 
"Hermione said “wow” softly, bu"
t Harry and Ron both frowned in 
puzzlement. 
“A branch of — ?” 
"“Everlasting fire,” said Hermione i"
"rritably, “you ought to know that "
"by now, Professor Flitwi"
ck’s mentioned it at 
least twice in class!” 
"“Well anyway,” said Hagrid quickl"
"y, intervening before Ron could "
"answer back, “Dumbledore’d bewitc"
hed this branch to burn ever-
"more, which isn’ somethin’ any wizard"
" could do, an’ so I lies it down "
in the snow by Karkus’s feet and says
", ‘A gift to the Gurg of the giants "
"from Albus Dumbledore, who send"
s his respectful greetings.’” 
“And what did Karkus sa
y?” asked Harry eagerly. 
"“Nothin’,” said Hagrid. “Didn’ speak English.” "
“You’re kidding!” 
"“Didn’ matter,” said Hagrid im"
"perturbably, “Dumbledore had "
warned us tha’ migh’ ha
ppen. Karkus knew enou
gh to yell fer a cou-
ple o’ giants who knew our ling
o an’ they translated fer us.” 
“And did he like the present?” asked Ron. 
"“Oh yeah, it went down a storm "
once they understood what it 
"was,” said Hagrid, turning his dragon"
 steak over to press the cooler  
   429 side to his swollen eye. “Very please
"d. So then I said, ‘Albus Dumble-"
dore asks the Gurg to speak with his
 messenger when he returns to-
morrow with another gift.’” 
“Why couldn’t you speak to th
em that day?” asked Hermione. 
“Dumbledore wanted us ter take it
" very slow,” said Hagrid. “Let "
’em see we kept our promises. 
We’ll come back tomorrow with another 
"present,"
 an’ then we do come back with another present — gives a 
"good impression, see? An’ gives them time ter test out the firs’ present "
"an’ find out it’s a good one, an’ get "
"’em eager fer more. In any case, gi-"
ants like Karkus — overload ’em wi
th information an’ they’ll kill yeh 
jus’ to simplify things. So we bowed outta the way an’ went off an’ 
found ourselves a nice little cave 
"ter spend that night in, an’ the fol-"
lowin’ mornin’ we went back an’ this time we found Karkus sittin’ up 
waitin’ fer us lookin’ all eager.” 
“And you talked to him?” 
“Oh yeah. Firs’ we presented him 
with a nice battle helmet — 
"goblin-made an’ indestructible, yeh know — an’ then we sat down an’ "
we talked.” 
“What did he say?” 
"“Not much,” said Hagrid. “Liste"
ned mostly. But there were good 
"signs. He’d heard o’ Dumbledore, he"
ard he’d argued ag
ainst the killin’ 
of the last giants in Britain. Karkus
 seemed ter be quite int’rested in 
what Dumbledore had ter say. An’ a 
"few o’ the others, ’specially the "
"ones who had some English, they ga"
thered round an’ listened too. We 
were hopeful when we left that day.
 Promised ter come back next day 
with another present. 
“But that night it all wen’ wrong.” 
“What d’you mean?” said Ron quickly. 
"“Well, like I say, they"
"’re not meant ter live together, giants,” said "
Hagrid sadly. “Not in big groups li
"ke that. They can’ help themselves, "
they half kill each other every few 
weeks. The men fight each other an’  
 430 "the women fight each other, the remn"
ants of the old tribes fight each 
"other, an’ that’s even without squabb"
les over food an’ the best fires an’ 
"sleepin’ spots. Yeh’d think, seein’ as"
 how their whole race is abou’ fin-
"ished, they’d lay off each other, but . . .” "
Hagrid sighed deeply 
"“That night a fight broke out, we"
 saw it from the mouth of our 
"cave, lookin’ down on the valley. W"
"ent on fer hours, yeh wouldn’ be-"
lieve the noise. An’ when the sun ca
me up the snow was scarlet an’ his 
head was lyin’ at the 
bottom o’ the lake.” 
“Whose head?” gasped Hermione. 
"“Karkus’s,” said Hagrid heavily. “There was a new Gurg, Golgo-"
"math.” He sighed deeply. “Well, "
we hadn’ bargained on a new Gurg 
two days after we’d made friendly co
"ntact with the firs’ one, an’ we had "
a funny feelin’ Golgomath wouldn’ be 
"so keen ter listen to us, but we "
had ter try.” 
“You went to speak to him?” aske
d Ron incredulously. “After you’d 
watched him rip off an
other giant’s head?” 
"“ ’Course we did,” said Hagrid, “w"
e hadn’ gone all that way ter give 
up after two days! We wen’ down with the next present we’d meant ter 
give ter Karkus. 
“I knew it was no go before I’
d opened me mouth. He was sitting 
"there wearin’ Karkus’s helmet, leerin’ "
at us as we got nearer. He’s mas-
"sive, one o’ the biggest ones there. "
Black hair an’ matchin’ teeth an’ a 
necklace o’ bones. Human-lookin’ bones
", some of ’em. Well, I gave it "
a go — held out a great roll o’ dragon skin — an’ said A gift fer the 
Gurg of the giants —’ Nex’ thing 
"I knew, I was hangin’ upside down "
"in the air by me feet, two of"
 his mates had grabbed me.” 
Hermione clapped her 
hands to her mouth. 
“How did you get out of 
that
?”
asked Harry. 
"“Wouldn’ta done if Olympe hadn’ bin there,” said Hagrid. “She "
pulled out her wand an’ did some o’ th
e fastes’ spellwork I’ve ever seen.  
   431 Ruddy marvelous. Hit the two holdin
’ me right in the eyes with Con-
junctivitus Curses an’ they droppe
d me straightaway — bu’ we were 
"in trouble then, ’cause we’d used ma"
"gic against ’em, an’ that’s what gi-"
ants hate abou’ wizards. We had te
r leg it an’ we knew there was no 
way we was going ter be able 
ter march inter camp again.” 
"“Blimey, Hagrid,” said Ron quietly. "
“So how come it’s taken you so long
 to get home if you were only 
there for three days?” asked Hermione. 
“We didn’ leave after three days!”
" said Hagrid, looking outraged. "
“Dumbledore was relyin’ on us!” 
“But you’ve just said there was no way you could go back!” 
"“Not by daylight, we couldn’, no"
. We just had ter rethink a bit. 
Spent a couple o’ days lyin’ low up in the cave an’ watchin’. An’ wha’ 
we saw wasn’ good.” 
“Did he rip off more heads?” aske
"d Hermione, sounding squeamish. "
"“No,” said Hagrid. "
“I wish he had.” 
“What d’you mean?” 
“I mean we soon found out he didn’ 
object ter all wizards — just us.” 
“Death Eaters?” sa
id Harry quickly. 
"“Yep,” said Hagrid darkly. “Coupl"
e of ’em were visitin’ him ev’ry 
"day, bringin’ gifts ter the Gurg, an"
’ he wasn’ dangling them upside 
down.” 
“How d’you know they were 
Death Eaters?” said Ron. 
"“Because I recognized one of ’em,” Hagrid growled. “Macnair, re-"
member him? Bloke they sent ter ki
"ll Buckbeak? Maniac, he is. Likes "
"killin’ as much as Golgomath, no wonder they were gettin’ on so well.” "
“So Macnair’s persuaded the giants
 to join You-Know-Who?” said 
Hermione desperately. 
"“Hold yer hippogriffs, I haven’ fini"
shed me story yet!” said Hagrid 
"indignantly, who, considering he had not wanted to tell them any-"
"thing in the first place, now seemed "
to be rather enjoying himself. “Me  
 432 an’ Olympe talked it over an’ we 
"agreed, jus’ ’cause the Gurg looked "
like favorin’ You-Know-Who didn’ mean all of ’em would. We had ter 
try an’ persuade some o’ the othe
"rs, the ones who hadn’ wanted Gol-"
gomath as Gurg.” 
“How could you tell which ones
 they were?” asked Ron. 
"“Well, they were the ones bein’ be"
"aten to a pulp, weren’ they?” said "
Hagrid patiently. “The ones with any sense were keepin’ outta Golgo-
"math’s way, hidin’ out in caves roun’ the gully jus’ like we were. So we "
decided we’d go pokin’ round the ca
ves by night an’ see if we couldn’ 
persuade a few o’ them.” 
“You went poking around dark ca
ves looking for giants?” said Ron 
with awed respec
t in his voice. 
"“Well, it wasn’ the giants who wo"
"rried us most,” said Hagrid. “We "
were more concerned abou’ the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had told us 
before we wen’ not ter tangle with ’e
m if we could avoi
"d it, an’ the trou-"
ble was they knew we was around — ’spect Golgomath told him abou’ 
us. At night when the giants were sleepin’ an’ we wanted ter be creepin’ 
"inter the caves, Macnair an’ the ot"
her one were sneakin’ round the 
mountains lookin’ fer us. I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin’ out 
"at them,” said Hagrid, the corners of"
 his mouth lifting his wild beard. 
“She was rarin’ ter attack ’em. . 
". . she’s somethin’ when she’s roused, "
"Olympe. . . . Fiery, yeh kn"
ow . . . ’spect it’s th
e French in her . . .” 
Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into th
e fire. Harry allowed him thirty 
seconds’ reminiscence before 
clearing his throat loudly. 
“So what happened? Did you ever ge
t near any of the other giants?” 
"“What? Oh . . . oh yeah, we did."
" Yeah, on the third night after "
"Karkus was killed, we crept outta "
the cave we’d bin hidin’ in and 
"headed back down inter the gully, "
keepin’ our eyes skinned fer the 
Death Eaters. Got inside a few o’ th
"e caves, no go — then, in abou’ "
"the sixth one, we found "
three giants hidin’.” 
"“Cave must’ve been cramped,” said Ron. "
   433 "“Wasn’ room ter swing a kneazle,” said Hagrid. "
“Didn’t they attack you when 
they saw you?” asked Hermione. 
“Probably woulda done if they’d 
"bin in any condition,” said Ha-"
"grid, “but they was badly hurt, all "
three o’ them. Golgomath’s lot had 
beaten ’em unconscious; they’d wo
ken up an’ crawled inter the near-
"est shelter they could find. Anyway, "
one o’ them had a bit of English 
"an’ ’e translated fer the others, an’ what we had ter say didn’ seem ter "
go down too badly. So we kep’ goin’ 
"back, visitin’ the wounded. . . . I "
reckon we had ab
ou’ six or seven o’ them 
convinced at one poin’.” 
“Six or seven?” said Ron eagerly.
 “Well that’s not bad — are they 
going to come over here and start 
fighting You-Know-Who with us?” 
"But Hermione said, “What do you "
"mean ‘at one point,’ Hagrid?” "
Hagrid looked at her sadly. 
“Golgomath’s lot raided the caves.
 The ones tha’ survived didn’ 
wan’ no more ter to do with us after that.” 
"“So . . . so there aren’t any giants coming?” said Ron, looking "
disappointed. 
"“Nope,” said Hagrid, heaving a deep"
 sigh as he turned over his 
steak again and applied the cooler side
" to his face, “but we did wha’ we "
"meant ter do, we gave ’em Dumbledore’s message an’ some o’ them "
"heard it an’ I ’spect some o’ them’ll remember it. Jus’ maybe, them that "
"don’ want ter stay around Golgomath’ll move outta the mountains, "
an’ there’s gotta be a chance they’l
l remember Dumbledore’s friendly 
to ’em. . . . Could be
 they’ll come . . .” 
Snow was filling up the window 
now. Harry became aware that the 
knees of his robes were soaked th
rough; Fang was drooling with his 
head in Harry’s lap. 
“Hagrid?” said Hermione 
quietly after a while. 
“Mmm?” 
“Did you . . . was there any sign of
 . . . did you hear anything about 
your . . . your . . . moth
er while you were there?” 
 434 Hagrid’s unobscured eye rested 
"upon her, and Hermione looked "
rather scared. 
“I’m sorry . . . I . 
. . forget it —” 
"“Dead,” Hagrid grunted. “Died years ago. They told me.” "
"“Oh . . . I’m . . . I’m really sorry,” said Hermione in a very small "
voice. 
"Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders. “No need,” he said shortly. "
“Can’ remember her much. Wasn’ a great mother.” 
They were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and 
"Ron, plainly wanting them to speak. "
“But you still haven’t ex
"plained how you got in this state, Hagrid,” "
"Ron said, gesturing toward "
Hagrid’s bloodstained face. 
"“Or why you’re back so late,” "
said Harry. “Sirius says Madame 
Maxime got back ages ago —” 
“Who attacked you?” said Ron. 
“I haven’ bin attacked!” said Hagrid emphatically. “I —” 
But the rest of his words were 
drowned in a sudden outbreak of 
rapping on the door. Hermione gasp
ed; her mug slipped through her 
fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang
 yelped. All four of them stared 
at the window beside the doorway. The shadow of somebody small 
and squat rippled across the thin curtain. 
“
It’s her
!” Ron whispered. 
“Get under here!” Harry said quickl
y; seizing the Invisibility Cloak 
he whirled it over himself and He
rmione while Ron tore around the 
table and dived beneath the cloak 
as well. Huddled together they 
backed away into a corner. Fang 
was barking madly 
at the door. Ha-
grid looked thoroughly confused. 
"“Hagrid, hide our mugs!” "
Hagrid seized Harry’s and Ron’s mugs and shoved them under 
the cushion in Fang’s basket. Fang
 was now leaping up at the door; 
Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open. 
Professor Umbridge was standi
ng in the doorwa
y wearing her 
   435 green tweed cloak and a matching hat 
"with earflaps. Lips pursed, she "
leaned back so as to see Hagrid’s face; she barely reached his navel. 
“
"So,"
"” she said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody "
deaf. “You’re Ha
"grid, are you?” "
"Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room, her "
bulging eyes ro
lling in every direction. 
"“Get away,” she snapped, waving"
" her handbag at Fang, who had "
bounded up to her and was at
tempting to lick her face. 
"“Er — I don’ want ter be rude,” sa"
"id Hagrid, staring at her, “but "
who the ruddy hell are you?” 
“My name is Dolores Umbridge.” 
Her eyes were sweeping the cabin. 
Twice they stared directly into 
"the corner where Harry stood, sa"
ndwiched between Ron and Her-
mione. 
“Dolores Umbridge?” Hagrid said
", sounding thoroughly confused. "
“I thought you were one o’ them
 Ministry — don’ you work with 
Fudge?” 
“I was Senior Undersecretary to th
"e Minister, yes,” said Umbridge, "
"now pacing around the cabin, taking "
"in every tiny detail within, from "
the haversack against the wall to th
e abandoned traveling cloak. “I am 
now the Defense Against th
e Dark Arts teacher —” 
"“Tha’s brave of yeh,” said Hagrid, "
“there’s not many’d take tha’ job 
anymore —” 
"“— and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,” said Umbridge, giving no sign "
that she had heard him. 
"“Wha’s that?” said Hagrid, frowning. "
"“Precisely what I was going to ask,"
"” said Umbridge, pointing at the "
broken shards of china on the floor
 that had been Hermione’s mug. 
"“Oh,” said Hagrid, with a most un"
helpful glance toward the corner 
"where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood "
"hidden, “oh, tha’ was . . . was "
Fang. He broke a mug. So I ha
d ter use this one instead.” 
Hagrid pointed to the mug from 
"which he had been drinking, one "
 436 hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye. Umbridge 
"stood facing him now, taking in eve"
ry detail of his appearance instead 
of the cabin’s. 
"“I heard voices,” she said quietly. "
"“I was talkin’ ter Fang,” said Hagrid stoutly. "
“And was he talking back to you?” 
"“Well . . . in a manner o’ speakin’,” said Hagrid, looking uncom-"
fortable. “I sometimes say Fa
ng’s near enough human —” 
“There are three sets of footprints
 in the snow leading from the cas-
"tle doors to your cabin,"
” said Umbridge sleekly. 
Hermione gasped; Harry clapped a 
"hand over her mouth. Luckily, "
Fang was sniffing loudly around 
the hem of Professor Umbridge’s 
"robes, and she did not ap"
pear to have heard. 
"“Well, I on’y jus’ got back,” said"
" Hagrid, waving an enormous hand "
at the haversack. “Maybe someone 
came ter call earlier an’ I missed 
em. 
“There are no footst
eps leading away from
 your cabin door.” 
"“Well I . . . I don’ know why that’d be. . . .” said Hagrid, tugging "
nervously at his beard and again glancing toward the corner where 
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood,"
 as though asking for help. 
“Erm . . .” 
Umbridge wheeled around and str
"ode the length of the cabin, "
looking around carefully. She bent
 and peered under the bed. She 
opened Hagrid’s cupboards. She passed within two inches of where 
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood pressed against the wall; Harry ac-"
tually pulled in his stomach as she walked by. After looking carefully 
inside the enormous ca
uldron Hagrid used for cooking she wheeled 
"around again and said, “What ha"
s happened to you? How did you 
sustain those injuries?” 
"Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face, which in "
"Harry’s opinion was a mistake, becaus"
e the black-and-purple bruising  
   437 all around his eye was now clearly 
"visible, not to "
mention the large 
amount of fresh and congealed blood 
"on his face. “Oh, I . . . had a bit "
"of an accident,” he said lamely. "
“What sort of accident?” 
“I-I tripped.” 
"“You tripped,” she repeated coolly. "
"“Yeah, tha’s right. Over"
 . . . over a friends 
"broomstick. I don’ fly, "
"meself. Well, look at the size o’ "
"me, I don’ reckon there’s a broomstick "
"that’d hold me. Friend o’ mine breeds Abraxan horses, I dunno if "
"you’ve ever seen ’em, big beasts, wi"
"nged, yeh know, I’ve had a bit of a "
ride on one o’ them an’ it was —” 
"“Where have you been?” asked Umbridge, cutting coolly through "
Hagrid’s babbling. 
“Where’ve I . . . ?” 
"“Been, yes,” she said. “Term starte"
d more than two months ago. 
Another teacher has had to cover your
 classes. None of your colleagues 
has been able to give me any inform
ation as to your whereabouts. You 
left no address. Where have you been?” 
There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her with his newly un-
covered eye. Harry could almost he
ar his brain working furiously. 
"“I — I’ve been away for me health,” he said. "
"“For your health,” said Umbridge. "
Her eyes traveled over Hagrid’s 
discolored and swollen face; drag
on blood dripped gently onto his 
waistcoat in the silence. “I see.” 
"“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “bit o’ — o’ fresh air, yeh know —” "
"“Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be"
" so difficult to come by,” said "
Umbridge sweetly. The small patch of Hagrid’s face that was not black 
or purple flushed. 
"“Well — change o’ scene, yeh know —” "
“Mountain scenery?” said Umbridge swiftly. 
"She knows,"
 Harry thought desperately. 
 438 "“Mountains?” Hagrid repeated, clea"
"rly thinking fast. “Nope, South "
of France fer me. Bit o’
 sun an’ . . . an’ sea.” 
“Really?” said Umbridge. “You 
don’t have much
 of a tan.” 
"“Yeah . . . well . . . sensitive skin,”"
" said Hagrid, attempting an in-"
gratiating smile. Harry noticed that
 two of his teeth had been knocked 
out. Umbridge looked at him coldly; his smile faltered. Then she 
hoisted her handbag a little higher in
"to the crook of her arm and said, "
"“I shall, of course, be informing th"
e Minister of your
 late return.” 
"“Righ’,” said Hagrid, nodding. "
“You ought to know too that as Hi
gh Inquisitor it is my unfortu-
nate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers. So I daresay we 
shall meet again 
soon enough.” 
She turned sharply and ma
rched back to the door. 
“You’re inspectin’ us?” Hagrid ec
"hoed blankly, looking after her. "
"“Oh yes,” said Umbridge softly, lo"
oking back at him with her hand 
on the door handle. “The Ministry 
is determined to weed out unsat-
"isfactory teachers, "
Hagrid. Good night.” 
"She left, closing the door behind "
her with a snap. Harry made to 
pull off the Invisibility Cloak 
but Hermione seiz
ed his wrist. 
"“Not yet,” she breathed in his ear. “She might not be gone yet.” "
Hagrid seemed to be thinking th
e same way; he 
stumped across the 
room and pulled back the 
curtain an inch or so. 
"“She’s goin’ back ter the castle,” he"
 said in a low voice. “Blimey . . . 
"inspectin’ people, is she?” "
"“Yeah,” said Harry, pulling the cloa"
k off. “Trelawney’s on probation 
already. . . .” 
“Um . . . what sort of thing are you 
"planning to do with us in class, "
Hagrid?” asked Hermione. 
"“Oh, don’ you worry abou’ that, I’ve"
 got a great lo
ad o’ lessons 
"planned,” said Hagrid enthusiastica"
"lly, scooping up his dragon steak "
from the table and slapping it over his eye again. “I’ve bin keepin’ a  
   439 "couple o’ creatures saved fer yer O.W.L. year, you wait, they’re some-"
thin’ really special.” 
“Erm . . . special in what way?
” asked Hermione tentatively. 
"“I’m not sayin’,” said Hagrid ha"
ppily. “I don’ want ter spoil the 
surprise.” 
"“Look, Hagrid,” said Hermione ur"
"gently, dropping all pretense, "
“Professor Umbridge won’t be at a
ll happy if you bring anything to 
class that’s too dangerous —” 
"“Dangerous?” said Hagrid, lookin"
g genially bemused. “Don’ be 
"silly, I wouldn’ give yeh anythin’ dang"
"erous! I mean, all righ’, they can "
look after themselves —” 
"“Hagrid, you’ve got to pass Umbridge’s inspection, and to do that "
it would really be better if she sa
w you teaching us how to look after 
"porlocks, how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs, "
stuff like that!” said
 Hermione earnestly. 
"“But tha’s not very interestin’, He"
"rmione,” said Hagrid. “The stuff "
"I’ve got’s much more impressive, I’ve bin bringin’ ’em on fer years, I "
reckon I’ve got the on’y domestic herd in Britain —” 
“Hagrid . . . please . . 
".” said Hermione, a note of real desperation "
in her voice. “Umbridge is looking 
for any excuse to get rid of teach-
ers she thinks are too close to Du
"mbledore. Please, Hagrid, teach us "
something dull that’s bound to 
come up in our 
O.W.L. . . .” 
But Hagrid merely yawned widely
 and cast a one-eyed look of 
longing toward the vast bed in the corner. 
"“Lis’en, it’s bin a long day an’ it’s"
" late,” he said, patting Hermione "
"gently on the shoulder, so that her knees gave way and hit the floor "
with a thud. “Oh — sorry —” He pulle
d her back up by the neck of 
"her robes. “Look, don’ you go worryi"
"n’ abou’ me, I promise yeh I’ve "
got really good stuff planned fer ye
r lessons now I’m back. . . . Now 
you lot had better get back up to 
"the castle, an’ don’ forget ter wipe "
yer footprints out behind yeh!” 
 440 “I dunno if you got through to hi
"m,” said Ron a short while later "
"when, having checked that"
" the coast was clear, they walked back up to "
the castle through the 
"thickening snow, leaving no trace behind them "
due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they 
went. 
"“Then I’ll go back again tomorrow,” said Hermione determinedly. "
“I’ll plan his lessons for 
him if I have to. I don’t care if she throws out 
Trelawney but she’s no
t taking Hagrid!” 
Hermione plowed her way back to
 Hagrid’s cabin through two 
feet of snow on Sunday morning. Harry and Ron wanted to 
"go with her, but their mountain "
of homework had reached an alarm-
"ing height again, so th"
"ey grudgingly remained in the common room, "
trying to ignore the gleeful shouts
 drifting up from the grounds out-
"side, where students were enjoying themselves skating on the frozen "
"lake, tobogganing, and worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up "
to Gryffindor Tower and ra
p hard on the windows. 
"“Oy!” bellowed Ron, finally losing "
patience and sticking his head 
"out of the window, “I am a prefect an"
d if one more snowball hits this 
window — OUCH!” 
"He withdrew his head sharply,"
 his face covered in snow. 
"“It’s Fred and George,” he said "
"bitterly, slamming the window be-"
hind him. “Gits . . .” 
Hermione returned from Hagrid’s
" just before lunch, shivering "
"slightly, her robes damp to the knees. "
"“So?” said Ron, looking up when she entered. “Got all his lessons "
planned for him?” 
H 
 442 "“Well, I tried,” she said dully, sink"
ing into a chair beside Harry. She 
pulled out her wand and gave it a complicated little wave so that hot 
"air streamed out of the tip; she then pointed this at her robes, which "
began to steam as they dried out.
 “He wasn’t even there when I ar-
"rived, I was knocking for at least half an hour. And then he came "
stumping out of the forest —” 
Harry groaned. The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of 
creatures most likely to get Hagrid
 the sack. “What’s he keeping in 
there? Did he say?” asked Harry. 
"“No,” said Hermione miserably. “H"
e says he wants them to be a 
surprise. I tried to explain about Um
"bridge, but he just doesn’t get it. "
He kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study knarls 
than chimaeras — oh I don’t think he’s 
got
" a chimaera,” she added at "
the appalled look on Harry and Ron’s fa
"ces, “but that’s not for lack of "
trying from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs. . . . I don’t 
know how many times I told him
 he’d be bette
r off following 
"Grubbly-Plank’s plan, I honestly don’t think he listened to half of "
"what I said. He’s in a bit of a funny mood, you know. He still won’t "
say how he got all th
ose injuries. . . .” 
Hagrid’s reappearance at the sta
ff table at breakfast next day was 
not greeted by enthusiasm from all 
"students. Some, like Fred, George, "
"and Lee, roared with delight and "
sprinted up the 
aisle between the 
Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables 
to wring Hagrid’s enormous hand; 
"others, like Parvati and Lavender"
", exchanged gloomy "
looks and shook 
their heads. Harry knew that many
 of them preferred Professor 
"Grubbly-Plank’s lessons, and the worst "
"of it was that a very small, un-"
biased part of him knew that th
ey had good reason: Grubbly-Plank’s 
idea of an interesting class was no
t one where there was a risk that 
somebody might have th
eir head ripped off. 
It was with a certain amount of 
"apprehension that Harry, Ron, and "
"Hermione headed down to Hagrid’s on Tuesday, heavily muffled "
against the cold. Harry was worrie
"d, not only about what Hagrid "
   443 might have decided to te
"ach them, but also about how the rest of the "
"class, particularly Malfoy and his "
"cronies, would behave if Umbridge "
was watching them. 
"However, the High Inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they strug-"
gled through the snow toward Hagr
"id, who stood waiting for them on "
the edge of the forest. He did not present a reassuring sight; the 
bruises that had been purple on Satu
rday night were now tinged with 
green and yellow and some of his cuts
 still seemed to be bleeding. 
Harry could not understand this: Ha
d Hagrid perhaps been attacked 
by some creature whose venom prevent
ed the wounds it inflicted from 
"healing? As though to complete the ominous picture, Hagrid was "
carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder. 
“We’re workin’ in here today!” Ha
grid called happily to the ap-
"proaching students, jerking his head"
 back at the dark trees behind 
him. “Bit more sheltered! Anyway
", they prefer the dark. . . .” "
“What prefers the dark?” Harry 
heard Malfoy say sharply to 
"Crabbe and Goyle, a trace of pani"
c in his voice. “What did he say 
prefers the dark — did you hear?” 
Harry remembered the only occasion
 on which Malfoy had entered 
the forest before now; he had 
not been very brave then either. He 
smiled to himself; after the Quidditch match anything that caused 
Malfoy discomfort was 
all right with him. 
"“Ready?” said Hagrid happily, look"
"ing around at the class. “Right, "
"well, I’ve bin savin’ a trip inter th"
e forest fer yer fifth year. Thought 
we’d go an’ see these creatures in 
"their natural habitat. Now, what "
"we’re studyin’ today is pretty rare, "
I reckon I’m probably the on’y per-
son in Britain who’s ma
naged ter train ’em —” 
"“And you’re sure they’re trained, ar"
"e you?” said Malfoy, the panic in "
his voice even more pronounced now.
 “Only it wouldn’t be the first 
time you’d brought wild st
"uff to class, would it?” "
The Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked 
as though they thought Malf
oy had a fair point too. 
 444 "“’Course they’re trained,” said Hagrid, scowling and hoisting the "
dead cow a little highe
r on his shoulder. 
“So what happened to your fa
"ce, then?” demanded Malfoy. "
“Mind yer own business!” said Hagrid
", angrily. “Now if yeh’ve fin-"
"ished askin’ stupid questions, follow me!” "
He turned and strode straight into the forest. Nobody seemed 
"much disposed to follow. Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who "
"sighed but nodded, and the three of "
"them set off after Hagrid, leading "
the rest of the class. 
They walked for about ten minu
tes until they reached a place 
where the trees stood so closely together
 that it was as dark as twilight 
and there was no snow on the ground 
at all. Hagrid deposited his half 
"a cow with a grunt on the ground, "
"stepped back, and turned to face "
"his class again, most of whom were creeping toward him from tree to "
"tree, peering around nervously as th"
ough expecting to be set upon at 
any moment. 
"“Gather roun’, gather roun’,” said Hagrid encouragingly. “Now, "
they’ll be attracted by the smell o’ 
the meat but I’m goin’ ter give ’em 
"a call anyway, ’cause they’ll like ter know it’s me. . . .” "
"He turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face, "
"and gave an odd, shrieking cry that "
echoed through the dark trees like 
the call of some monstrous bird. 
Nobody laughed; most of them 
looked too scared to make a sound. 
Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again. A minute passed in which the 
class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around 
trees for a first glimpse of whatever
" it was that was coming. And then, "
as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enor-
"mous chest, Harry nudged Ron and "
pointed into the black space be-
tween two gnarled yew trees. 
"A pair of blank, white, shining "
eyes were growing larger through 
the gloom and a moment later the 
"dragonish face, neck, and then "
"skeletal body of a great, black, "
winged horse emerged from the dark-
   445 "ness. It looked around at the class for a few seconds, swishing its long "
"black tail, then bowed its head and be"
gan to tear flesh from the dead 
cow with its pointed fangs. 
A great wave of relief broke over Ha
rry. Here at last was proof that 
"he had not imagined these creatures, "
that they were real: Hagrid knew 
about them too. He looked eagerly 
"at Ron, but Ron was still staring "
"around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, “Why "
doesn’t Hagrid call again?” 
Most of the rest of the class we
re wearing expressions as confused 
and nervously expectant as Ron’s and 
were still gazing everywhere but 
at the horse standing feet from th
em. There were only two other peo-
ple who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing 
just behind Goyle was watching the hors
e eating with an expression of 
"great distaste on his face, and Neville, whose eyes were following the "
swishing progress of 
the long black tail. 
"“Oh, an’ here comes another one!” sa"
"id Hagrid proudly, as a second "
black horse appeared out of the da
"rk trees, folded its leathery wings "
"closer to its body, and dipped its head to gorge on the meat. “Now . . . "
"put yer hands up, "
who can see ’em?” 
Immensely pleased to feel that he wa
s at last going to understand the 
"mystery of these horses, Harry raised"
 his hand. Hagrid nodded at him. 
"“Yeah . . . yeah, I knew you’d be able"
" ter, Harry,” he said seriously. "
"“An’ you too, Neville, eh? An’ —” "
"“Excuse me,” said Malfoy"
" in a sneering voice, "
“but what exactly are 
we supposed to be seeing?” 
"For answer, Hagrid pointed at th"
e cow carcass on the ground. The 
whole class stared at it for a few 
"seconds, then several people gasped "
and Parvati squealed. Harry underst
ood why: Bits of flesh stripping 
themselves away from the bones an
d vanishing into thin air had to 
look very odd indeed. 
“What’s doing it?” Parvati demanded 
in a terrified vo
"ice, retreating "
behind the nearest tree. “What’s eating it?” 
 446 "“Thestrals,” said Hagrid proudly and Hermione gave a soft “oh!” of "
comprehension at Harry’s shoulder
. “Hogwarts has got a whole herd 
"of ’em in here. Now, who knows — ?” "
"“But they’re really, really unlucky!” interrupted Parvati, looking "
alarmed. “They’re supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune 
on people who see them. Professor Trelawney told me once —” 
"“No, no, no,” said Hagrid, chucklin"
"g, “tha’s jus’ superstition, that "
"is, they aren’ unlucky, they’re dead "
"clever an’ useful! ’Course, this lot "
"don’ get a lot o’ work, it’s mainly ju"
s’ pullin’ the school carriages un-
less Dumbledore’s takin’ a long jour
ney an’ don’ want ter Apparate — 
"an’ here’s another couple, look —” "
"Two more horses came quietly out of the trees, one of them passing "
"very close to Parvati, wh"
o shivered and pressed 
herself closer to the 
"tree, saying, “I think I felt something, I think it’s near me!” "
"“Don’ worry, it won’ hurt yeh,” sa"
"id Hagrid patiently. “Righ’, now, "
who can tell me why some o’ you can see them an’ some can’t?” 
Hermione raised her hand. 
"“Go on then,” said Hagrid, beaming at her. "
“The only people who can see thes
"trals,” she said, “are people who "
have seen death.” 
"“Tha’s exactly right,” said Hagrid"
" solemnly, “ten po"
ints ter Gryffin-
"dor. Now, thestrals —” "
“
"Hem, hem."
” 
Professor Umbridge had arrived. 
She was standing a few feet away 
"from Harry, wearing her green hat and cloak again, her clipboard at "
"the ready. Hagrid, who had never heard Umbridge’s fake cough be-"
"fore, was gazing in some concern at the closest thestral, evidently un-"
der the impression that 
it had made the sound. 
“
"Hem, hem."
” 
"“Oh hello!” Hagrid said, smiling, "
having located the source of the 
noise. 
“You received the note I sent to
 your cabin this morning?” said 
   447 "Umbridge, in the same loud, slow vo"
"ice she had used with him earlier, "
as though she was addressing some
body both foreign and very slow. 
“Telling you that I would be
 inspecting your lesson?” 
"“Oh yeah,” said Hagrid brightly"
. “Glad yeh found the place all 
"righ’! Well, as you can see — or"
", I dunno — can you? We’re doin’ "
thestrals today —” 
“I’m sorry?” said Umbridge loudly
", cupping her hand around her "
ear and frowning. “What did you say?” 
Hagrid looked a little confused. 
“Er — 
thestrals
"!” he said loudly. “Big — er — winged horses, yeh "
know!” 
He flapped his gigantic arms hopefully. Professor Umbridge raised 
"her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on her clipboard, "
“‘
has . . . to . . . resort . . . to 
. . . crude . . . sign . . . language
 . . .’” 
“Well . . . anyway . . .” said Hagr
"id, turning back to the class and "
looking slightly flustered. “E
rm . . . what was I sayin’?” 
“‘
Appears . . . to . . . have . . . poor
 . . . short . . . term . . . memory
 . . .’” 
"muttered Umbridge, loudly enough for everyone to hear her. Draco "
Malfoy looked as though Christma
s had come a month early; Hermi-
"one, on the other hand"
", had turned scarlet wi"
th suppressed rage. 
"“Oh yeah,” said Hagrid, throwing "
an uneasy glance at Umbridge’s 
"clipboard, but plowing on valiantly."
" “Yeah, I was gonna tell yeh how "
"come we got a herd. Yeah, so, we started off with a male an’ five fe-"
"males. This one,” he patted the firs"
"t horse to have appeared, “name o’ "
"Tenebrus, he’s my special favorite, fi"
rs’ one born here in the forest —” 
"“Are you aware,” Umbridge said lo"
"udly, interrupting him, “that the "
Ministry of Magic has classified thestrals as ‘dangerous’?” 
"Harry’s heart sank like a stone,"
 but Hagrid merely chuckled. 
“Thestrals aren’ dangerous! All ri
"gh, they might take a bite outta "
you if yeh really annoy them —” 
“‘
Shows . . . signs . . . of . . . pleasure . . . at . . . idea . . . of . . . vio-
lence
" . . . ’” muttered Umbridge, sc"
ribbling on her clipboard again. 
 448 "“No — come on!” said Hagrid, l"
ooking a little anxious now. “I 
"mean, a dog’ll bite if yeh bait it, wo"
n’ it — but thestrals have jus’ got 
a bad reputation because o’ the death thing — people used ter think 
"they were bad omens, didn’ they? Ju"
"s’ didn’ understand, did they?” "
"Umbridge did not answer; she finished writing her last note, then "
"looked up at Hagrid and said, ag"
"ain very loudly and slowly, “Please "
continue teaching as usual. I am
 going to walk” — she mimed walk-
ing — Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson were
 having silent fits of laughter 
— “among the students” — she pointed around at individual mem-
bers of the class — “and ask them questions.” She pointed at her 
mouth to indicate talking. 
"Hagrid stared at her, clearly at a complete loss to understand why "
she was acting as though he did 
not understand normal English. 
Hermione had tear
s of fury in her eyes now. 
"“You hag, you evil hag!” she whis"
"pered, as Umbridge walked to-"
ward Pansy Parkinson. “I
 know what you’re doing
", you awful, twisted, "
vicious —” 
"“Erm . . . anyway,” said Hagrid, "
clearly struggling to regain the 
"flow of his lesson, “so — thestrals. Yeah. Well, there’s loads o’ good "
stuff abou’ them. . . .” 
"“Do you find,” said Professor Umbr"
idge in a ringing voice to Pansy 
"Parkinson, “that you are able to un"
derstand Professor Hagrid when he 
talks?” 
"Just like Hermione, Pansy had tears "
"in her eyes, but these were tears "
"of laughter; indeed, her answer was "
almost incoherent because she was 
trying to suppress her giggl
es. “No . . . because . . 
. well . . . it sounds 
. . . like grunting a lo
t of the time. . . .” 
Umbridge scribbled on her clipbo
ard. The few unbruised bits of 
"Hagrid’s face flushed, but he tried to act as though he had not heard "
Pansy’s answer.

"loudly, and Pansy Parkinson collapsed "
in a fit of renewed giggles. Pro-
fessor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to 
Neville. 
"“You can see the thestrals, Lo"
"ngbottom, can you?” she said. "
Neville nodded. 
“Whom did you see die?” she as
"ked, her tone indifferent. "
“My . . . my granda
"d,” said Neville. "
“And what do you think of them?”
" she said, waving her stubby "
"hand at the horses, who by now had stripped a great deal of the car-"
cass down to bone. 
"“Erm,” said Neville nervously, wi"
th a glance at 
"Hagrid. “Well, "
they’re . . . er . . . okay. . . .” 
“‘
Students . . . are . . . too . . . intimi
dated . . . to . . . admit . . . they 
. . . are . . . frightened.
" . . .’” muttered Umbridge, making another "
note on her clipboard. 
"“No!” said Neville, looking upset, “n"
"o, I’m not scared of them — !” "
"“It’s quite all right,” said Umbrid"
"ge, patting Neville on the shoul-"
der with what she evidently intended
" to be an understanding smile, "
though it looked more like a leer 
"to Harry. “Well, Hagrid,” she turned "
"to look up at him again, speaking once more in that loud, slow voice, "
“I think I’ve got enough to be ge
tting along with. . 
. . You will re-
ceive” — she mimed taking somethin
g from the air in front of her — 
“the results of your inspection” — she pointed at the clipboard — “in 
ten days’ time.” She held up ten stub
"by little fingers, then, her smile "
wider and more toadlike than ever
" before beneath her green hat, she "
"bustled from their midst, leaving Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson in fits "
"of laughter, Hermione actually shak"
"ing with fury, and Neville looking "
confused and upset. 
 450 "“That foul, lying, twisting old gargoyle!” stormed Hermione half "
"an hour later, as they made their wa"
y back up to the castle through the 
channels they had made earlier in the snow. “You see what she’s up to? 
It’s her thing about half-breeds all 
over again — she’s trying to make 
out Hagrid’s some kind of dim-witte
"d troll, just because he had a gi-"
"antess for a mother — and oh, it’s not "
"fair, that really wasn’t a bad les-"
"son at all — I mean, all right, if"
 it had been Blast-Ended Skrewts 
"again, but thestrals are fine — in fa"
"ct, for Hagrid, they’re really good!” "
"“Umbridge said they’re dangerous,” said Ron. "
"“Well, it’s like Hagrid said, they"
 can look after th
"emselves,” said "
"Hermione impatiently, “and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank "
"wouldn’t usually show them to us before N.E.W.T. level, but, well, "
they 
are
" very interesting, aren’t they? "
The way some people can see 
them and some can’t!
 I wish I could.” 
“Do you?” Harry as
ked her quietly. 
She looked horrorstruck. 
"“Oh Harry — I’m sorry — no, of co"
urse I don’t — that was a re-
ally stupid thing to say —” 
"“It’s okay,” he said quickly, “don’t worry. . . .” "
“I’m surprised so many people 
could
" see them,” said Ron. “Three in "
a class —” 
"“Yeah, Weasley, we were just wondering,” said a malicious voice "
nearby. Unheard by any of them
" in the muffling snow, Malfoy, "
"Crabbe, and Goyle were walking al"
ong right behind them. “D’you 
reckon if you saw someone snuff it 
you’d be able to see the Quaffle 
better?” 
"He, Crabbe, and Goyle roared with la"
ughter as they pushed past on 
their way to the castle and then brok
e into a chorus of “Weasley Is 
Our King.” Ron’s ears
 turned scarlet. 
"“Ignore them, just ignore them,”"
" intoned Hermione, pulling out "
her wand and performing the charm to
 produce hot air ag
"ain, so that  "
   451 she could melt them an easier pa
th through the untouched snow be-
tween them and the greenhouses. 
"December arrived, bringing with"
 it more snow and a positive 
avalanche of homework for the fifth years. Ron and Hermione’s pre-
fect duties also became more an
d more onerous as Christmas ap-
proached. They were called upon to
 supervise the decoration of the 
castle (“You try putting up tinsel
 when Peeves has got the other end 
and is trying to strangle you with 
"it,” said Ron), to watch over first "
and second years spending their brea
k times inside because of the bit-
ter cold (“And they’re cheeky little 
"snotrags, you know, we definitely "
"weren’t that rude when we were in first year,” said Ron), and to patrol "
the corridors in shifts with Argus Fi
"lch, who suspected that the holi-"
day spirit might show itself in an 
outbreak of wizard duels (“He’s got 
"dung for brains, that one,” said Ron "
furiously). They were so busy that 
Hermione had stopped knit
ting elf hats and was fretting that she was 
down to her last three. 
“All those poor elves I haven’t set fr
"ee yet, having to stay over dur-"
ing Christmas because ther
e aren’t enough hats!” 
"Harry, who had not had the heart to "
tell her that Dobby was taking 
"everything she made, bent lower over"
 his History of Magic essay. In 
"any case, he did not want to think "
about Christmas. Fo
r the first time 
"in his school career, he very much "
wanted to spend the holidays away 
from Hogwarts. Between his Qui
dditch ban and worry about whether 
or not Hagrid was going to be put on
" probation, he felt highly resent-"
ful toward the place at the moment. 
The only thing he really looked 
"forward to were the D.A. meetings, "
and they would have to stop over 
"the holidays, as nearly everybody "
in the D.A. would be spending the 
time with their families. Hermione 
"was going skiing with her parents, "
"something that greatly amused Ron,"
 who had never before heard of 
Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood to their feet to slide down  
 452 "mountains. Ron, meanwhile, was "
going home to the Burrow. Harry 
endured several days of jealousy befo
"re Ron said, in response to Harry "
asking how Ron was going to get ho
"me for Christmas, “But you’re "
coming too! Didn’t I say?
 Mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks 
ago! 
"Hermione rolled her eyes, but Harry’s spirits soared: The thought "
"of Christmas at the Burrow was truly wonderful, only slightly marred "
by Harry’s guilty feeling that he wo
uld not be able to spend the holi-
day with Sirius. He wondered wh
ether he could possibly persuade 
"Mrs. Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities too, but apart "
from the fact that he doubted wh
ether Dumbledore would permit Sir-
"ius to leave Grimmauld Place, he could not help but feel that Mrs. "
Weasley might not want him; they 
were so often at loggerheads. Sir-
ius had not contacted Harry at all sinc
"e his last appearance in the fire, "
and although Harry knew that with 
Umbridge on the constant watch 
it would be unwise to attempt to co
"ntact him, he did not like to think "
of Sirius alone in his mother’s ol
"d house, perhaps pulling a lonely "
cracker with Kreacher. 
Harry arrived early in 
the Room of Requirem
ent for the last D.A. 
meeting before the holidays and wa
"s very glad he had, because when "
the lamps burst into light he saw 
that Dobby had taken it upon him-
self to decorate the place for Christ
mas. He could tell
 the elf had done 
"it, because nobody else would have"
 strung a hundred golden baubles 
"from the ceiling, each showing a "
picture of Harry’s 
face and bearing 
the legend HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS! 
Harry had only just managed to ge
t the last of them down before 
the door creaked open 
and Luna Lovegood ente
"red, looking dreamy "
as always. 
"“Hello,” she said vaguely, looking "
around at what remained of the 
"decorations. “These are nice, did you put them up?” "
"“No,” said Harry, “it wa"
s Dobby the house-elf.” 
   453 "“Mistletoe,” said Luna dreamily, po"
inting at a larg
e clump of white 
berries placed almost over Harry’s head. He jumped out from under 
"it. “Good thinking,” said Luna very "
seriously. “It’s often infested with 
nargles.” 
Harry was saved the necessity of as
king what nargles were by the 
"arrival of Angelina, Katie, and Alicia. All three of them were breath-"
less and looked very cold. 
"“Well,” said Angelina dully, pullin"
g off her cloak and throwing it 
"into a corner, “we’ve replaced you.” "
“Replaced me?” said
 Harry blankly. 
"“You and Fred and George,” she "
said impatiently. “We’ve got an-
other Seeker!” 
“Who?” said Harry quickly. 
"“Ginny Weasley,” said Katie. "
Harry gaped at her. 
"“Yeah, I know,” said Angelina, pulling out her wand and flexing her "
"arm. “But she’s pretty good, actually"
". Nothing on you, of course,” she "
"said, throwing him a very dirty look, "
“but as we can’t have you . . .” 
Harry bit back the retort
 he was longing to ut
ter: Did she imagine 
for a second that he did not regret
 his expulsion from the team a hun-
dred times more than she did? 
“And what about the Beaters?” he 
"asked, trying to keep his voice "
even. 
"“Andrew Kirke,” said Alicia without enthusiasm, “and Jack Sloper. "
"Neither of them are brilliant, but co"
mpared with the rest of the idiots 
who turned up . . .” 
"The arrival of Ron, Hermione, and "
Neville brought this depressing 
"discussion to an end and within five minutes, the room was full "
enough to prevent him seeing Angeli
"na’s burning, reproachful looks. "
"“Okay,” he said, calling "
them all to order. “I thought this evening 
we should just go over the things we’v
"e done so far, because it’s the last  "
 454 meeting before the holidays and th
ere’s no point starting anything 
new right before a three-week break —” 
"“We’re not doing anything new?” said Zacharias Smith, in a dis-"
gruntled whisper loud enough to 
carry through the room. “If I’d 
"known that, I wouldn’t"
 have come. . . .” 
"“We’re all really sorry Harry didn’t tell you, then,” said Fred loudly. "
Several people sniggered. Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the fa-
miliar swooping sensation in his st
"omach, as though he had missed a "
step going downstairs. 
"“We can practice in pairs,” said"
 Harry. “We’ll start with the Im-
"pediment Jinx, just for ten minutes,"
 then we can get out the cushions 
and try Stunning again.” 
They all divided up obediently; 
Harry partnered Neville as usual. 
The room was soon full of intermittent cries of “
Impedimenta
!” People 
"froze for a minute or so, during"
 which their partners would stare 
aimlessly around the room watching
" other pairs at work, then would "
unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx. 
Neville had improved beyond all re
"cognition. After a while, when "
Harry had unfrozen three times in a ro
"w, he had Neville join Ron and "
Hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the 
others. When he passed Cho she beamed
 at him; he resisted the temp-
tation to walk 
past her several more times. 
After ten minutes on the Impediment
" Jinx, they laid out cushions "
all over the floor and started practicing Stunning again. Space was 
really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once; half the 
"group observed the others for a while, then swapped over. Harry felt "
"himself positively swelling with pride as he watched them all. True, "
"Neville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean, at whom he had been "
"aiming, but it was a much closer mi"
"ss than usual, and everybody else "
had made enormo
us progress. 
At the end of an hour
", Harry called a halt. "
   455 "“You’re getting really good,” he "
"said, beaming around at them. "
“When we get back from the holidays
 we can start doing some of the 
big stuff — maybe even Patronuses.” 
There was a murmur of excitement. 
The room began to clear in the 
usual twos and threes; most peop
le wished Harry a Happy Christmas 
"as they went. Feeling cheerful, he "
collected up the cushions with Ron 
and Hermione and stacked them neatl
y away. Ron and Hermione left 
before he did; he hung back a litt
"le, because Cho was still there and he "
was hoping to receive a Me
rry Christmas from her. 
"“No, you go on,” he heard her say to her friend Marietta, and his "
heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his Adam’s 
apple. 
He pretended to be straightening the cushion pile. He was quite 
sure they were alone now and waited
" for her to speak. Instead, he "
heard a hearty sniff. 
He turned and saw Cho standing 
"in the middle of the room, tears "
pouring down her face. 
“Wha — ?” 
He didn’t know what to do. She wa
"s simply standing there, crying "
silently. 
“What’s up?” he said feebly. 
She shook her head and wiped he
r eyes on her sleeve. “I’m — 
"sorry,” she said thickly. “I suppose . . "
. it’s just . . . learning all this 
stuff. . . . It just makes me 
. . . wonder whether . . . if 
he’d
 known it all 
. . . he’d still be
 alive. . . .” 
Harry’s heart sank right back past 
its usual spot and settled some-
where around his navel. He ought to
 have known. She wanted to talk 
about Cedric. 
"“He did know this stuff,” Harry said heavily. “He was really good "
"at it, or he could never have got to the middle of that maze. But if "
Voldemort really wants to kill 
"you, you don’t stand a chance.” "
 456 She hiccuped at the sound of Vo
"ldemort’s name, but stared at "
Harry without flinching. 
“
You 
"survived when you were just a baby,” she said quietly. "
"“Yeah, well,” said Harry wearily, moving toward the door, “I dunno "
"why, nor does anyone else, so it’s nothing to be proud of.” "
"“Oh don’t go!” said Cho, sounding"
 tearful again. “I’m really sorry 
to get all upset like this. . 
. . I didn’t mean to. . . .” 
She hiccuped again. She was very pretty even when her eyes were 
red and puffy. Harry felt thoroughly 
miserable. He’d have been so 
pleased just with a Me
rry Christmas. . . . 
“I know it must be horrible for yo
"u,” she said, mopping her eyes on "
her sleeve again. “Me mentioning 
"Cedric, when you saw him die. . . . "
I suppose you just want to forget about it. . . .” 
Harry did not say anything to this; 
it was quite true
", but he felt "
heartless saying it. 
"“You’re a r-really good teacher, you "
"know,” said Cho, with a watery "
smile. “I’ve never been able 
to Stun anything before.” 
"“Thanks,” said Harry awkwardly. "
They looked at each other for 
a long moment. Ha
rry felt a burning 
"desire to run from the room and, at"
" the same time, a complete inabil-"
ity to move his feet. 
"“Mistletoe,” said Cho quietly, pointi"
ng at the ceiling over his head. 
"“Yeah,” said Harry. His mouth was very dry. “It’s probably full of "
"nargles, though.” "
“What are nargles?” 
"“No idea,” said Harry. She had mo"
ved closer. His brain seemed to 
"have been Stunned. “You’d have to ask Loony. Luna, I mean.” "
Cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh. She 
was even nearer him now. He could have counted the freckles on her 
nose. 
"“I really like you, Harry.” "
   457 He could not think. A tingling se
nsation was spreading throughout 
"him, paralyzing his arms, legs, and brain. "
She was much too close. He could 
see every tear clinging to her 
eyelashes. . . . 
He returned to the common room 
half an hour later to find 
Hermione and Ron in the best seats 
by the fire; nearly everybody else 
had gone to bed. Hermione was writin
g a very long letter; she had al-
ready filled half a roll of parchm
"ent, which was dangling from the "
edge of the table. Ron was lying on 
"the hearthrug, trying to finish his "
Transfiguration homework. 
"“What kept you?” he asked, as "
Harry sank into th
e armchair next 
to Hermione’s. 
Harry did not answer. He was in a state of shock. Half of him 
wanted to tell Ron and Hermione 
"what had just happened, but the "
other half wanted to take the 
secret with him to the grave. 
"“Are you all right, Harry?” Herm"
"ione asked, peering at him over "
the tip of her quill. 
Harry gave a halfhearted shrug. In 
"truth, he didn’t know whether "
he was all right or not. “What’s up?”
" said Ron, hoisting himself up on "
his elbow to get a clearer view 
of Harry. “What’s happened?” 
Harry didn’t quite know how to se
"t about telling them, and still "
wasn’t sure whether he wanted to. 
Just as he had decided not to say 
"anything, Hermione took ma"
tters out of his hands. 
“Is it Cho?” she asked in a businesslike way. “Did she corner you af-
ter the meeting?” 
"Numbly surprised, Harry nodded. Ron sniggered, breaking off "
when Hermione caught his eye. 
“So — er — what did sh
e want?” he asked in a mock casual voice. 
"“She —” Harry began, rather hoar"
sely; he cleared his throat and 
tried again. “S
he — er —” 
 458 “Did you kiss?” asked Hermione briskly. 
Ron sat up so fast that he sent his 
ink bottle flying all over the rug. 
Disregarding this completely he stared avidly at Harry. 
“Well?” he demanded. 
Harry looked from Ron’s expression
 of mingled curiosity and hilar-
ity to Hermione’s slig
"ht frown, and nodded. "
“HA!” 
Ron made a triumphant gesture with
 his fist and went into a rau-
cous peal of laughter that made 
several timid-looking second years 
over beside the window jump. A re
luctant grin spread over Harry’s 
face as he watched Ron rolling ar
ound on the hearthrug. Hermione 
gave Ron a look of deep disgus
t and returned 
to her letter. 
“Well?” Ron said fina
"lly, looking up at Ha"
rry. “How was it?” 
Harry considered for a moment. 
"“Wet,” he said truthfully. "
Ron made a noise that might have 
indicated jubilati
"on or disgust, "
it was hard to tell. 
"“Because she was crying,” "
Harry continued heavily. 
"“Oh,” said Ron, his smile fading "
slightly. “Are you that bad at 
kissing?” 
"“Dunno,” said Harry, who hadn’t "
"considered this, and immediately "
felt rather worrie
d. “Maybe I am.” 
"“Of course you’re not,” said He"
"rmione absently, still scribbling "
away at her letter. 
“How do you know?” said 
Ron in a sharp voice. 
"“Because Cho spends half her time crying these days,” said Her-"
mione vaguely. “She does it at meal
"times, in the loos, all over the "
place.” 
“You’d think a bit of kissing wo
"uld cheer her up,” said Ron, "
grinning. 
"“Ron,” said Hermione in a dignified voice, dipping the point of her  "
   459 "quill into her ink pot, “you are the "
most insensitive wart I have ever 
had the misfortune to meet.” 
“What’s that supposed to mean?” 
said Ron indignantly. “What sort 
of person cries while so
meone’s kissing them?” 
"“Yeah,” said Harry, slightly"
" desperately, “who does?” "
Hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying ex-
pression on her face. 
“Don’t you understand how Cho’s feeling at the moment?” she 
asked. 
"“No,” said Harry and Ron together. "
Hermione sighed and 
laid down her quill. 
"“Well, obviously, she’s feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying. "
Then I expect she’s feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now 
"she likes Harry, and she can’t work "
out who she likes best. Then she’ll 
"be feeling guilty, thinking it’s an "
insult to Cedric’s memory to be kiss-
"ing Harry at all, and she’ll be "
worrying about what everyone else 
might say about her if she starts go
ing out with Harry. And she prob-
ably can’t work out what her feeli
"ngs toward Harry are anyway, be-"
cause he was the one who was with Ce
"dric when Cedric died, so that’s "
"all very mixed up and painful. Oh, "
and she’s afraid she’s going to be 
thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch 
team because she’
s been flying so 
badly.” 
A slightly stunned silence greeted 
"the end of this speech, then Ron "
"said, “One person can’t feel all "
"that at once, th"
ey’d explode.” 
“Just because you’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn’t 
"mean we all have,”"
" said Hermione nastily, pi"
cking up her quill again. 
"“She was the one who started it,” said Harry. “I wouldn’t’ve — she "
just sort of came at me — and next
 thing she’s crying all over me — I 
didn’t know wh
at to do —” 
"“Don’t blame you, mate,” said "
"Ron, looking alarmed at the very "
thought. 
 460 "“You just had to be nice to her,” said Hermione, looking up anx-"
"iously. “You were, weren’t you?” "
"“Well,” said Harry, an unpleasant he"
"at creeping up his face, “I sort "
of — patted her on the back a bit.” 
Hermione looked as though she was restraining herself from rolling 
her eyes with extreme difficulty. 
"“Well, I suppose it could have been worse,” she said. “Are you go-"
ing to see her again?” 
"“I’ll have to, won’t I?” said Ha"
"rry. “We’ve got D.A. meetings, "
haven’t we?” 
“You know what I 
"mean,” said Hermione impatiently. "
Harry said nothing. Hermione’s 
words opened up a whole new 
vista of frightening possibilities. 
He tried to imagine going somewhere 
"with Cho — Hogsmeade, perhaps — and being alone with her for "
"hours at a time. Of course, she wo"
uld have been expe
cting him to ask 
her out after what had just happened. . . . The thought made his 
stomach clench painfully. 
"“Oh well,” said Hermione distantly, "
"buried in her letter once more, "
“you’ll have plenty of opport
unities to ask her. . . .” 
“What if he doesn’t want to as
"k her?” said Ron, who had been "
watching Harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face. 
"“Don’t be silly,” said Hermione vaguely, “Harry’s liked her for ages, "
"haven’t you, Harry?” "
"He did not answer. Yes, he had liked Cho for ages, but whenever he "
had imagined a scene involving the tw
o of them it had 
always featured 
"a Cho who was enjoying herself, as opposed to a Cho who was sob-"
bing uncontrollably 
into his shoulder. 
“Who’re you writing the novel to
" anyway?” Ron asked Hermione, "
trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor. 
Hermione hitched it up out of sight. 
“Viktor.” 
   461 “
Krum
?” 
“How many other Vi
ktors do we know?” 
"Ron said nothing, but looked disg"
runtled. They sat in silence for 
"another twenty minutes, Ron finishing his Transfiguration essay with "
many snorts of impatience and 
"crossings-out, Hermione writing "
steadily to the very end of the parc
"hment, rolling it up carefully and "
"sealing it, and Harry staring into th"
"e fire, wishing more than anything "
that Sirius’s head would appear th
ere and give him some advice about 
girls. But the fire merely crackled
" lower and lower, until the red-hot "
"embers crumbled into ash and, lo"
"oking around, Harry saw that they "
"were, yet again, the last"
 in the common room. 
"“Well, ’night,” said Hermione, ya"
"wning widely, and she set off up "
the girls’ staircase. 
“What does she see in Krum?” Ron demanded as he and Harry 
climbed the boys’ stairs. 
"“Well,” said Harry, considering the ma"
"tter, “I s’pose he’s older, isn’t "
he . . . and he’s an internat
ional Quidditch player. . . .” 
"“Yeah, but apart from that,” said Ron, sounding aggravated. “I "
"mean he’s a grouchy git, isn’t he?” "
"“Bit grouchy, yeah,” said Harry, whose thoughts were still on Cho. "
They pulled off their robes and pu
"t on pajamas in silence; Dean, "
"Seamus, and Neville were already asleep. Harry put his glasses on his "
bedside table and got into bed but 
did not pull the hangings closed 
around his four-poster; instead he st
ared at the patch of starry sky vis-
"ible through the window next to Neville’s bed. If he had known, this "
"time last night, that in twenty-fou"
r hours’ time he would have kissed 
Cho Chang . . . 
"“’Night,” grunted Ron, from"
 somewhere to his right. 
"“’Night,” said Harry. "
Maybe next time . . . if there wa
s a next time . . 
. she’d be a bit 
happier. He ought to have asked her out; she had probably been  
 462 expecting it and was now really angry 
with him . . . or was she lying in 
"bed, still crying abou"
t Cedric? He did not kn

.
Hermione’s explanation had made it 
all seem more complicated rather 
than easier to understand. 
"That’s what they should teach us here, "
"he thought, turning over onto "
"his side, "
how girls’ brains work . . . it’d be more useful than Divination 
anyway. . . .
Neville snuffled in his sleep. An 
owl hooted somewhere out in the 
night. 
Harry dreamed he was back in the D.A. room. Cho was accusing 
him of luring her there under fals
e pretenses; she said that he had 
promised her a hundred and fifty Ch
ocolate Frog cards if she showed 
"up. Harry protested. . . . Cho shouted, “"
Cedric gave me loads of Choco-
"late Frog cards, look"
!” And she pulled out fistfu
ls of cards from inside 
her robes and threw them into th
"e air, and then turned into "
"Hermione, who said, “"
"You did promise her, you know, Harry. . . . I "
think you’d better give her something else instead. . . . How about your 
Firebolt
?” And Harry was protesting that
 he could not give Cho his 
"Firebolt because Umbridge had it, "
and anyway the whole thing was 
"ridiculous, he’d only come to the "
D.A. room to put up some Christ-
mas baubles shaped like
 Dobby’s head. . . . 
The dream changed. . . . 
"His body felt smooth, powerful, an"
d flexible. He was gliding be-
"tween shining metal bars, across dark, "
cold stone. . . . He was flat 
"against the floor, sliding along on his"
" belly. . . . It was dark, yet he "
"could see objects around him shimmering in strange, vibrant colors. "
. . . He was turning his head. . . 
". At first glance, the corridor was "
empty . . . but no . . . a man was si
"tting on the floor ahead, his chin "
"drooping onto his chest,"
 his outline gleaming
 in the dark. . . . 
Harry put out his tongue. . . . He ta
sted the man’s scent on the air. 
. . . He was alive but drowsing . . . 
sitting in front of a door at the end 
of the corridor . . . 
   463 Harry longed to bite the man . . . 
but he must master the impulse. 
. . . He had more import
ant work to do. . . . 
But the man was stirring . . . a silvery cloak fell from his legs as he 
jumped to his feet; and Harry saw his
" vibrant, blurred outline tower-"
"ing above him, saw a wand withdraw"
n from a belt. . . . He had no 
"choice. . . . He reared high from the floor and struck once, twice, "
"three times, plunging his fangs deep"
"ly into the man’s flesh, feeling his "
"ribs splinter beneath his jaws, feel"
ing the warm gush
 of blood. . . . 
The man was yelling in pain . . . th
en he fell silent. . . . He slumped 
backward against the wall. . . . Blood 
was splattering onto the floor. . . . 
His forehead hurt terribly. . . . It
 was aching fit 
to burst. . . . 
“Harry! HARRY!” 
He opened his eyes. Every inch 
of his body was covered in icy 
sweat; his bedcovers were twisted all around him like a straitjacket; he 
felt as though a white-hot poker wa
s being applied to his forehead. 
“
Harry
!” 
Ron was standing over him look
ing extremely frightened. There 
were more figures at the foot of Harry’s bed. He clutched his head in 
his hands; the pain was blinding him
. . . . He rolled right over and 
vomited over the edge of the mattress. 
"“He’s really ill,” said a scared "
voice. “Should we call someone?” 
“Harry! 
Harry
!” 
"He had to tell Ron, it was very im"
portant that he tell him. . . . Tak-
"ing great gulps of air, Harry pushed himself up in bed, willing himself "
"not to throw up again, th"
e pain half-blinding him. 
"“Your dad,” he panted, his chest heaving. “Your dad’s . . . been "
attacked. . . .” 
“What?” said Ron un
comprehendingly. 
"“Your dad! He’s been bitten, "
"it’s serious, there was blood "
everywhere. . . .” 
"“I’m going for help,” said the sa"
"me scared voice, and Harry heard "
footsteps running ou
t of the dormitory. 
 464 "“Harry, mate,” said Ron uncertainly, “you . . . you were just "
dreaming. . . .” 
“No!” said Harry furiously; it was 
crucial that Ron understand. “It 
"wasn’t a dream . . . not an ordinary dream. . . . I was there, I saw it. "
. . . I 
did
 it. . . .” 
He could hear Seamus and Dean muttering but did not care. The 
pain in his forehead was subsiding 
"slightly, though he was still sweat-"
ing and shivering feverishly. He retched again and Ron leapt backward 
out of the way. 
"“Harry, you’re not well,” he said"
 shakily. “Neville’s gone for 
help. . . .” 
"“I’m fine!” Harry choked, wiping"
 his mouth on his pajamas and 
"shaking uncontrollably. “There’s nothing wrong with me, it’s your dad "
you’ve got to worry about — we need 
to find out where he is — he’s 
bleeding like 
mad — I was — it was a 
huge snake. . . .” 
He tried to get out of bed but Ron pushed him back into it; Dean 
and Seamus were still whispering somewhere nearby. Whether one 
"minute passed or ten, Harry did no"
t know; he simply sat there shak-
"ing, feeling the pain recede very sl"
owly from his scar. . . . Then there 
were hurried footsteps coming up 
"the stairs, and he heard Neville’s "
voice again. 
"“Over here, Professor . . .” "
Professor McGonagall came hurrying
 into the dormitory in her tar-
"tan dressing gown, her glasses perche"
d lopsidedly on the bridge of her 
bony nose. 
"“What is it, Potter? Where does it hurt?” "
He had never been so pleased to see her; it was a member of the Or-
"der of the Phoenix he needed now,"
 not someone fussing over him and 
prescribing useless potions. 
"“It’s Ron’s dad,” he said, sitting up"
 again. “He’s been attacked by a 
snake and it’s 
"serious, I saw it happen.” "
   465 "“What do you mean, you saw it happen?” said Professor McGona-"
"gall, her dark eyeb"
rows contracting. 
“I don’t know. . . . I was asleep
 and then I was there. . . .” 
“You mean you 
dreamed this?” 
“No!” said Harry angrily. Would no
ne of them understand? “I was 
"having a dream at first about something completely different, some-"
thing stupid . . . and then this interr
"upted it. It was real, I didn’t imag-"
"ine it, Mr. Weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a "
"gigantic snake, there was a load of blood, he collapsed, someone’s got "
to find out where he is. . . .” 
Professor McGonagall was gazing
 at him through her lopsided 
spectacles as thou
gh horrified at what she was seeing. 
"“I’m not lying, and I’m not mad!” Ha"
"rry told her, his voice rising to "
"a shout. “I tell you,"
 I saw it happen!” 
"“I believe you, Potter,” said Pro"
fessor McGonagall curtly. “Put on 
your dressing-gown — we’re going to see the headmaster.” 
Harry was so relieved that she was taking him seri
ously that he 
"did not hesitate, but jumped out of bed at once, pulled on "
"his dressing gown, an"
d pushed his glasses 
back onto his nose. 
"“Weasley, you ought to come t"
"oo,” said Professor McGonagall. "
They followed Professor McGonagall past the silent figures of 
"Neville, Dean, and Seamus, out of"
" the dormitory, down the spiral "
"stairs into the common room, throug"
"h the portrait hole, and off along "
the Fat Lady’s moonlit corridor. Harry 
felt as though the panic inside 
him might spill over at any moment; 
"he wanted to run, to yell for "
Dumbledore. Mr. Weasley was bleeding as they walked along so se-
"dately, and what if those fangs (H"
arry tried hard no
t to think “my 
fangs”) had been poisonous? They pa
"ssed Mrs. Norris, who turned her "
lamplike eyes upon them and his
"sed faintly, but Professor McGona-"
"gall said, “Shoo!” Mrs. Norris slunk "
"away into the shadows, and in a "
few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the en-
trance to Dumbledore’s office. 
"“Fizzing Whizbee,” said"
 Professor McGonagall. 
H 
   467 The gargoyle sprang to life and leap
t aside; the wall behind it split 
in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continuously up-
ward like a spiral escalator. The 
three of them stepped onto the mov-
"ing stairs; the wall closed behind them with a thud, and they were "
moving upward in tight circles until they reached the highly polished 
oak door with the brass knocke
r shaped like a griffin. 
Though it was now well past midn
"ight, there were voices coming "
"from inside the room, a positive babb"
le of them. It sounded as though 
Dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people. 
Professor McGonagall rapped three 
"times with the griffin knocker, "
and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them 
all off. The door opened of its own 
accord and Professor McGonagall 
led Harry and Ron inside. 
The room was in half darkness; 
the strange silver instruments 
standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emit-
ting puffs of smoke as they usuall
y did. The portraits of old headmas-
ters and headmistresses covering th
e walls were all snoozing in their 
"frames. Behind the door, a magnificent "
red-and-gold bird the size of a 
swan dozed on its perch with
 its head under its wing. 
"“Oh, it’s you, Professor "
McGonagall . . . and . . . 
ah.
” 
Dumbledore was sitting in a high-b
acked chair behind his desk; he 
leaned forward into the 
pool of candlelight illuminating the papers 
laid out before him. He was we
aring a magnificently embroidered 
"purple-and-gold dressing gown over a snowy-white nightshirt, but "
"seemed wide awake, his penetratin"
g light-blue eyes fixed intently 
upon Professor McGonagall. 
"“Professor Dumbledore, Potter has had a . . . well, a nightmare,” "
said Professor McGonaga
ll. “He says . . .” 
"“It wasn’t a nightmare,"
” said Harry quickly. 
"Professor McGonagall looked around at Harry, frowning slightly. "
"“Very well, then, Potter, you te"
ll the headmaster about it.” 
"“I . . . well, I "
was
 asleep. . . .” said Harry 
and even in his terror and 
 468 his desperation to make Dumbledore 
understand he felt slightly irri-
tated that the headmaster was not 
"looking at him, but examining his "
own interlocked fingers. 
“But it wasn’t an ordi
nary dream . . . it was 
real. . . . I saw it happen. . . .” He
" took a deep breath, “Ron’s dad — "
Mr. Weasley — has been atta
cked by a giant snake.” 
The words seemed to reverberate in
" the air after he had said them, "
"slightly ridiculous, even comic. "
There was a pause in which Dumble-
dore leaned back and stared meditati
vely at the ceiling. Ron looked 
"from Harry to Dumbledore, "
white-faced and shocked. 
“How did you see this?” Dumbledor
"e asked quietly, still not look-"
ing at Harry. 
"“Well . . . I don’t know,” said Ha"
"rry, rather angrily — what did it "
"matter? “Inside my head, I suppose —” "
"“You misunderstand me,” said Dumb"
"ledore, still in the same calm "
tone. “I mean . . . can you remember — er — where you were posi-
tioned as you watched this attack happen? Were you perhaps standing 
"beside the victim, or else looking down on the scene from above?” "
This was such a curious question
 that Harry gaped at Dumbledore; 
it was almost as th
ough he knew . . . 
"“I was the snake,” he said. “I saw "
it all from the snake’s point of 
view. . . .” 
Nobody else spoke for a moment
", then Dumbledore, now looking "
"at Ron, who was still whey-faced, sa"
"id in a new and sharper voice, “Is "
Arthur seriou
sly injured?” 
“
"Yes,"
” said Harry emphatically — why 
were they all so slow on the 
"uptake, did they not realize how much a person bled when fangs that "
long pierced their side? And wh
y could Dumbledore not do him the 
courtesy of looking at him? 
"But Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry jumped, and ad-"
dressed one of the old portraits 
hanging very near the ceiling. 
"“Everard?” he said sharply. “And you too, Dilys!” "
A
"sallow-faced wizard with short, black bangs and an elderly witch "
   469 with long silver ringlets in the 
"frame beside him, both of whom "
seemed to have been in the deep
"est of sleeps, opened their eyes "
immediately. 
“You were listening?
” said Dumbledore. 
"The wizard nodded, the wi"
"tch said, “Naturally.” "
“The man has red hair and glasse
"s,” said Dumbledore. “Everard, "
"you will need to raise the alarm, make"
 sure he is found by the right 
people —” 
"Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead "
of emerging in neighboring pict
ures (as usually happened at Hog-
"warts), neither reappeared; one fr"
ame now contained nothing but a 
"backdrop of dark curtain, the ot"
her a handsome leather armchair. 
Harry noticed that many of the ot
her headmasters and mistresses on 
"the walls, though snoring and dr"
"ooling most convincingly, kept "
sneaking peeks at him under thei
"r eyelids, and he suddenly under-"
stood who had been talking 
when they had knocked. 
“Everard and Dilys were two of Ho
"gwarts’s most celebrated Heads,” "
"Dumbledore said, now sweeping arou"
"nd Harry, Ron, and Professor "
McGonagall and approaching the ma
gnificent sleeping bird on his 
perch beside the door. “Their renown 
is such that both
 have portraits 
hanging in other important Wizarding 
institutions. As they are free to 
move between their own portraits th
ey can tell us what may be hap-
pening elsewhere. . . .” 
“But Mr. Weasley could be anywhere!” said Harry. 
"“Please sit down, all three of you,” said Dumbledore, as though "
Harry had not spoken. “Everard and Di
lys may not be back for several 
minutes. . . . Professor McGonaga
"ll, if you could draw up extra "
chairs . . .” 
Professor McGonagall pulled her 
wand from the pocket of her 
dressing gown and waved it; three ch
"airs appeared out of thin air, "
"straight-backed and wooden, quite "
unlike the comfortable chintz 
armchairs that Dumbledore had conj
ured back at Harry’s hearing. 
 470 "Harry sat down, watching Dumbledor"
e over his shoulder. Dumble-
dore was now stroking Fawkes’s plum
ed golden head with one finger. 
The phoenix awoke immediately. He 
stretched his beautiful head high 
"and observed Dumbledore through bright, dark eyes. "
"“We will need,” said Dumbledore"
" very quietly to the bird, “a "
warning.” 
There was a flash of fire 
and the phoenix had gone. 
Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver in-
struments whose function Harry had 
"never known, carried it over to "
"his desk, sat down facing them again, "
and tapped it gently with the tip 
of his wand. 
The instrument tinkled into life 
at once with rhythmic clinking 
noises. Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule sil-
"ver tube at the top. Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow "
"furrowed, and after a few seconds, "
the tiny puffs became a steady 
stream of smoke that thickened and co
iled in the air. . . . A serpent’s 
head grew out of the end of it
", opening its mouth wide. Harry won-"
dered whether the instrument was 
confirming his story: He looked 
"eagerly at Dumbledore for a sign that he was right, but Dumbledore "
did not look up. 
"“Naturally, naturally,” murmured"
 Dumbledore apparently to him-
"self, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of "
surprise. “But in essence divided?” 
Harry could make neithe
r head nor tail of this question. The 
"smoke serpent, however, split itself instantly into two snakes, both "
coiling and undulating in the dark air. With a look of grim satisfaction 
Dumbledore gave the instrument an
other gentle tap with his wand: 
The clinking noise slowed and di
"ed, and the smoke serpents grew "
"faint, became a formle"
"ss haze, and vanished. "
Dumbledore replaced the instrument 
upon its spindly 
little table; 
Harry saw many of the 
old headmasters in th
e portraits follow him 
"with their eyes, then, realizing that Harry was watching them, hastily "
   471 pretend to be sleeping again. Harry 
wanted to ask what the strange sil-
"ver instrument was for, but before"
" he could do so, there was a shout "
from the top of the wall to their ri
ght; the wizard called Everard had 
reappeared in his port
"rait, panting slightly. "
“Dumbledore!” 
“What news?” said Dumbledore at once. 
“I yelled until someone came ru
"nning,” said the wizard, who was "
mopping his brow on the curtain be
"hind him, “said I’d heard some-"
thing moving downstairs — they wer
en’t sure whether to believe me 
but went down to check — you know there are no portraits down 
"there to watch from. Anyway, they ca"
rried him up a few
 minutes later. 
"He doesn’t look good, he’s covere"
"d in blood, I ran along to Elfrida "
Cragg’s portrait to get a g
ood view as they left —” 
"“Good,” said Dumbledore as Ron ma"
"de a convulsive movement, “I "
"take it Dilys will have seen him arrive, then —” "
"And moments later, the silver-rin"
gletted witch had reappeared in 
"her picture too; she sank, coughing, "
"into her armchair and said, “Yes, "
"they’ve taken him to St. Mungo’s, "
Dumbledore. . . . They carried him 
past under my portrait. . 
. . He looks bad. . . .” 
"“Thank you,” said Dumbledore. He looked around at Professor "
McGonagall. 
"“Minerva, I need you to"
 go and wake the othe
r Weasley children.” 
“Of course. . . .” 
Professor McGonagall got up and 
moved swiftly to the door; Harry 
"cast a sideways glance at Ron,"
 who was now look
ing terrified. 
“And Dumbledore — what about Mo
lly?” said Professor McGona-
"gall, pausing at the door. "
“That will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a 
"lookout for anybody approaching,” "
said Dumbledore. “But she may 
already know . . . that exce
llent clock of hers . . .” 
Harry knew Dumbledore was referring
" to the clock that told, not "
"the time, but the whereabouts and co"
nditions of the various Weasley 
 472 "family members, and with a pang he thought that Mr. Weasley’s hand "
"must, even now, be pointing at “morta"
l peril.” But it was very late. . . . 
"Mrs. Weasley was probably asleep, "
not watching the clock. . . . And 
he felt cold as he remembered Mr
s. Weasley’s boggart turning into 
"Mr. Weasley’s lifeless body, his gl"
"asses askew, blood running down his "
face. . . . But Mr. Weasley wasn’t goin
g to die. . . . He couldn’t. . . . 
Dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind Harry and 
Ron. He emerged from it carrying 
"a blackened old kettle, which he "
placed carefully upon his desk. He raised his wand and murmured 
“
Portus
”; for a moment the 
"kettle trembled, glow"
ing with an odd blue 
"light, then it quivered to a rest, as solidly black as ever. "
Dumbledore marched over to anot
"her portrait, this time of a "
clever-looking wizard with a poin
"ted beard, who ha"
d been painted 
wearing the Slytherin colors of gr
een and silver and was apparently 
sleeping so deeply that he could 
not hear Dumbledore’s voice when he 
attempted to rouse him. 
“Phineas. 
Phineas.
” 
And now the subjects of the portraits lining the room were no 
longer pretending to be asleep; they
 were shifting around in their 
"frames, the better to watch what"
 was happening. When the clever-
looking wizard continued to feign 
"sleep, some of them shouted his "
name too. 
“Phineas! 
Phineas
! PHINEAS!” 
He could not pretend any longer; 
he gave a theatrical jerk and 
opened his eyes wide. 
“Did someone call?” 
“I need you to visit your other po
"rtrait again, Phineas,” said Dum-"
bledore. “I’ve got another message.” 
“Visit my other portrait?” said P
"hineas in a reedy voice, giving a "
"long, fake yawn (his eyes traveling around the room and focusing "
"upon Harry). “Oh no, Dumbledore, "
I am too tired tonight. . . .” 
Something about Phinea
s’s voice was familiar to Harry. Where had 
   473 he heard it before? But before he co
"uld think, the portraits on the sur-"
rounding walls broke into a storm of protest. 
"“Insubordination, sir!” roared a co"
"rpulent, red-nosed wizard, bran-"
dishing his fists. “Der
eliction of duty!” 
“We are honor-bound to give servic
e to the present Headmaster of 
Hogwarts!” cried a frail-looking ol
d wizard whom Harry recognized as 
"Dumbledore’s predecessor, Armando "
"Dippet. “Shame on you, Phineas!” "
"“Shall I persuade him, Dumbledore"
"?” called a gimlet-eyed witch, "
raising an unusually thick wand that
 looked not unlike a birch rod. 
"“Oh, very "
"well,” "
"said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing this wand "
"slightly apprehensively, “though he"
 may well have destroyed my pic-
"ture by now, he’s done "
most of the family —” 
“Sirius knows not to destroy your 
"portrait,” said Dumbledore, and "
Harry realized immediately where he had heard Phineas’s voice before: 
issuing from the apparently empt
y frame in his bedroom in Grim-
mauld Place. “You are to give him
 the message that Arthur Weasley 
has been gravely injured 
"and that his wife, chil"
"dren, and Harry Potter "
will be arriving at his house 
shortly. Do you understand?” 
"“Arthur Weasley, injured, wife "
and children and Harry Potter 
"coming to stay,” recited Phineas in"
" a bored voice. “Yes, yes . . . very "
well. . . .” 
He sloped away into the frame of 
the portrait and 
disappeared from 
view at the very moment that th
"e study door opened again. Fred, "
"George, and Ginny were ushered insi"
"de by Professor McGonagall, all "
three of them looking disheveled 
"and shocked, still in their night "
things. 
“Harry — what’s going on?” as
"ked Ginny, who looked frightened. "
“Professor McGonagall says
 you saw Dad hurt —” 
“Your father has been injured in th
e course of his work for the Or-
"der of the Phoenix,” said Dumbledo"
re before Harry could speak. “He 
has been taken to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and In-
juries. I am sending you back to Si
"rius’s house, which is much more "
 474 convenient for the hospital than 
the Burrow. You will meet your 
mother there.” 
"“How’re we going?” asked Fred, "
looking shaken. “Floo powder?” 
"“No,” said Dumbledore, “Floo powder is not safe at the moment, "
the Network is being watched. You wi
ll be taking a Portkey.” He indi-
cated the old kettle lying innocently
 on his desk. “We are just waiting 
for Phineas Nigellus to repo
rt back. . . . I wish to be sure that the coast 
is clear before sending you —” 
There was a flash of flame in the 
"very middle of the office, leaving "
behind a single golden feather th
at floated gently
 to the floor. 
"“It is Fawkes’s warning,” said Du"
"mbledore, catching the feather as "
"it fell. “She must know you’re out of your beds. . . . Minerva, go and "
head her off — tell
 her any story —” 
Professor McGonagall was go
ne in a swish of tartan. 
"“He says he’ll be delighted,” sa"
id a bored voice behind Dumble-
dore; the wizard called Phineas 
had reappeared in front of his 
Slytherin banner. “My great-great-gr
andson has alwa
ys had odd taste 
in houseguests. . . .” 
"“Come here, then,” Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys. "
"“And quickly, before anyo"
ne else joins us . . .” 
Harry and the others gathered
 around Dumbledore’s desk. 
“You have all used a Portkey befo
"re?” asked Dumbledore, and they "
"nodded, each reaching out to touch "
some part of the 
blackened kettle. 
“Good. On the count of three th
en . . . one . . . two . . .” 
It happened in a fraction of a second: In the infinitesimal pause be-
"fore Dumbledore said “three,” Harry looked up at him — they were "
very close together — and Dumbledor
e’s clear blue gaze moved from 
the Portkey to Harry’s face. 
"At once, Harry’s scar burned whit"
"e-hot, as though the old wound "
had burst open again — and unbidd
"en, unwanted, but terrifyingly "
"strong, there rose within Harry a hatr"
ed so powerful he
" felt, for that  "
   475 "instant, that he would like nothing "
better than to strike — to bite — 
to sink his fangs into
 the man before him — 
“. . . 
three.
” 
He felt a powerful jerk behind his 
"navel, the ground vanished from "
"beneath his feet, his hand was glued to"
 the kettle; he was banging into 
the others as all sped forward in a 
"swirl of colors and a rush of wind, "
the kettle pulling them
 onward and then — 
His feet hit the ground so hard th
"at his knees buckled, the kettle "
clattered to the ground and somewh
"ere close at hand a voice said, "
"“Back again, the blood traitor brats, is "
it true their father’s dying . . . ?” 
“OUT!” roared a second voice. 
Harry scrambled to his feet and look
ed around; they had arrived in 
the gloomy basement kitchen of nu
"mber twelve, Grimmauld Place. "
"The only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle, "
which illuminated the remains of a 
solitary supper. Kreacher was dis-
appearing through the door to the ha
"ll, looking back at them malevo-"
lently as he hitched up his loinclot
h; Sirius was hurrying toward them 
"all, looking anxious. He was unsh"
aven and still in his day clothes; 
there was also a slightly Mundungu
s-like whiff of stale drink about 
him. 
"“What’s going on?” he said, stretc"
hing out a hand to help Ginny 
up. “Phineas Nigellus said Ar
thur’s been ba
dly injured —” 
"“Ask Harry,” said Fred. "
"“Yeah, I want to hear this"
" for myself,” said George. "
The twins and Ginny were staring 
at him. Kreacher’s footsteps had 
stopped on the stairs outside. 
“It was —” Harry began; this was 
even worse than telling McGona-
gall and Dumbledore. 
“I had a — a kind of
 — vision. . . .” 
And he told them all that he had 
"seen, though he altered the story "
so that it sounded as though he ha
d watched from the sidelines as the 
"snake attacked, rather th"
an from behind the snake’s own eyes. . . .  
 476 "Ron, who was still very white, ga"
"ve him a fleeting look, but did not "
"speak. When Harry had finished, Fred, George, and Ginny continued "
to stare at him for a moment. Ha
rry did not know whether he was 
"imagining it or not, but he fancied there was something accusatory in "
"their looks. Well, if they were goin"
g to blame him for 
just seeing the 
"attack, he was glad he had not told"
 them that he had been inside the 
snake at the 
time. . . . 
“Is Mum here?” said Fr
"ed, turning to Sirius. "
“She probably doesn’t even know wh
"at’s happened yet,” said Sirius. "
“The important thing was to get yo
u away before Umbridge could in-
terfere. I expect Dumbledore
’s letting Molly know now.” 
"“We’ve got to go to St. Mungo’s,"
” said Ginny urgently. She looked 
around at her brothers; they were of 
course still in their pajamas. “Sir-
"ius, can you lend us cl"
oaks or anything — ?” 
"“Hang on, you can’t go tearing of"
f to St. Mungo’s!” said Sirius. 
"“’Course we can go to St. Mungo’s if we want,” said Fred, with a "
"mulish expression, “he’s our dad!” "
“And how are you going to explai
n how you knew Arthur was at-
tacked before the hospital 
even let his wife know?” 
“What does that matter?” said George hotly. 
“It matters because we don’t want to
 draw attention to the fact that 
Harry is having visions of things th
at are happening hundreds of miles 
away!” said Sirius angrily. “Have you any idea what the Ministry 
would make of that information?” 
Fred and George looked as though they could not care less what the 
Ministry made of anything. Ron was still white-faced and silent. 
"Ginny said, “Somebody else could ha"
ve told us. . . . We could have 
heard it somewhere othe
r than Harry. . . .” 
“Like who?” said Sirius impatiently.
" “Listen, your dad’s been hurt "
while on duty for the Order and the circumstances are fishy enough 
without his children knowing about 
"it seconds after it happened, you "
could seriously damage the Order’s —” 
   477 “We don’t care about the du
mb Order!” shouted Fred. 
“It’s our dad dying we’re talk
ing about!” yelled George. 
"“Your father knew what he was getting into, and he won’t thank "
you for messing things up for the Or
der!” said Sirius angrily in his 
turn. “This is how it is — this is why you’re not in the Order — you 
don’t understand — there ar
e things worth dying for!” 
"“Easy for you to say, stuck here!”"
 bellowed Fred. “I don’t see you 
risking your neck!” 
The little color remaining in Siri
us’s face drained from it. He 
looked for a moment as though he 
"would quite like to hit Fred, but "
"when he spoke, it was in a voice of "
"determined calm. “I know it’s hard, "
but we’ve all got to act as though 
we don’t know anything yet. We’ve 
"got to stay put, at least until we "
"hear from your mother, all right?” "
Fred and George still looked muti
"nous. Ginny, however, took a few "
steps over to the nearest chair and sa
"nk into it. Harry looked at Ron, "
"who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and shrug, "
and they sat down too. The twins glar
"ed at Sirius for another minute, "
then took seats on either side of Ginny. 
"“That’s right,” said Sirius encouragi"
"ngly, “come on, let’s all . . . let’s "
all have a drink wh
ile we’re waiting. 
Accio Butterbeer
!” 
He raised his wand as he spoke an
d half a dozen bottles came flying 
"toward them out of the pantry, skidded along the table, scattering the "
"debris of Sirius’s meal, and stopped "
neatly in front of the six of them. 
"They all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the crack-"
ling of the kitchen 
fire and the soft thud of 
their bottles on the table. 
Harry was only drinking to have 
something to do with his hands. 
"His stomach was full of horrible hot, bubbling guilt. They would not "
be here if it were not for him; they would all still be asleep in bed. And 
it was no good telling himself that 
by raising the alar
m he had ensured 
"that Mr. Weasley was found, becaus"
e there was also the inescapable 
business of it being he who had at
tacked Mr. Weasley in the first 
place. . . . 
 478 "Don’t be stupid, you haven’t got fangs,"
" he told himself, trying to keep "
"calm, though the hand on his butterbeer bottle was shaking. "
You were 
"lying in bed, you were"
n’t attacking anyone.
 . . . 
"But then, what just happened in Dumbledore’s office"
? he asked him-
self. 
I felt like I wanted to attack Dumbledore too.
 . . . 
He put the bottle down on the tabl
e a little harder than he meant 
"to, so that it slopped over onto "
the table. No one 
took any notice. 
Then a burst of fire in midair illumi
nated the dirty plates in front of 
"them and as they gave cries of shock, a scroll of parchment fell with a "
"thud onto the table, accompanied "
by a single golden phoenix tail 
feather. 
"“Fawkes!” said Sirius at once, snatching up the parchment. “That’s "
not Dumbledore’s writing — it must be a message from your 
mother — here —” 
He thrust the letter into Geor
"ge’s hand, who ripped it open and "
"read aloud, “"
Dad is still alive. I am setting out for St. Mungo’s now. Stay 
where you are. I wi
ll send news as so
on as I can. Mum.
” 
George looked ar
ound the table. 
“Still alive . . .” he said slowly
. “But that makes 
it sound . . .” 
He did not need to finish the sent
ence. It sounded to Harry too as 
though Mr. Weasley was hovering 
somewhere between life and death. 
"Still exceptionally pale, Ron stared at"
 the back of his mother’s letter as 
though it might speak words of comfort to him. Fred pulled the 
parchment out of George’s hands an
"d read it for himself, then looked "
"up at Harry, who felt his hand shak"
ing on his butterbeer bottle again 
and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling. 
If Harry had ever sat through a long
er night than this one he could 
not remember it. Sirius suggested on
"ce that they all go to bed, but "
"without any real conviction, and th"
e Weasleys’ looks of disgust were 
answer enough. They mostly sat in 
silence around the 
"table, watching "
the candle wick sinking lower and 
"lower into liquid wax, now and "
"then raising bottles to their lips, sp"
"eaking only to check the time, to "
   479 "wonder aloud what was happening, "
and to reassure one another that 
"if there was bad news, they woul"
"d know straightaway, for Mrs. "
Weasley must long since have arrived at St. Mungo’s. 
"Fred fell into a doze, his head sagging sideways onto his shoulder. "
Ginny was curled like 
"a cat on her chair, bu"
t her eyes were open; 
Harry could see them reflecting the fi
relight. Ron was sitting with his 
"head in his hands, whether awake or "
asleep it was impossible to tell. 
And he and Sirius looked at each ot
"her every so often, intruders upon "
"the family grief, wait"
ing . . . waiting . . . 
"And then, at ten past five in "
"the morning by Ron’s watch, the "
kitchen door swung open and Mrs. Weasley entered the kitchen. She 
"was extremely pale, but when they all tu"
"rned to look at her, Fred, Ron, "
and Harry half-rising from their 
"chairs, she gave a wan smile. "
"“He’s going to be all right,” she said, her voice weak with tiredness. "
“He’s sleeping. We can all go and see 
him later. Bill’s sitting with him 
"now, he’s going to take the morning off work.” "
Fred fell back into his chair with
 his hands over his face. George 
"and Ginny got up, walked swiftly "
"over to their mother, and hugged "
her. Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his butterbeer 
in one. 
“Breakfast!” said Sirius loudly 
"and joyfully, jumping to his feet. "
“Where’s that accursed hous
e-elf? Kreacher! KREACHER!” 
But Kreacher did not answer the summons. 
"“Oh, forget it, then,” muttered Siri"
"us, counting the people in front "
"of him. “So it’s breakfast for — let’s see — seven . . . Bacon and eggs, "
"I think, and some "
"tea, and toast —” "
Harry hurried over to the stove to 
help. He did not want to intrude 
"upon the Weasleys’ happiness, an"
d he dreaded the moment when 
"Mrs. Weasley would ask him to recount his vision. However, he had "
barely taken plates from the dres
ser when Mrs. Weasley lifted them 
out of his hands and pu
lled him into a hug. 
“I don’t know what would have happ
"ened if it hadn’t been for you, "
 480 "Harry,” she said in a muffled voic"
e. “They might not have found 
"Arthur for hours, and then it would "
"have been too late, but thanks to "
you he’s alive and Dumbledore’s b
een able to think up a good cover 
"story for Arthur being where he was,"
 you’ve no idea what trouble he 
"would have been in otherwise, "
look at poor Sturgis. . . .” 
Harry could hardly stand her gratit
"ude, but fortunately she soon "
released him to turn to Sirius and 
thank him for looking after her chil-
dren through the night. Sirius said that he was very pleased to have 
"been able to help, and hoped they would all stay with him as long as "
Mr. Weasley was in hospital. 
"“Oh, Sirius, I’m so grateful. . . . They think he’ll be there a little "
"while and it would be wonderful to be nearer . . . Of course, that "
might mean we’re here 
for Christmas. . . .” 
“The more the merrier!” said Sirius
 with such obvious sincerity that 
"Mrs. Weasley beamed at him, threw "
"on an apron, and began to help "
with breakfast. 
"“Sirius,” Harry muttered, unable to stand it a moment longer. "
“Can I have a quick word? Er — 
now
?” 
He walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed. Without pre-
amble Harry told his godf
ather every detail of th
"e vision he had had, "
including the fact that he hims
elf had been the snake who had at-
tacked Mr. Weasley. 
"When he paused for breath, Sirius said, “Did you tell Dumbledore "
this?” 
"“Yes,” said Harry impatiently, “but he"
 didn’t tell me what it meant. 
"Well, he doesn’t tell me "
anything anymore. . . .” 
“I’m sure he would have told 
you if it was anything to worry 
"about,” said Sirius steadily. "
“But that’s not a
"ll,” said Harry in a voice on"
ly a little above a whis-
"per. “Sirius, I . . . I think I’m going mad. . . . Back in Dumbledore’s "
"office, just before we "
took the Portkey . . . for a couple of seconds  
   481 "there I thought I was a snake, I "
felt
 like one — my scar really hurt 
when I was looking at Dumbledore
" — Sirius, I want"
ed to attack 
him —” 
He could only see a sliver of Sirius
’s face; the rest was in darkness. 
"“It must have been the aftermath of the vision, that’s all,” said Sir-"
ius. “You were still thinking of th
e dream or whatever it was and —” 
"“It wasn’t that,” said Harry, shak"
ing his head. “It was like some-
thing rose up inside
" me, like there’s a "
snake
 inside me —” 
"“You need to sleep,” said Sirius firmly. “You’re going to have break-"
"fast and then go upstairs to bed, and then you can go and see Arthur "
after lunch with the others. You’re
" in shock, Harry; you’re blaming "
yourself for something you only 
"witnessed, and it’s lucky you "
did
 wit-
ness it or Arthur mi
ght have died. Just st
op worrying. . . .” 
"He clapped Harry on the shoulder and left the pantry, leaving "
Harry standing alone in the dark. 
Everyone but Harry spent the rest of
 the morning sleeping. He went 
up to the bedroom he had shared wi
"th Ron over the summer, but while "
Ron crawled into bed and was asleep
" within minutes, Harry sat fully "
"clothed, hunched against the cold me"
"tal bars of the bedstead, keeping "
"himself deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze, "
terrified that he might become the se
rpent again in his sleep and awake 
"to find that he had attacked Ron, "
or else slithered through the house 
after one of the others. . . . 
"When Ron woke up, Harry pretended "
to have enjoyed a refreshing 
nap too. Their trunks arrived from 
Hogwarts while they were eating 
"lunch, so that they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St. Mungo’s. "
Everybody except Harry 
was riotously happy and talkative as they 
"changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts, and they greeted "
"Tonks and Mad-Eye, who had turned"
 up to escort them across Lon-
"don, gleefully laughing at the bowler hat Mad-Eye was wearing at an  "
 482 angle to conceal his magical eye an
"d assuring him, truthfully, that "
"Tonks, whose hair was short and brig"
"ht pink again, would attract far "
less attention on 
the underground. 
Tonks was very interested in Harry’
s vision of the attack on Mr. 
"Weasley, something he was not remotely interested in discussing. "
“There isn’t any 
Seer
" blood in your family, is there?” she inquired "
"curiously, as they sat side by side "
on a train rattling toward the heart 
of the city. 
"“No,” said Harry, thinking of "
Professor Trelawney and feeling 
insulted. 
"“No,” said Tonks musingly, “no, I "
suppose it’s not really prophecy 
"you’re doing, is it? I mean, you’re not seeing the future, you’re seeing "
"the present. . . . It’s odd, is"
"n’t it? Useful, though . . .” "
"Harry did not answer; fortunately they got out at the next stop, a "
"station in the very heart of London, "
and in the bustle of leaving the 
train he was able to allow Fred an
d George to get between himself and 
"Tonks, who was leading the way. They"
 all followed her up the escala-
"tor, Moody clunking along at the back"
" of the group, his bowler tilted "
low and one gnarled hand stuck in
" between the buttons of his coat, "
clutching his wand. Harry thought he
 sensed the concealed eye star-
ing hard at him; trying to deflect 
more questions about his dream he 
asked Mad-Eye where St
. Mungo’s was hidden. 
"“Not far from here,” grunted Moody"
 as they stepped out into the 
wintry air on a broad store-lined st
reet packed with Christmas shop-
pers. He pushed Harry a little ah
ead of him and stumped along just 
behind; Harry knew the eye was rolli
ng in all directions under the 
tilted hat. “Wasn’t easy to find a 
good location for a hospital. Nowhere 
in Diagon Alley was big enough and 
we couldn’t have it underground 
like the Ministry — unhealthy. In the end they managed to get hold of 
a building up here. Theory was sick
 wizards could come and go and 
just blend in with 
the crowd. . . .” 
   483 He seized Harry’s shoulder to pr
event them being separated by a 
gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a 
nearby shop full of electrical gadgets. 
"“Here we go,” said Mo"
ody a moment later. 
"They had arrived outside a large, "
"old-fashioned, red brick depart-"
ment store called Purge and Dowse 
"Ltd. The place had a shabby, mis-"
erable air; the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies 
"with their wigs askew, "
standing at random and 
modeling fashions at 
least ten years out of date. Large 
signs on all the dusty doors read 
closed for refurbishment
. Harry distinctly heard a large woman 
laden with plastic shopping bags say 
"to her friend as they passed, “It’s "
never
" open, that place. . . .” "
"“Right,” said Tonks, beckoning them forward to a window display-"
ing nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy whose false eye-
lashes were hanging of
f and who was modeling a green nylon pinafore 
dress. “Everybody ready?” 
"They nodded, clustering around "
her; Moody gave Harry another 
shove between the shoulder blades 
to urge him forward and Tonks 
"leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy and said, "
"her breath steaming up the glass, "
“Wotcher . . . We’re here to see 
Arthur Weasley.” 
"For a split second, Harry thought how absurd it was for Tonks to ex-"
pect the dummy to hear her talkin
g that quietly through a sheet of 
"glass, when there were buses rumbling along behind her and all the "
racket of a street full of shoppers. Then he reminded himself that dum-
mies could not hear an
yway. Next second his mouth opened in shock 
"as the dummy gave a tiny nod, beckoned its jointed finger, and Tonks "
had seized Ginny and Mrs. Weasle
"y by the elbows, stepped right "
through the gla
ss and vanished. 
"Fred, George, and Ron stepped af"
ter them; Harry glanced around 
at the jostling crowd; not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare  
 484 "for window displays as ugly as Purge and Dowse Ltd.’s, nor did any of "
them seem to have noticed that six 
people had just melted into thin 
air in front of them. 
"“C’mon,” growled Moody, giving "
Harry yet another poke in the 
back and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet 
"of cool water, emerging quite "
warm and dry on 
the other side. 
There was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had 
stood. They had arrived in what s
eemed to be a crowded reception 
area where rows of witches and 
wizards sat upon rickety wooden 
"chairs, some looking perfectly normal"
 and perusing out-of-date copies 
of 
"Witch Weekly,"
 others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as ele-
phant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests. The room was 
scarcely less quiet than the street ou
"tside, for many of the patients were "
making very peculiar noises. A sweaty
-faced witch in the center of the 
"front row, who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the "
Daily 
"Prophet,"
 kept letting off a high-pitched
 whistle as steam came pouring 
"out of her mouth, and a grubby-looki"
ng warlock in the corner clanged 
"like a bell every time he moved, an"
d with each clang his head vibrated 
"horribly, so that he had to seize hims"
elf by the ears and hold it steady. 
Witches and wizards in lime-gre
en robes were walking up and 
"down the rows, asking questions and "
making notes on clipboards like 
Umbridge’s. Harry noticed the embl
em embroidered on their chests: 
"a wand and bone, crossed. "
“Are they doctors?” he asked Ron quietly. 
"“Doctors?” said Ron, looking star"
tled. “Those Muggle nutters that 
"cut people up? Nah, they’re Healers.” "
“Over here!” called Mr
s. Weasley over the re
newed clanging of the 
"warlock in the corner, and they followed her to the queue in front of a "
plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked 
inquiries.
 The wall be-
hind her was covered in notices an
d posters saying things like 
a clean 
cauldron keeps potions from becoming poisons
 and 
antidotes 
are anti-don’ts unless approved by a qualified healer
. 
   485 There was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets 
that was labelled 
DILYS DERWENT 
st. mungo’s healer 1722–1741 
headmistress of hogwarts school of 
"witchcraft and wizardry, i74i–i768 "
Dilys was eyeing the Weasley party 
as though counting them; when 
Harry caught her eye she gave a tiny 
"wink, walked sideways out of her "
"portrait, and vanished. "
"Meanwhile, at the front of the qu"
"eue, a young wizard was perform-"
ing an odd on-the-spot jig and tryi
"ng, in between yelps of pain, to "
explain his predicament to 
the witch behind the desk. 
“It’s these — ouch — shoes my br
other gave me — ow — they’re 
eating my — OUCH — f
"eet — look at them, "
there must be some 
kind of — AARGH — jinx on 
them and I can’t — AAAAARGH — 
get them off —” 
He hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot 
coals. 
“The shoes don’t prevent you read
"ing, do they?” said the blonde "
"witch irritably, pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk. “You "
"want Spell Damage, fourth floor. Just "
like it says on the floor guide. 
Next!” 
The wizard hobbled and pranced 
"sideways out of the way, the "
Weasley party moved forward a few
 steps and Harry read the floor 
guide:

"If you are unsure where to go, "
"incapable, of normal speech, or "
"unable to remember why you are here, our Welcome Witch will "
be pleased to help. 
"A very old, stooped wizard with "
a hearing trumpet had shuffled to 
the front of the queue now. 
“I’m here to see Broderick Bode!” he wheezed. 
"“Ward forty-nine, but I’m afraid you’re wasting your time,” said the "
witch dismissively “He’s completely 
"addled, you know, still thinks he’s "
a teapot. . . . Next!” 
A harassed-looking wizard was hold
ing his small daughter tightly 
by the ankle while she flapped arou
nd his head using the immensely 
"large, feathery wings that had spro"
uted right out the back of her 
romper suit. 
"“Fourth floor,” said the witch in "
"a bored voice, without asking, and "
the man disappeared through the dou
"ble doors beside the desk, hold-"
ing his daughter like an 
oddly shaped balloon. “Next!” 
Mrs. Weasley moved forward to the desk. 
"“Hello,” she said. “My husband, "
"Arthur Weasley, was supposed to "
"be moved to a different ward this morning, could you tell us — ?” "
"“Arthur Weasley?” said the witch, "
running her finger down a long  
   487 "list in front of her. “Yes, first fl"
"oor, second door on the right, Dai "
Llewellyn ward.” 
"“Thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Come on, you lot.” "
They followed through the doubl
e doors and along the narrow cor-
"ridor beyond, which was lined with "
more portraits of famous Healers 
"and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling, "
looking like giant soapsuds. More witches and wizards in lime-green 
robes walked in and out of the doors they passed; a foul-smelling yel-
low gas wafted into the passageway as
" they passed one door, and every "
now and then they heard distant wail
ing. They climbed a flight of 
"stairs and entered the “Creature-Induced Injuries” corridor, where the "
second door on the right bore the words 
“
dangerous
”
 dai llewellyn 
ward: serious bites
. Underneath this was a card in a brass holder on 
which had been handwritten 
Healer-in-Charge: Hippocrates Smeth-
"wyck, Trainee Healer: Augustus Pye."
"“We’ll wait outside, Molly,” To"
nks said. “Arthur won’t want too 
many visitors at once. . . . It ou
ght to be just the family first.” 
Mad-Eye growled his approval of t
his idea and set himself with his 
"back against the corridor wall, his "
magical eye spinning in all direc-
"tions. Harry drew back too, but Mr"
s. Weasley reached out a hand and 
"pushed him through the door, saying"
", “Don’t be silly, Harry, Arthur "
wants to thank you. . . .” 
The ward was small and rather dingy as the only window was narrow 
and set high in the wall facing the door. Most of the light came from 
more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling. The 
walls were of panelled oak and there 
was a portrait of a rather vicious-
"looking wizard on the wall, captioned "
"urquhart rackharrow, 1612–"
"1697, inventor of the entrail-expelling curse"
. 
There were only three patients. 
Mr. Weasley was occupying the bed 
at the far end of the ward beside th
e tiny window. Harry was pleased and 
relieved to see that he was propped up
 on several pillows and reading the  
 488 Daily Prophet
 by the solitary ray of sunlight falling onto his bed. He 
looked around as they walked towa
"rd him and, seeing whom it was, "
beamed. 
"“Hello!” he called, throwing the "
Prophet
" aside. “Bill just left, Molly, "
"had to get back to work, but he says "
he’ll drop in on you later. . . .” 
"“How are you, Arthur?” asked Mrs. Weasley, bending down to kiss "
his cheek and looking anxiously into his face. “You’re still looking a bit 
peaky. . . .” 
"“I feel absolutely fine,” said Mr. "
"Weasley brightly, holding out his "
good arm to give Ginny a hug. “If th
ey could only ta
ke the bandages 
"off, I’d be fit to go home.” "
“Why can’t they take them
" off, Dad?” asked Fred. "
"“Well, I start bleeding like mad "
"every time they try,” said Mr. "
"Weasley cheerfully, reaching across "
"for his wand, which lay on his bed-"
"side cabinet, and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bed-"
side to seat them all. “It seems there was some rather unusual kind of 
poison in that snake’s fangs that k
eeps wounds open. . . . They’re sure 
"they’ll find an antidote, though, "
they say they’ve had much worse 
"cases than mine, and in the meantime"
 I just have to keep taking a 
Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour. 
"But that fellow over there,” he "
"said, dropping his voice and noddi"
ng toward the bed opposite in 
which a man lay looking green and si
ckly and staring at the ceiling. 
“Bitten by a 
"werewolf,"
 poor chap. No cure at all.” 
"“A werewolf?” whispered Mrs. Weasley, looking alarmed. “Is he "
safe in a public ward? Shouldn’
t he be in a private room?” 
"“It’s two weeks till full moon,” Mr. Weasley reminded her quietly. "
“They’ve been talking to him this 
"morning, the Healers, you know, "
trying to persuade him he’ll be able
 to lead an almost normal life. I 
said to him — didn’t m
"ention names, of course — but I said I knew a "
"werewolf personally, very nice man, who finds the condition quite "
easy to manage. . . .” 
“What did he say?” asked George. 
   489 “Said he’d give me anothe
"r bite if I didn’t shut up,” said Mr. Weasley "
sadly. “And that woman over 
"there,"
” he indicated the only other occu-
"pied bed, which was right beside th"
"e door, “won’t tell the Healers what "
"bit her, which makes us all think it"
 must have been something she was 
handling illegally. Whatever it was 
"took a real chunk out of her leg, "
very
 nasty smell when they 
take off the dressings.” 
"“So, you going to tell us what "
"happened, Dad?” asked Fred, pulling "
his chair closer to the bed. 
"“Well, you already know, don’t you?"
"” said Mr. Weasley, with a sig-"
nificant smile at Harry. “It’s very 
"simple — I’d had a very long day, "
"dozed off, got sneake"
"d up on, and bitten.” "
“Is it in the 
"Prophet,"
" you being attacked?” asked Fred, indicating the "
newspaper Mr. Weasley had cast aside. 
"“No, of course not,” said Mr. Weasley, with a slightly bitter smile, "
“the Ministry wouldn’t want everyo
ne to know a dirty great serpent 
got —” 
“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley warningly. 
"“— got — er — me,” Mr. Weasley "
"said hastily, though Harry was "
quite sure that was not wh
at he had meant to say. 
“So where were you when it 
"happened, Dad?” asked George. "
"“That’s my business,” said Mr. Weas"
"ley, though with a small smile. "
He snatched up the 
"Daily Prophet,"
" shook it open again and said, “I "
was just reading about Willy Widders
hins’s arrest when you arrived. 
You know Willy turned out to be 
behind those regurgitating toilets 
last summer? One of his jinxes backfi
"red, the toilet ex"
"ploded, and they "
found him lying unconscious in the 
wreckage covered from head to 
foot in —” 
“When you say you were ‘on duty
",’” Fred interrupted in a low "
"voice, “what were you doing?” "
"“You heard your father,” whispered Mrs. Weasley, “we are not dis-"
"cussing this here! Go on about Willy Widdershins, Arthur —” "
"“Well, don’t ask me how, but he "
actually got off on the toilet 
 490 "charge,” said Mr. Weasley grimly. “I can only suppose gold changed "
hands —” 
"“You were guarding it, weren’t you?” said George quietly. “The "
weapon? The thing You-Know-Who’s after?” 
"“George, be quiet!” snapped Mrs. Weasley. "
"“Anyway,” said Mr. Weasley in a ra"
"ised voice, “this time Willy’s "
been caught selling biting doorknob
"s to Muggles, and I don’t think "
he’ll be able to worm his way out of
 it because accord
ing to this arti-
"cle, two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St. Mungo’s for "
emergency bone regrowth and memory 
"modification. Just think of it, "
Muggles in St. Mungo’s! I wond
er which ward they’re in?” 
And he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost. 
“Didn’t you say You-Know-Who’s go
"t a snake, Harry?” asked Fred, "
looking at his father for a reaction
. “A massive one? You saw it the 
"night he returned, didn’t you?” "
"“That’s enough,” said Mrs. Weasley crossly. “Mad-Eye and Tonks "
"are outside, Arthur, they want to come and see you. And you lot can "
"wait outside,” she added to her children and Harry. “You can come "
and say good-bye afterward. Go on. . . .” 
They trooped back into the corri
dor. Mad-Eye and Tonks went in 
and closed the door of the ward behind them. Fred raised his eyebrows. 
"“Fine,” he said coolly, rummaging in his pockets, “be like that. "
Don’t tell us anything.” 
"“Looking for these?” said George, "
holding out what looked like a 
tangle of flesh-colored string. 
"“You read my mind,” said Fred, gr"
inning. “Let’s see if St. Mungo’s 
puts Imperturbable 
Charms on its ward
" doors, shall we?” "
He and George disentangled the st
ring and separated five Extend-
able Ears from each other. Fred
 and George handed them around. 
Harry hesitated to take one. 
"“Go on, Harry, take it! You saved Dad’s life, if anyone’s got the right "
to eavesdrop on him it’s you. . . .” 
   491 "Grinning in spite of himself, Harr"
y took the end of the string and 
inserted it into his ea
r as the twins had done. 
"“Okay, go!” Fred whispered. "
The flesh-colored strings wriggled 
"like long skinny worms, then "
"snaked under the door. For a few seconds Harry could hear nothing, "
then he heard Tonks whispering as 
clearly as though she were stand-
ing right beside him. 
“. . . they searched the whole area
 but they couldn’t find the snake 
"anywhere, it just seems to have vani"
"shed after it attacked you, Arthur. "
". . . But You-Know-Who can’t have expected a snake to get in, can "
he?” 
“I reckon he sent it 
"as a lookout,” growled Moody, “’cause he’s not "
"had any luck so far, has he? No, I reckon he’s trying to get a clearer pic-"
ture of what he’s facing and if 
Arthur hadn’t been there the beast 
would’ve had much more time to l
ook around. So Potter says he saw 
it all happen?” 
"“Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded rather uneasy. “You know, "
Dumbledore seems almost to have
 been waiting for Harry to see 
something like this. . . .” 
"“Yeah, well,” said Moody, “there’s something funny about the "
"Potter kid, we all know that.” "
“Dumbledore seemed worried ab
out Harry when I spoke to him 
"this morning,” whispe"
red Mrs. Weasley. 
"“’Course he’s worried,” growled Moody. “The boy’s seeing things "
from inside You-Know-Who’s snake. 
". . . Obviously, Potter doesn’t re-"
"alize what that means, but if You-Know-Who’s possessing him —” "
Harry pulled the Extendable Ear ou
"t of his own, his heart ham-"
mering very fast and heat rushing up
 his face. He looked around at the 
others. They were all star
"ing at him, the strings st"
ill trailing from their 
"ears, looking suddenly fearful. "
Was this why Dumbledore would no longer meet Harry’s 
"eyes? Did he expect to see Voldemort staring out of them, "
"afraid, perhaps, that their vivid gr"
"een might turn suddenly to scarlet, "
with catlike slits for pupils? Harry 
remembered how the snakelike face 
of Voldemort had once forced itself 
out of the back of Professor Quir-
"rell’s head, and he ran his hand over the back of his own, wondering "
what it would feel like if Voldem
ort burst out of 
his skull. . . . 
"He felt dirty, contaminated, as "
though he were carrying some 
"deadly germ, unworthy to sit on th"
e underground train back from the 
"hospital with innocent, clean peop"
le whose minds and bodies were 
free of the taint of Voldemort. . . . 
"He had not merely seen the snake, "
he had 
been
" the snake, he knew it now. . . . "
And then a truly terrible though
"t occurred to him, a memory bob-"
"bing to the surface of his mind, o"
ne that made his insides writhe and 
squirm like serpents. . . . 
“
What’s he after apart from followers
?” 
“
Stuff he can only get by stealth . . . 
like a weapon. Something he didn’t 
have last time.
” 
W 
   493 "I’m the weapon, "
"Harry thought, and it was as though poison were "
"pumping through his veins, chilling "
"him, bringing him out in a sweat "
as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel. 
I’m the one Volde-
"mort’s trying to use, that’s why they’ve got guards around me everywhere I "
"go, it’s not for my protection, it’s for "
"other people’s, only it’s not working, "
they can’t have someone on me a
ll the time at Hogwarts. . . . I 
did 
attack 
"Mr. Weasley last night, it was me, Voldemort made me do it and he could "
"be inside me, listening to"
 my thoughts right now.
 . . . 
"“Are you all right, Harry, dear?”"
" whispered Mrs. Weasley, leaning "
across Ginny to speak to him as th
e train rattled along through its 
dark tunnel. “You
 don’t look very well. 
Are you feeling sick?” 
They were all watching him. He
 shook his head violently and 
stared up at an advertis
ement for home insurance. 
"“Harry, dear, are you "
sure
 you’re all right?” said Mrs. Weasley in a 
"worried voice, as they walked arou"
nd the unkempt patch of grass in 
the middle of Grimmauld Place. “You 
look ever so pale. . . . Are you 
sure you slept this morning? You go
 upstairs to be
"d right now, and "
you can have a couple of hours’ 
sleep before dinn
"er, all right?” "
He nodded; here was a ready-made ex
cuse not to talk to any of the 
"others, which was precisely what "
"he wanted, so when she opened the "
front door he proceeded straight past
 the troll’s leg umbrella stand and 
up the stairs and hurried in
to his and Ron’s bedroom. 
Here he began to pace up and dow
"n, past the two beds and Phineas "
"Nigellus’s empty portrait, his brain "
teeming and seething with ques-
tions and ever more dr
eadful ideas. . . . 
How had he become a snake? Perhaps he was an Animagus. . . . 
"No, he couldn’t be, he would know. . . . perhaps "
Voldemort
 was an 
Animagus. . . . 
"Yes,"
" thought Harry, "
"that would fit, he"
 would 
turn into 
a snake of course . . . and when he’s
" possessing me, then we both trans-"
form. . . . That still doesn’t explain 
how come I got to London and back 
"to my bed in the space of about five minutes, though. . . . But then "
Voldemort’s about the most powerful
" wizard in the world, apart from"
 494 "Dumbledore, it’s probably no problem "
at all to him to transport people 
like that. . . .
"And then, with a terrible st"
"ab of panic he thought, "
but this is in-
sane 
— 
"if Voldemort’s possessing me, I’m giving him a clear view into the "
headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now! He’ll know who’s in 
the Order and where Sirius is . . . and I’ve heard loads of stuff I shouldn’t 
"have, everything Sirius told me "
the first night I was here. . . .
There was only one thing for it: 
He would have to leave Grim-
mauld Place straightaway. He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts 
"without the others, which would keep"
 them safe over the holidays at 
"least. . . . But no, that wouldn’t do, there were still plenty of people at "
"Hogwarts to maim and injure, what if it was Seamus, Dean, or Neville "
next time? He stopped his pacing 
and stood staring at Phineas Nigel-
lus’s empty frame. A leaden sensatio
n was settling in the pit of his 
stomach. He had no alternative: He
 was going to have to return to 
"Privet Drive, cut himself off fr"
om other wizards 
entirely. . . . 
"Well, if he had to do it, he thou"
"ght, there was no point hanging "
around. Trying with all his might no
t to think how the Dursleys were 
going to react when they found him 
on their doorstep six months ear-
"lier than they had expected, he str"
"ode over to his trunk, slammed the "
"lid shut and locked it, then glance"
d around automatically for Hedwig 
before remembering that
 she was still at Hogw
"arts — well, her cage "
would be one less thing to carry — he
 seized one end of his trunk and 
had dragged it halfway toward th
"e door when a sneaky voice said, "
"“Running away, are we?” "
He looked around. Phineas Nigellus
 had appeared upon the canvas 
of his portrait and was leaning agai
"nst the frame, watching Harry with "
an amused expression on his face. 
"“Not running away, no,” said Ha"
"rry shortly, dragging his trunk a "
few more feet across the room. 
"“I thought,” said Phineas Nigell"
"us, stroking his pointed beard, "
“that to belong in Gryffindor 
House you were supposed to be 
brave
? 
   495 It looks to me as though you woul
d have been better off in my own 
"house. We Slytherins are brave, "
"yes, but not stupid. For instance, "
"given the choice, we will always"
 choose to save our own necks.” 
"“It’s not my own neck I’m saving,” said Harry tersely, tugging the "
"trunk over a patch of particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in "
front of the door. 
“Oh I 
"see,"
” said Phineas Nigellu
"s, still stroking his beard. “This is "
no cowardly flight
 — you are being 
noble.
” 
Harry ignored him. His hand was 
on the doorknob when Phineas 
"Nigellus said lazily, “I have a messa"
ge for you from Albus Dumbledore.” 
Harry spun around. 
“What is it?” 
“Stay where you are.” 
"“I haven’t moved!” said Harry, hi"
s hand still up
on the doorknob. 
“So what’s the message?” 
"“I have just given it to you, dolt,” said Phineas Nigellus smoothly. "
"“Dumbledore says, ‘"
Stay where you are.
’” 
"“Why?” said Harry eagerly, droppi"
ng the end of his trunk. “Why 
does he want me to stay? What else did he say?” 
"“Nothing whatsoever,” said Phinea"
"s Nigellus, raising a thin black "
eyebrow as though he found Harry impertinent. 
Harry’s temper rose to the surface 
like a snake rearing from long 
"grass. He was exhausted, he was confused beyond measure, he had ex-"
"perienced terror, relief, and then terro"
"r again in the last twelve hours, "
and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him! 
"“So that’s it, is it?” he said loudly. “"
Stay there
? That’s all anyone 
could tell me after I got 
attacked by those dement
ors too! Just stay put 
"while the grown-ups sort it out, "
Harry! We won’t bo
ther telling you 
"anything, though, because your tiny "
little brain might not be able to 
cope with it!” 
"“You know,” said Phineas Nigell"
"us, even more loudly than Harry, "
“this is precisely why I 
loathed
 being a teacher! Young people are so 
 496 infernally convinced that they are 
absolutely right about everything. 
"Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there "
might be an excellent reason why th
e headmaster of Hogwarts is not 
confiding every tiny detail of his pl
"ans to you? Have you never paused, "
"while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore’s or-"
ders has never yet led you into ha
"rm? No. No, like all young people, "
you are quite sure that you alone 
"feel and think, you alone recognize "
"danger, you alone are the only one cl"
ever enough to realize what the 
Dark Lord may be 
planning. . . .” 
“He 
is
" planning something to do with me, then?” said Harry "
swiftly. 
"“Did I say that?” said Phineas Nigellus, idly examining his silk "
"gloves. “Now, if you will excuse me, I "
have better things to do than to 
listen to adolescent agonizing.
 . . . Good day to you. . . .” 
And he strolled into his 
frame and out of sight. 
"“Fine, go then!” Harry bellowed "
at the empty frame. “And tell 
Dumbledore thanks for nothing!” 
The empty canvas remained si
"lent. Fuming, Harry dragged his "
"trunk back to the foot of his bed,"
 then threw himse
lf facedown upon 
"the moth-eaten covers, his eyes shut"
", his body heavy and aching. . . . "
He felt he had journeyed miles and 
miles. . . . It seemed impossible 
that less than twenty-four hours 
ago Cho Chang had been approach-
ing him under the mistletoe.
 . . . He was so tired. 
. . . He was scared to 
sleep . . . yet he did not know how 
long he could fight it. . . . Dum-
bledore had told him to stay. . . . 
That must mean he was allowed to 
sleep. . . . But he was scared. . . . 
What if it happened again . . . ? 
He was sinking into
 shadows. . . . 
It was as though a film in his he
ad had been waiting to start. He 
was walking down a deserted corrido
"r toward a plain black door, past "
"rough stone walls, torches, and an "
open doorway onto a flight of stone 
steps leading dow
nstairs on the left. . . . 
He reached the black door but coul
d not open it. . . . He stood gaz-
   497 "ing at it, desperate for entry. . . . So"
mething he wanted with all his heart 
lay beyond. . . . A prize beyond his dr
eams. . . . If only his scar would 
stop prickling . . . then 
he would be able to th
ink more clearly. . . . 
"“Harry,” said Ron’s voice, from "
"far, far away, “Mum says dinner’s "
"ready, but she’ll save you something if"
 you want to stay in bed. . . .” 
"Harry opened his eyes, but Ro"
n had already left the room. 
"He doesn’t want to be on his own with me,"
 Harry thought. 
Not after 
what he heard Moody say
 . . . 
He supposed none of them woul
d want him there anymore now 
that they knew what 
was inside him. . . . 
He would not go down to dinner; 
he would not inflict his company 
upon them. He turned over onto 
his other side and after a while 
"dropped back off to sleep, waking mu"
ch later in the early hours of the 
"morning, with his insides aching wi"
"th hunger, and Ron snoring in the "
next bed. Squinting around the r
oom he saw the dark outline of 
Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to 
Harry that Dumbledore had probably set Phineas Nigellus to watch 
"over him, in case he attacked somebody else. "
The feeling of being unclean intensif
ied. He half wished he had not 
obeyed Dumbledore and stayed. . . . If this was how life was going to 
"be in Grimmauld Place from now on, "
maybe he would be
 better off in 
Privet Drive after all. 
Everybody else spent the followin
g morning putting up Christmas 
decorations. Harry could not rememb
er Sirius ever being in such a 
good mood; he was actually singing 
"carols, apparently"
 delighted that 
he was to have company over Chri
stmas. Harry could hear his voice 
echoing up through the floor in 
the cold and empty drawing room 
"where he was sitting alone, watc"
hing the sky outside the windows 
"growing whiter, threatening snow, al"
l the time feeling a savage plea-
sure that he was giving
 the others the opport
unity to keep talking 
"about him, as they were bound "
to be doing. When he heard Mrs. 
 498 Weasley calling his name softly up 
the stairs around lunchtime he re-
treated farther upstairs and ignored her. 
It was around six o’clock in the 
evening that the doorbell rang and 
Mrs. Black started screaming agai
n. Assuming that Mundungus or 
some other Order member had come
" to call, Harry merely settled "
himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak the hip-
pogriff’s room where he was hiding
", trying to ignore how hungry he "
felt as he fed Buckbeak dead rats. It came as a slight shock when some-
body hammered hard on th
e door a few minutes later. 
"“I know you’re in there,” said "
Hermione’s voice. “Will you please 
come out? I want to talk to you.” 
“What are 
you
" doing here?” Harry asked her, pulling open the door, "
as Buckbeak resumed his scratching 
at the straw-strewn floor for any 
fragments of rat he might have dr
opped. “I thought you were skiing 
with your mum and dad.” 
"“Well, to tell the truth, skiing’s not "
really
" my thing,” said Hermi-"
one. “So I’ve come for Christmas.” There was snow in her hair and her 
face was pink with cold. “But don’t te
"ll Ron that, I told him it’s really "
good because he kept laughing so
" much. Anyway, Mum and Dad are "
"a bit disappointed, but I’ve told them that everyone who’s serious "
about the exams is staying at Hogwarts
 to study. They want me to do 
"well, they’ll understand. Anyway,” she "
"said briskly, “let"
’s go to your 
"bedroom, Ron’s mum’s lit a fire in th"
ere and she’s sent up sandwiches.” 
Harry followed her back to the se
cond floor. When he entered the 
bedroom he was rather surprised to
 see both Ron and Ginny waiting 
"for them, sitting on Ron’s bed. "
"“I came on the Knight Bus,” said Hermione airily, pulling off her "
jacket before Harry had time to 
speak. “Dumbledore told me what 
"had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to "
end officially before setting off. Um
bridge is already 
livid that you lot 
"disappeared right under her nose, ev"
en though Dumbledore told her  
   499 "Mr. Weasley was in St. Mungo’s, and "
he’d given you all permission to 
visit. So . . .” 
"She sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron looked up "
at Harry. 
“How’re you feeling?” asked Hermione. 
"“Fine,” said Harry stiffly. "
"“Oh, don’t lie, Harry,” she said "
impatiently. “Ron and Ginny say 
you’ve been hiding from everyone since you got back from St. 
Mungo’s.” 
"“They do, do they?” said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny. Ron "
looked down at his feet but Gi
nny seemed quite unabashed. 
"“Well, you have!” she said. “And "
you won’t look at
 any of us!” 
“It’s you lot who won’t look at
 me!” said Harry angrily. 
“Maybe you’re taking it in turns to look and keep missing each 
"other,” suggested Hermione, the co"
rners of her mouth twitching. 
"“Very funny,” snapped "
"Harry, turning away. "
"“Oh, stop feeling all misunderst"
"ood,” said Hermione sharply. "
"“Look, the others have told me what"
 you overheard last night on the 
Extendable Ears —” 
"“Yeah?” growled Harry, his hands deep"
 in his pockets as he watched 
the snow now falling thickly outside.
" “All been talking about me, have "
"you? Well, I’m getting "
used to it. . . .” 
“We wanted to talk 
"to you,"
" Harry,” said Ginny, “but as you’ve been "
hiding ever since we got back —” 
“I didn’t want anyone to talk to
" me,” said Harry, who was feeling "
more and more nettled. 
"“Well, that was a bit stupid of yo"
"u,” said Ginny angrily, “seeing as "
you don’t know anyone but me 
who’s been possessed by You-Know-
"Who, and I can tell "
you how it feels.” 
Harry remained quite still as the 
impact of these words hit him. 
Then he turned on th
e spot to face her. 
 500 "“I forgot,” he said. "
"“Lucky you,” said Ginny coolly. "
"“I’m sorry,” Harry said, and he me"
ant it. “So . . . so do you think 
"I’m being possessed, then?” "
"“Well, can you remember everyt"
hing you’ve been doing?” Ginny 
asked. “Are there big blank periods 
where you don’t know what you’ve 
been up to?” 
Harry racked his brains. 
"“No,” he said. "
"“Then You-Know-Who hasn’t ever possessed you,” said Ginny sim-"
"ply. “When he did it to me, I coul"
dn’t remember what I’d been doing 
for hours at a time. I’d find myself somewhere and not know how I 
got there.” 
"Harry hardly dared believe her, yet "
his heart was lightening almost 
in spite of himself. 
“That dream I had about your da
"d and the snake, though —” "
"“Harry, you’ve had these dreams before,” Hermione said. “You had "
flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.” 
"“This was different,” said Harry, sh"
aking his head. “I was inside 
that snake. It was like I 
was
 the snake. . . . What if Voldemort some-
how transported me 
to London — ?” 
"“One day,” said Hermione, soun"
"ding thoroughly exasperated, "
“you’ll read 
"Hogwarts, A History,"
 and perhaps that will remind you 
that you can’t Apparate or Disapp
arate inside Hogwarts. Even Volde-
mort couldn’t just make you fly 
"out of your dormitory, Harry.” "
"“You didn’t leave your bed, mate,”"
 said Ron. “I saw you thrashing 
around in your sleep about a minute b
efore we could wake you up. . . .” 
Harry started pacing up and down th
"e room again, thinking. What "
they were all saying was not only 
"comforting, it made sense. . . . "
Without really thinking he took a 
sandwich from the plate on the bed 
and crammed it hungrily 
into his mouth. . . . 
"I’m not the weapon after all,"
 thought Harry. His heart swelled with 
   501 "happiness and relief, and he felt like"
 joining in as they heard Sirius 
tramping past their door toward 
"Buckbeak’s room, singing “God Rest "
"Ye Merry, Hippogriffs” at the top of his voice. "
How could he have dreamed of retu
rning to Privet Drive for Christ-
"mas? Sirius’s delight at having the house full again, and especially at "
"having Harry back, was infectious. He"
 was no longer their sullen host 
of the summer; now he seemed dete
rmined that everyone should en-
"joy themselves as much, if not more, than they would have done at "
"Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly "
"in the run-up to Christmas Day, "
cleaning and decorating with their he
"lp, so that by the time they all "
went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognizable. The 
tarnished chandeliers were no long
er hung with cobwebs but with 
garlands of holly and gold and silver
 streamers; magical snow glittered 
"in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained "
by Mundungus and decorated with live
" fairies, blocked Sirius’s family "
tree from view; and even the stuffed elf heads on the hall wall wore Fa-
ther Christmas hats and beards. 
Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at 
the foot of his bed and Ron alread
"y halfway through opening his own, "
"rather larger, pile. "
"“Good haul this year,” he inform"
ed Harry through a cloud of pa-
per. “Thanks for the Broom Compas
"s, it’s excellent, beats Hermi-"
one’s — she’s got me a 
homework planner 
—” 
Harry sorted through his presents 
and found one with Hermione’s 
handwriting on it. She had given him
 too a book that resembled a di-
"ary, except that it said things like “"
Do it today or later you’ll pay
!” every 
time he opened a page. 
Sirius and Lupin had given Harry 
a set of excellent
 books entitled 
Practical Defensive Magic and It
"s Use Against the Dark Arts,"
 which had 
"superb, moving color illustrations of all the counterjinxes and hexes it "
described. Harry flicked through the 
first volume eagerly; he could see 
 502 it was going to be highly useful in
 his plans for the D.A. Hagrid had 
sent a furry brown wallet that had 
"fangs, which were presumably sup-"
"posed to be an antitheft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry "
putting any money in without gettin
g his fingers ripped off. Tonks’s 
"present was a small, working m"
"odel of a Firebolt, which Harry "
"watched fly around the room, wishing "
he still had his full-size version; 
Ron had given him an enormous box 
of Every-Flavor Beans; Mr. and 
Mrs. Weasley the usual hand-knitt
ed jumper and some mince pies; 
"and Dobby, a truly dreadful painti"
ng that Harry suspected had been 
done by the elf himself. He had just turned it upside down to see 
whether it looked better th
"at way when, with a loud "
"crack,"
 Fred and 
George Apparated at th
e foot of his bed. 
"“Merry Christmas,” said George. “D"
on’t go downstai
rs for a bit.” 
“Why not?” said Ron. 
"“Mum’s crying again,” said Fred heavily. “Percy sent back his "
Christmas jumper.” 
"“Without a note,” added George. "
“Hasn’t asked how Dad is or vis-
ited him or an
ything. . . .” 
"“We tried to comfort her,” said "
"Fred, moving around the bed to "
look at Harry’s portrait. “Told he
r Percy’s nothing more than a hu-
mongous pile of rat droppings —” 
"“— didn’t work,” said George, "
helping himself to a Chocolate 
Frog. “So Lupin took over. Best le
t him cheer her up before we go 
"down for breakfast, I reckon.” "
“What’s that supposed 
"to be anyway?” asked Fred, squinting at "
Dobby’s painting. “Looks like a 
gibbon with two black eyes.” 
"“It’s Harry!” said George, pointing at"
 the back of the picture. “Says 
so on the back!” 
"“Good likeness,” said Fred, gri"
nning. Harry threw his new home-
work diary at him; it hit the wall o
pposite and fell to the floor where it 
"said happily, “"
If you’ve dotted the i’s and crossed the t’s then you may do 
whatever you please
!” 
   503 They got up and dressed; they coul
d hear various inhabitants of the 
house calling “Merry Christmas” to
 each other. On their way down-
stairs they met Hermione. “Thank
"s for the book, Harry!” she said "
happily. “I’ve b
een wanting that 
New Theory of Numerology
 for ages! 
And that perfume is re
"ally unusual, Ron.” "
"“No problem,” said Ron. “Who’s that for anyway?” he added, nod-"
ding at the neatly wrappe
d present she was carrying. 
"“Kreacher,” said Hermione brightly. "
“It had better not be clothes!” said Ron warningly. “You know what 
"Sirius said, Kreacher knows too "
"much, we can’t set him free!” "
"“It isn’t clothes,” said Hermione, “although if I had my way I’d cer-"
tainly give him something to wear ot
"her than that filthy old rag. No, "
"it’s a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom.” "
"“What bedroom?” said Harry, droppi"
ng his voice to a whisper as 
they were passing the port
rait of Sirius’s mother. 
"“Well, Sirius says it’s not so much a bedroom, more a kind of — "
"den,"
” said Hermione. “Apparently he sl
eeps under the boiler in that 
cupboard off the kitchen.” 
Mrs. Weasley was the only person 
in the basement when they ar-
rived there. She was stan
ding at the stove and 
sounded as though she 
had a bad head cold when she wish
"ed them Merry Christmas, and "
they all averted their eyes. 
"“So, this is Kreacher’s bedroom?” said Ron, strolling over to a dingy "
door in the corner opposite the 
pantry which Harry had never seen 
open. 
"“Yes,” said Hermione, now soundi"
ng a little nervous. “Er . . . I 
think we’d better knock . . .” 
Ron rapped the door with his kn
uckles but there was no reply. 
“He must be sneaking around upst
"airs,” he said, and without fur-"
ther ado pulled 
open the door. “
Urgh.
” 
Harry peered inside. Most of the 
cupboard was taken up with a 
"very large and old-fashioned boiler, bu"
t in the foot’s space underneath 
 504 the pipes Kreacher had made himself
 something that looked like a 
nest. A jumble of assorted rags and 
smelly old blankets were piled on 
the floor and the small dent in 
the middle of it showed where 
Kreacher curled up to sleep ever
y night. Here and there among the 
material were stale bread crusts and 
moldy old bits of cheese. In a far 
corner glinted small objects and 
coins that Harry guessed Kreacher 
"had saved, magpielike, from Sirius’s"
" purge of the house, and he had "
also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that 
Sirius had thrown away over the 
summer. Their glass might be shat-
"tered, but still the little black-and-white people inside them peered "
"haughtily up at him, including — he"
 felt a little jolt in his stomach — 
"the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose "
trial he had witnessed in Dum-
bledore’s Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrang
e. By the looks 
"of it, hers was "
Kreacher’s favorite photograph; he ha
d placed it to the fore of all the 
others and had mended the glas
s clumsily with Spellotape. 
"“I think I’ll just leave his present here,” said Hermione, laying the "
package neatly in 
the middle of the depression 
in the rags and blankets 
"and closing the door quietly. “He’ll find it later, that’ll be fine. . . .” "
"“Come to think of it,” said Siri"
"us, emerging from the pantry carry-"
ing a large turkey as they clos
"ed the cupboard door, “has anyone "
actually seen Kr
eacher lately?” 
“I haven’t seen him since the night 
"we came back here,” said Harry. "
“You were ordering him
 out of the kitchen.” 
“Yeah . . .” said Sirius
", frowning. “You know, I "
think that’s the last 
"time I saw him, too. . . . He must be"
 hiding upstairs somewhere. . . .” 
"“He couldn’t have left, could he"
"?” said Harry. “I mean, when you "
"said ‘out,’ maybe he thought yo"
"u meant, get out of the house?” "
"“No, no, house-elves can’t leave un"
"less they’re given clothes, they’re "
"tied to their family’s house,” said Sirius. "
“They can leave the house if they 
"really want to,” Harry contra-"
"dicted him. “Dobby did, he left the "
Malfoys’ to give me warnings two 
"years ago. He had to punish himself afterward, but he still managed it.” "
   505 Sirius looked slightly
" disconcerted for a moment, then said, “I’ll "
"look for him later, I expe"
ct I’ll find him upstairs crying his eyes out 
"over my mother’s old bloomers or something. . . . Of course, he might "
have crawled into the airing cupboard and died. . . . But I mustn’t get 
my hopes up. . . .” 
"Fred, George, and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked "
reproachful. 
Once they had had their Christma
"s lunch, the Weasleys and Harry "
and Hermione were planning to pa
"y Mr. Weasley another visit, es-"
corted by Mad-Eye and Lupin. Mu
ndungus turned up in time for 
"Christmas pudding and trifle, having"
 managed to “borrow” a car for 
"the occasion, as the Underground di"
d not run on Christmas Day. The 
"car, which Harry doubted very much "
had been taken with the knowl-
"edge or consent of its owner, had "
had a similar Enlarging Spell put 
upon it as the Weasleys’ old Ford 
Anglia; although normally propor-
"tioned outside, ten people with Mu"
ndungus driving were able to fit 
into it quite comfortably. Mrs. We
asley hesitated at the point of get-
ting inside; Harry knew that her 
disapproval of Mundungus was bat-
tling with her dislike of travelin
g without magic; finally the cold 
outside and her children’s pleading 
"triumphed, and she settled herself "
into the backseat between Fred
 and Bill with good grace. 
The journey to St. Mungo’s was quit
"e quick, as there was very little "
traffic on the roads. A small trickle of witches and wizards were creep-
ing furtively up the otherwise desert
ed street to visit the hospital. 
Harry and the others got out of 
"the car, and Mundungus drove off "
around the corner to wait for them
; they strolled casually toward the 
window where the dummy in green 
"nylon stood, then, one by one, "
stepped through the glass. 
The reception area looked pleasan
tly festive: The crystal orbs that 
illuminated St. Mungo’s had been turned
 to red and gold so that they 
"became gigantic, glowing Christmas "
baubles; holly hung around every 
"doorway, and shining white Christma"
s trees covered in magical snow 
 506 and icicles glittered in every corner
", each topped with a gleaming gold "
star. It was less crowded than the la
"st time they had been there, al-"
though halfway across the room 
Harry found himself shunted aside 
by a witch with a walnut jammed up her left nostril. 
"“Family argument, eh?” smirked th"
e blonde witch behind the desk. 
“You’re the third I’ve se
en today . . . Spell Dama
"ge, fourth floor . . .” "
They found Mr. Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his 
turkey dinner on a tray in his lap and a rather sheepish expression on 
his face. 
"“Everything all right, Arthur?” aske"
"d Mrs. Weasley, after they had "
all greeted Mr. Weas
ley and handed over their presents. 
"“Fine, fine,” said Mr. Weasley, a "
little too heartily. “You — er — 
haven’t seen Healer Sm
"ethwyck, have you?” "
"“No,” said Mrs. Weasley suspiciously, “why?” "
"“Nothing, nothing,” said Mr. Weasle"
"y airily, starting to unwrap his "
"pile of gifts. “Well, everyone had "
a good day? What di
d you all get for 
"Christmas? Oh, "
Harry
 — this is absolutely 
wonderful
 —” 
For he had just opened Harry’s gift
 of fuse-wire and screwdrivers. 
Mrs. Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr. Weasley’s an-
"swer. As her husband leaned over to shake Harry’s hand, she peered at "
the bandaging unde
r his nightshirt. 
"“Arthur,” she said, with a snap "
"in her voice like a mousetrap, "
“you’ve had your bandages changed. Why have you had your ban-
"dages changed a day early, Arthur? Th"
ey told me they wouldn’t need 
doing until tomorrow.” 
"“What?” said Mr. Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the "
"bed covers higher up his chest. “No, no — it’s nothing — it’s — I —” "
He seemed to deflate under Mr
s. Weasley’s pi
ercing gaze. 
"“Well — now don’t get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an "
"idea. . . . He’s the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and "
very interested in . . . um . . . co
"mplementary medicine. . . . I mean,  "
   507 "some of these old Muggle remedies . . . well, they’re called "
"stitches,"
"Molly, and they work very we"
ll on — on Mu
ggle wounds —” 
Mrs. Weasley let out an omin
ous noise somewhere between a 
shriek and a snarl. Lupin strolled aw
ay from the bed and over to the 
"werewolf, who had no visitors and wa"
s looking rather wistfully at the 
crowd around Mr. Weasley; Bill muttered something about getting 
himself a cup of tea and Fred and Ge
"orge leapt up to accompany him, "
grinning. 
"“Do you mean to tell me,” said "
"Mrs. Weasley, her voice growing "
louder with every word and appare
ntly unaware that her fellow visi-
"tors were scurrying for cover, “tha"
t you have been messing about with 
Muggle remedies?” 
"“Not messing about, Mo"
"lly, dear,” said Mr. "
Weasley imploringly. 
“It was just — just something Py
"e and I thought we’d try — only, "
"most unfortunately — well, with th"
ese particular kinds of wounds — 
it doesn’t seem to work as
 well as we’d hoped —” 
“
Meaning
?” 
"“Well . . . well, I don’t know "
whether you know what — what 
stitches are?” 
“It sounds as though you’ve been trying to sew your skin back to-
"gether,” said Mrs. Weasley with a "
"snort of mirthless laughter, “but "
"even you, Arthur, wouldn’t be "
that
 stupid —” 
"“I fancy a cup of tea too,” sa"
"id Harry, jumping to his feet. "
"Hermione, Ron, and Ginny almost "
sprinted to the door with him. 
"As it swung closed behind them, they heard Mrs. Weasley shriek, "
"“WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT"
’S THE GENERAL IDEA?” 
"“Typical Dad,” said Ginny, shaking "
her head as they set off up the 
corridor. “Stitches . 
. . I ask you . . .” 
"“Well, you know, they do work well"
" on non-magical wounds,” said "
Hermione fairly. “I suppose somethin
g in that snake’s venom dissolves 
them or something. . . . I wo
nder where the tearoom is?” 
 508 "“Fifth floor,” said Harry, rememb"
ering the sign over the Welcome 
Witch’s desk. 
They walked along the corridor 
through a set of double doors and 
found a rickety staircase lined with
 more portraits 
of brutal-looking 
"Healers. As they climbed it, the va"
"rious Healers called out to them, di-"
agnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies. Ron was 
seriously affronted when a medieval 
wizard called out that he clearly 
had a bad case of
 spattergroit. 
“And what’s that supposed to be?” 
"he asked angrily, as the Healer "
pursued him through six more portra
"its, shoving the occupants out of "
the way. 
“’Tis a most grievous affliction of
" the skin, young master, that will "
leave you pockmarked and more grue
some even than you are now —” 
"“Watch who you’re calling gruesome!” said Ron, his ears turning red. "
"“The only remedy is to take the liver of a toad, bind it tight about "
"your throat, stand naked by the full "
moon in a barrel of eels’ eyes —” 
“I have not got spattergroit!” 
“But the unsightly blemishes upon
" your visage, young master —” "
“They’re freckles!” said Ron furiously. “Now get back in your own 
picture and leave me alone!” 
"He rounded on the others, who "
were all keeping determinedly 
straight faces. 
“What floor’s this?” 
"“I think it’s the fifth,” said Hermione. "
"“Nah, it’s the fourth,” said Harry, “one more —” "
But as he stepped onto the landing 
"he came to an abrupt halt, star-"
ing at the small window set into the double doors that marked the 
start of a corridor signposted 
spell damage
. A man was peering out 
at them all with his nose pressed ag
ainst the glass. He had wavy blond 
"hair, bright blue eyes, and a broa"
d vacant smile that revealed daz-
zlingly white teeth. 
   509 "“Blimey!” said Ron, also"
 staring at the man. 
"“Oh my goodness,” said Hermione "
"suddenly, sounding breathless. "
“Professor Lockhart!” 
Their ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher pushed open the 
"doors and moved toward them, wearing a long lilac dressing gown. "
"“Well, hello there!” he said. “I "
"expect you’d like my autograph, "
would you?” 
"“Hasn’t changed much, has he?”"
" Harry muttered to Ginny, who "
grinned. 
"“Er — how are you, Professor?” said"
" Ron, sounding slightly guilty. "
It had been Ron’s malfunctioning 
wand that had damaged Professor 
Lockhart’s memory so badly that he ha
"d landed here in the first place, "
"though, as Lockhart had been attemp"
ting to permanently wipe Harry 
"and Ron’s memories at the time, "
Harry’s sympathy was limited. 
"“I’m very well indeed, thank you!"
"” said Lockhart exuberantly, "
pulling a rather battered peacock-fe
"ather quill from his pocket. “Now, "
how many autographs would you 
like? I can do joined-up writing 
"now, you know!” "
“Er — we don’t want any at the mo
"ment, thanks,” said Ron, rais-"
"ing his eyebrows at Harry, who asked, “Professor, should you be wan-"
dering around the corridors? 
Shouldn’t you be in a ward?” 
The smile faded slowly 
from Lockhart’s face. For a few moments he 
"gazed intently at Harry, then he said, “Haven’t we met?” "
"“Er . . . yeah, we have,” said Harry"
. “You used to teach us at Hog-
"warts, remember?” "
"“Teach?” repeated Lockhart, looking faintly unsettled. “Me? Did I?” "
And then the smile reappeared upon
 his face so suddenly it was 
rather alarming. “Taugh
"t you everything you know, I expect, did I? "
"Well, how about those autographs, "
"then? Shall we say a round dozen, "
you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left 
out!” 
 510 But just then a head poked out of
 a door at the far end of the cor-
"ridor and a voice said, “Gilderoy, you naughty boy, where have you "
wandered off to?” 
A motherly looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came 
bustling up the corrid
"or, smiling warmly at Harry and the others. "
"“Oh Gilderoy, you’ve got visitors! How "
"lovely,"
 and on Christmas 
"Day too! Do you know, he "
never
" gets visitors, poor lamb, and I can’t "
"think why, he’s such "
"a sweetie, aren’t you?” "
“We’re doing autographs!” Gilderoy told the Healer with another 
glittering smile. “They want loads 
"of them, won’t take no for an an-"
swer! I just hope we’ve 
got enough photographs!” 
"“Listen to him,” said the Healer, "
taking Lockhart’s arm and beam-
ing fondly at him as though he we
re a precocious two-year-old. “He 
was rather well known a few years ag
o; we very much hope that this 
liking for giving autogr
aphs is a sign that 
his memory might be com-
"ing back a little bit. Will you step this way? He’s in a closed ward, you "
"know, he must have slipped out whil"
e I was bringing in the Christmas 
"presents, the door’s usually kept lock"
ed . . . not that he’s dangerous! 
"But,” she lowered her voice to a whis"
"per, “bit of a danger to himself, "
"bless him. . . . Doesn’t know who he is, you see, wanders off and can’t "
remember how to get back. . . . It 
is
 nice of you to have come to see 
him —” 
"“Er,” said Ron, gesturing uselessl"
"y at the floor above, “actually, "
we were just — er —” 
But the Healer was smiling expect
"antly at them, and Ron’s feeble "
mutter of “going to have a cup of 
tea” trailed away into nothingness. 
They looked at one another rather
 hopelessly and then followed Lock-
hart and his Healer 
along the corridor. 
"“Let’s not stay long,” Ron said quietly. "
The Healer pointed her wand at
 the door of the Janus Thickey 
ward and muttered “
Alohomora.
” The door swung open and she led  
   511 "the way inside, keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoy’s arm until she had "
settled him into an armc
hair beside his bed. 
“This is our long-term resident wa
"rd,” she informed Harry, Ron, "
"Hermione, and Ginny in a low voice. “For permanent spell damage, "
"you know. Of course, with intensiv"
e remedial potions and charms and 
"a bit of luck, we can produce some improvement. . . . Gilderoy does "
seem to be getting back some sens
"e of himself, and we’ve seen a real "
"improvement in Mr. Bode, he seems to be regaining the power of "
"speech very well, though he isn’t sp"
eaking any language we recognize 
"yet. . . . Well, I must finish givi"
"ng out the Christmas presents, I’ll "
leave you all to chat. . . .” 
Harry looked around; this ward bo
re unmistakable signs of being a 
permanent home to its residents. 
They had many more personal ef-
fects around their beds than in Mr
. Weasley’s ward; 
the wall around 
"Gilderoy’s headboard, for instance, "
was papered with pictures of him-
"self, all beaming toothil"
y and waving at the ne
w arrivals. He had au-
tographed many of them to himself 
"in disjointed, childish writing. "
The moment he had been deposite
"d in his chair by the Healer, "
Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of ph
"otographs toward him, seized a "
"quill, and started signin"
g them all feverishly. 
"“You can put them in envelopes,” "
"he said to Ginny, throwing the "
signed pictures into her lap one by 
one as he finished them. “I am not 
"forgotten, you know, no, "
I still receive a very great deal of fan mail. 
. . . Gladys Gudgeon writes 
weekly.
 . . . I just wish I knew 
why.
 . . .” 
"He paused, looking faintly puzzled,"
 then beamed again and returned 
to his signing with renew
ed vigor. “I suspect 
it is simply my good 
looks. . . .” 
"A sallow-skinned, mournful-looking"
 wizard lay in the bed oppo-
"site, staring at the ceiling; he wa"
s mumbling to himself and seemed 
quite unaware of anything around
 him. Two beds along was a woman 
whose entire head was covered in 
fur; Harry remembered something  
 512 similar happening to Hermione duri
"ng their second year, although "
"fortunately the damage, in her ca"
"se, had not been permanent. At the "
far end of the ward flowery curtai
ns had been drawn around two beds 
to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy. 
"“Here you are, Agnes,” said the He"
aler brightly to the furry-faced 
"woman, handing her a small pile of"
" Christmas presents. “See, not for-"
"gotten, are you? And your son’s sent an"
" owl to say he’s visiting tonight, "
"so that’s nice, isn’t it?” "
Agnes gave severa
l loud barks. 
"“And look, Broderick, you’ve been "
sent a potted plant and a lovely 
calendar with a different fancy hi
"ppogriff for each month, they’ll "
"brighten things up, won’t they?” said"
" the Healer, bustling along to the "
"mumbling man, setting a rather ugly plant with long, swaying tenta-"
cles on the bedside cabinet and fixing
 the calendar to the wall with her 
"wand. “And — oh, Mrs. Longbott"
"om, are you leaving already?” "
Harry’s head spun round. The curt
ains had been drawn back from 
the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking 
back down the aisle between the beds
: a formidable-looking old witch 
wearing a long green dr
"ess, a moth-eaten fox "
"fur, and a pointed hat "
decorated with what was unmistakably
" a stuffed vulture and, trailing "
behind her looking thor
oughly depressed — 
Neville.
With a sudden rush of understa
"nding, Harry realized who the "
people in the end beds
 must be. He cast around wildly for some 
means of distracting the others so 
that Neville could leave the ward 
"unnoticed and unquestioned, but Ron had looked up at the sound of "
"the name “Longbottom” too, and "
before Harry could stop him had 
"called, “"
Neville
!” 
Neville jumped and co
wered as though a bullet had narrowly 
missed him. 
"“It’s us, Neville!” said Ron bright"
"ly, getting to his feet. “Have you "
seen? Lockhart’s here! Who’
ve you been visiting?” 
   513 "“Friends of yours, Neville, dear?”"
 said Neville’s grandmother gra-
"ciously, bearing down upon them all. "
Neville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world 
but here. A dull purple flush was creeping up his plump face and he 
was not making eye contact with any of them. 
"“Ah, yes,” said his grandmother, "
looking closely at Harry and stick-
"ing out a shriveled, clawlike hand fo"
"r him to shake. “Yes, yes, I know "
"who you are, of course. Neville speaks most highly of you.” "
"“Er — thanks,” said Harry, shaking "
hands. Neville did not look at 
"him, but stared at his own feet, the co"
lor deepening in his face all the 
while. 
"“And you two are clearly Weasleys,” Mrs. Longbottom continued, "
"proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn. “Yes, I know "
"your parents — not well, of course — but fine people, fine people . . . "
and you must be Hermione Granger?” 
Hermione looked rather startled 
that Mrs. Longbottom knew her 
"name, but shook hands all the same. "
"“Yes, Neville’s told me all abou"
t you. Helped him out of a few 
"sticky spots, haven’t you? He’s a "
"good boy,” she said, casting a sternly "
appraising look down her rather bony 
"nose at Neville, “but he hasn’t "
"got his father’s talent, I’m afraid to say. . . .” And she jerked her head "
in the direction of the two beds at
 the end of the wa
"rd, so that the "
stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly. 
"“What?” said Ron, looking amaz"
ed (Harry wanted to stamp on 
"Ron’s foot, but that sort of thing "
was much harder to bring off unno-
ticed when you were wearing jeans ra
ther than robes). “Is that your 
dad
" down the end, Neville?” "
“What’s this?” said Mrs. Longbo
ttom sharply. “Haven’t you told 
your friends about your
" parents, Neville?” "
"Neville took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling, and shook "
"his head. Harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone,  "
 514 but he could not think of any wa
y of helping Neville out of the 
situation. 
"“Well, it’s nothing to"
 be ashamed of!” said
 Mrs. Longbottom an-
grily. “You should be 
"proud,"
" Neville, "
proud
! They didn’t give their 
"health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them, "
you know!” 
"“I’m not ashamed,” said Neville very faintly, still looking anywhere "
but at Harry and the others. Ron was 
now standing on tiptoe to look 
over at the inhabita
nts of the two beds. 
"“Well, you’ve got a funny way of "
showing it!” said Mrs. Longbot-
"tom. “My son and his wife,” she sa"
"id, turning haughtily to Harry, "
"Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, “were tortured into insanity by You-"
Know-Who’s 
followers.” 
Hermione and Ginny both clapped 
their hands over their mouths. 
Ron stopped craning his neck to catc
h a glimpse of Neville’s parents 
and looked mortified. 
"“They were Aurors, you know, and "
very well respected within the 
"Wizarding community,” Mrs. Longbo"
"ttom went on. “Highly gifted, "
the pair of them. 
"I — yes, Alice dear, what is it?” "
Neville’s mother had come edging do
wn the ward in her nightdress. 
"She no longer had the plump, ha"
ppy-looking face Ha
rry had seen in 
Moody’s old photograph of the orig
inal Order of the Phoenix. Her 
"face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge, and her hair, "
"which had turned white, was wisp"
y and dead-looking. She did not 
"seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made "
"timid motions toward Neville, holdin"
g something in her outstretched 
hand. 
"“Again?” said Mrs. Longbottom, "
sounding slightly weary. “Very 
"well, Alice dear, very well"
" — Neville, take it, wh"
atever it is. . . .” 
But Neville had already stretche
"d out his hand, into which his "
mother dropped an empty Droo
bles Blowing Gum wrapper. 
"“Very nice, dear,” said Neville’s grandmother in a falsely cheery "
   515 "voice, patting his mother on the "
"shoulder. But Neville said quietly, "
“Thanks Mum.” 
"His mother tottered away, back up"
" the ward, humming to herself. "
"Neville looked around at the others, "
"his expression defiant, as though "
"daring them to laugh, but Harry di"
d not think he’d ever found any-
thing less funny in his life. 
"“Well, we’d better get back,” si"
"ghed Mrs. Longbottom, drawing on "
long green gloves. “Very 
"nice to have met you all. Neville, put that "
"wrapper in the bin, she must have "
given you enough of them to paper 
your bedroom by now. . . .” 
"But as they left, Harry was sure he"
 saw Neville slip the wrapper into 
his pocket. 
The door closed behind them. 
"“I never knew,” said Hermione, who looked tearful. "
"“Nor did I,” said Ro"
n rather hoarsely. 
"“Nor me,” whispered Ginny. "
They all looked at Harry. 
"“I did,” he said glumly. “Dumbl"
edore told me but I promised I 
wouldn’t mention it . . . that’s wh
at Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to 
"Azkaban for, using the Cruciatus Curs"
e on Neville’s parents until they 
lost their minds.” 
“Bellatrix Lestrange did that?”
" whispered Hermione, horrified. "
“That woman Kreacher’s got 
a photo of in his den?” 
"There was a long silence, broken by Lockhart’s angry voice. “Look, "
I didn’t learn joined-up writ
"ing for nothing, you know!” "
"reacher, it transpired, had been lu"
rking in the attic. Sirius said 
"he had found him up there, covered in dust, no doubt looking "
for more relics of the Black family
 to hide in his cupboard. Though 
Sirius seemed satisfied with this st
"ory, it made Harry uneasy. Kreacher "
seemed to be in a better mood on 
"his reappearance, his bitter mutter-"
"ing had subsided somewhat, and he "
submitted to orders more docilely 
"than usual, though once or twic"
e Harry caught the house-elf staring 
"avidly at him, always looking qu"
ickly away when he saw that Harry 
had noticed. 
Harry did not mention his vague susp
"icions to Sirius, whose cheer-"
fulness was evaporating fast now that
 Christmas was over. As the date 
of their departure back 
to Hogwarts drew nearer
", he became more and "
more prone to what Mrs. Weasley call
"ed “fits of the sullens,” in which "
he would become taciturn and gr
"umpy, often withdrawing to Buck-"
beak’s room for hours at a time. Hi
"s gloom seeped through the house, "
oozing under doorways like some noxiou
"s gas, so that all of them be-"
came infected by it. 
Harry did not want to leave Sirius all alone again with only Kreacher 
K 
  517 "for company. In fact, for the first ti"
"me in his life, he was not looking "
forward to returning to Hogwarts. 
Going back to school would mean 
placing himself once again under 
"the tyranny of Dolores Umbridge, "
who had no doubt managed to force 
through another dozen decrees in 
their absence. Then there was no 
Quidditch to look forward to now 
that he had been bann
ed; there was every like
lihood that their burden 
of homework would increase as th
e exams drew even nearer; Dumble-
dore remained as remote as ever; in 
"fact, if it had not been for the D.A., "
Harry felt he might have gone to Sirius and begged him to let him leave 
Hogwarts and remain 
in Grimmauld Place. 
"Then, on the very last day of "
"the holidays, something happened "
that made Harry positively 
dread his return to school. 
"“Harry dear,” said Mrs. Weasley,"
 poking her head into his and 
"Ron’s bedroom, where the pair of "
them were playin
g wizard chess 
"watched by Hermione, Ginny, and "
"Crookshanks, “could you come "
down to the kitchen? Professor Snape would like a word with you.” 
Harry did not immediately register 
what she had said; one of his 
castles was engaged in a violent tussl
"e with a pawn of Ron’s, and he "
was egging it on enthusiastically. 
“Squash him — 
"squash him,"
" he’s only a pawn, you idiot — sorry, "
"Mrs. Weasley, what did you say?” "
"“Professor Snape, dear. In the "
kitchen. He’d like a word.” 
Harry’s mouth fell open in horror
". He looked around at Ron, "
"Hermione, and Ginny, all of whom "
were gaping back at him. Crook-
"shanks, whom Hermione had been rest"
raining with difficulty for the 
"past quarter of an hour, leapt gleefully upon the board and set the "
pieces running for cove
"r, squealing at the "
top of their voices. 
“Snape?” said Harry blankly. 
“
Professor
" Snape, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley reprovingly. “Now come "
"on, quickly, he says he can’t stay long.” "
"“What’s he want with you?” said Ron, looking unnerved as Mrs. "
Weasley withdrew from the room. 
 518 "“You haven’t done anything, have you?” "
"“No!” said Harry indignantly, rackin"
g his brains to 
think what he 
could have done that would make 
Snape pursue hi
m to Grimmauld 
Place. Had his last piece of 
homework perhaps earned a T? 
He pushed open the kitchen door a mi
nute or two later to find Sir-
ius and Snape both seated at the lo
"ng kitchen table, glaring in oppo-"
site directions. The silence betw
een them was heavy with mutual 
dislike. A letter lay open on 
the table in front of Sirius. 
"“Er,” said Harry to announce his presence. "
"Snape looked around at him, his "
face framed between curtains of 
greasy black hair. 
"“Sit down, Potter.” "
"“You know,” said Sirius loudly, leaning back on his rear chair legs "
"and speaking to the ceiling, “I think "
I’d prefer it if you didn’t give or-
"ders here, Snape. It’s my house, you see.” "
An ugly flush suffused Snape’s pallid face. Harry sat down in a chair 
"beside Sirius, facing Snape across the table. "
"“I was supposed to see you alone, "
"Potter,” said Snape, the familiar "
"sneer curling his mouth, “but Black —” "
"“I’m his godfather,” said "
"Sirius, louder than ever. "
“I am here on Dumbledore’s orders
",” said Snape, whose voice, by "
"contrast, was becoming more and more quietly waspish, “but by all "
"means stay, Black, I know you li"
ke to feel . . . involved.” 
“What’s that supposed to mean?” sa
"id Sirius, letting his chair fall "
back onto all four legs with a loud bang. 
“Merely that I am sure you must fe
el — ah — frustrated by the fact 
that you can do nothing 
"useful,"
” Snape laid a delicate stress on the 
"word, “for the Order.” "
It was Sirius’s turn to flush. Snape’s lip curled in triumph as he 
turned to Harry. 
“The headmaster has sent me to tell
" you, Potter, that it is his wish "
for you to study Occlumency this term.” 
  519 “Study what?” said Harry blankly. 
Snape’s sneer became more pronounced. 
"“Occlumency, Potter. The magical "
defense of the mind against ex-
ternal penetration. An obscure bran
"ch of magic, but a highly useful "
one. 
Harry’s heart began to pump very 
fast indeed. Defense against ex-
"ternal penetration? But he was not being possessed, they had all "
agreed on that. . . . 
“Why do I have to study Occlu — thing?” he blurted out. 
“Because the headmaster thinks
" it a good idea,” said Snape "
smoothly. “You will receive private 
"lessons once a week, but you will "
"not tell anybody what you are doing, least of all Dolores Umbridge. "
You understand?” 
"“Yes,” said Harry. “Who’s going to be teaching me?” "
Snape raised an eyebrow. 
"“I am,” he said. "
Harry had the horrible sens
ation that his insides were melting. Ex-
tra lessons with Snape — what on 
earth had he done to deserve this? 
He looked quickly around at Sirius for support. 
“Why can’t Dumbledore teach Ha
rry?” asked Sirius aggressively. 
“Why you?” 
“I suppose because it is a headmaster’s privilege to delegate less en-
"joyable tasks,” said Snape silkily. "
“I assure you I did not beg for the 
job.” He got to his feet. “I will expect you at six o’clock on Monday 
"evening, Potter. My office. If anybody asks, you are taking Remedial "
Potions. Nobody who has seen you in
 my classes could deny you need 
them.” 
"He turned to leave, "
his black traveling cloa
k billowing behind him. 
"“Wait a moment,” said "
"Sirius, sitting up stra"
ighter in his chair. 
"Snape turned back to face them, sneering. "
"“I am in rather a hurry, Black . . "
". unlike you, I do not have unlim-"
ited leisure time. . . .” 
 520 "“I’ll get to the point, then,” said Sirius, standing up. He was rather "
"taller than Snape who, Harry noticed, "
had balled his fist
 in the pocket 
of his cloak over what 
Harry was sure was the handle of his wand. “If 
I hear you’re using th
ese Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard 
"time, you’ll have me to answer to.” "
"“How touching,” Snape sneered. “But"
 surely you have noticed that 
Potter is very li
ke his father?” 
"“Yes, I have,” said Sirius proudly. "
"“Well then, you’ll know he’s so arrogant that criticism simply "
"bounces off him,” Snape said sleekly. "
Sirius pushed his chair roughly as
ide and strode around the table 
"toward Snape, pulling out his wand as he went; Snape whipped out "
"his own. They were squaring up to each other, Sirius looking livid, "
"Snape calculating, his eyes darting fr"
om Sirius’s wand tip to his face. 
"“Sirius!” said Harry loudly, but Sirius appeared not to hear him. "
"“I’ve warned you, "
"Snivellus,"
”
"said Sirius, his face "
barely a foot from 
"Snape’s, “I don’t care if Dumbledore thinks you’ve reformed, I know "
better —” 
"“Oh, but why don’t you tell him so?” whispered Snape. “Or are you "
afraid he might not take the advice of a man who has been hiding in-
side his mother’s house for 
six months very seriously?” 
"“Tell me, how is Lucius Malfoy th"
ese days? I expect he’s delighted 
"his lapdog’s working at Hogwarts, isn’t he?” "
"“Speaking of dogs,” said Snape sof"
"tly, “did you know that Lucius "
Malfoy recognized you last time yo
u risked a little jaunt outside? 
"Clever idea, Black, getting yourself "
seen on a safe station platform . . . 
gave you a cast-iron excuse not to
" leave your hidey-hole in future, "
didn’t it?” 
Sirius raised his wand. 
"“NO!” Harry yelled, vaulting over the table and trying to get in be-"
"tween them, “Sirius, don’t —” "
  521 “Are you calling me a coward?” roar
"ed Sirius, trying to push Harry "
"out of the way, but Harry would not budge. "
"“Why, yes, I suppose "
"I am,” said Snape. "
"“Harry — get — out — of — it!” snarled Sirius, pushing him out "
of the way with his free hand. 
The kitchen door opened and the 
"entire Weasley family, plus "
"Hermione, came inside, all lookin"
"g very happy, with Mr. Weasley "
walking proudly in their midst dre
ssed in a pair of striped pajamas 
covered by a mackintosh. 
“Cured!” he announced brightly 
to the kitchen at large. “Com-
pletely cured!” 
He and all the other Weasleys froze 
"on the threshold, gazing at the "
"scene in front of them, which was al"
"so suspended in mid-action, both "
Sirius and Snape looking toward th
e door with their wands pointing 
"into each other’s faces and Harry immobile between them, a hand "
"stretched out to each of them, trying to force them apart. "
"“Merlin’s beard,” said Mr. Weasley,"
" the smile sliding off his face, "
“what’s going on here?” 
Both Sirius and Snape lowered th
eir wands. Harry looked from one 
"to the other. Each wore an expression of utmost contempt, yet the "
unexpected entrance of so many wi
tnesses seemed to have brought 
them to their senses. Snape pocket
ed his wand and swept back across 
"the kitchen, passing the Weasleys"
 without comment. At the door he 
looked back. 
“Six o’clock Monday 
"evening, Potter.” "
He was gone. Sirius glared af
"ter him, his wand at his side. "
“But what’s been going on?” asked Mr. Weasley again. 
"“Nothing, Arthur,” said Sirius, wh"
o was breathing heavily as though 
he had just run a long distance. “Jus
t a friendly little
 chat between two 
old school friends. . . .” With what
 looked like an 
"enormous effort, he "
smiled. “So . . . you’re cured? That’s
" great news, really great. . . .” "
 522 "“Yes, isn’t it?” said Mrs. Weasley,"
 leading her husband forward into 
"a chair. “Healer Smethwyck worked his magic in the end, found an "
antidote to whatever that snake’s got 
"in its fangs, and Arthur’s learned "
"his lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine, "
"haven’t you, dear"
?” she 
"added, rather menacingly. "
"“Yes, Molly dear,” said"
 Mr. Weasley meekly. 
That night’s meal should have
 been a cheerful one with Mr. 
Weasley back amongst th
em; Harry could tell Si
rius was trying to 
"make it so, yet when his godfathe"
r was not forcing himself to laugh 
loudly at Fred and George’s jokes 
"or offering everyone more food, his "
"face fell back into a moody, broodi"
ng expression. Harry was separated 
from him by Mundungus and Mad-Ey
"e, who had dropped in to offer "
Mr. Weasley their congratulations; he 
"wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell "
him that he should not listen to 
"a word Snape said, that Snape was "
goading him deliberately and that th
e rest of them did not think Sir-
ius was a coward for doing as Dumb
ledore told him and remaining in 
"Grimmauld Place, but he had no o"
"pportunity to do so, and wondered "
"occasionally, eyeing the ugly look "
"on Sirius’s face, whether he would "
have dared to even if he had the chance. Instead he told Ron and 
Hermione under his voice about ha
ving to take Occlumency lessons 
with Snape. 
“Dumbledore wants to stop you ha
ving those dreams about Volde-
"mort,” said Hermione at once. “We"
"ll, you won’t be sorry not to have "
"them anymore, will you?” "
“Extra lessons with Snape?” said Ro
"n, sounding aghast. “I’d rather "
have the nightmares!” 
They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following 
"day, escorted once again by Tonks "
"and Lupin, both of whom were eat-"
ing breakfast in the 
"kitchen when Harry, Ron,"
 and Hermione arrived 
there next morning. The adults seem
ed to have been midway through 
a whispered conversation when the 
door opened; all of them looked 
around hastily and fell silent. 
  523 After a hurried breakfast they pulled on jackets and scarves against 
the chilly gray January morning. 
Harry had an unpleasant constricted 
sensation in his chest; he did not 
want to say good-bye to Sirius. He 
had a bad feeling about this partin
g; he did not know when they 
would next see each other and felt th
at it was incumbent upon him to 
say something to Sirius to stop 
him doing anything stupid — Harry 
was worried that Snape’s accusation 
of cowardice had stung Sirius so 
badly he might even now be planni
ng some foolhardy trip beyond 
Grimmauld Place. Before he could t
"hink of what to say, however, Sir-"
ius had beckoned 
him to his side. 
"“I want you to take this,” he said"
" quietly, thrusting a badly wrapped "
package roughly the size of a pape
rback book into Harry’s hands. 
“What is it?” Harry asked. 
“A way of letting me know if Sn
"ape’s giving you a hard time. No, "
"don’t open it in here!” said Sirius, "
"with a wary look at Mrs. Weasley, "
who was trying to persuade the twins to wear hand-knitted mittens. “I 
doubt Molly would approve — but I wa
nt you to use it if you need 
"me, all right?” "
"“Okay,” said Harry, stowing the pack"
age away in the inside pocket 
"of his jacket, but he knew he woul"
d never use whatever it was. It 
"would not be he, Harry, who lured Si"
"rius from his place of safety, no "
matter how foully Snape treated 
him in their forthcoming Occlu-
mency classes. 
"“Let’s go, then,” said Sirius, clap"
ping Harry on the shoulder and 
"smiling grimly, and before Harry co"
"uld say anything else, they were "
"heading upstairs, stopping before th"
e heavily chained and bolted front 
"door, surrounded by Weasleys. "
"“Good-bye, Harry, take "
"care,” said Mrs. We"
"asley, hugging him. "
"“See you Harry, and keep an eye out for snakes for me!” said Mr. "
"Weasley genially, shaking his hand. "
"“Right — yeah,” said "
Harry distractedly. It wa
s his last chance to 
"tell Sirius to be careful; he turned, looked into his godfather’s face and "
 524 "opened his mouth to speak, but befo"
re he could do so Sirius was giv-
"ing him a brief, one-armed hug. He "
"said gruffly, “Look after yourself, "
"Harry,” and next moment Harry fo"
und himself being shunted out 
"into the icy winter air, with Tonks (today heavily disguised as a tall, "
tweedy woman with iron-gray hair) chivvying him down the steps. 
The door of number twelve slam
med shut behind them. They fol-
lowed Lupin down the front steps. As
" he reached the pavement, Harry "
looked around. Number twelve was 
shrinking rapidly 
as those on ei-
"ther side of it stretched sideways, "
squeezing it out of sight; one blink 
"later, it had gone. "
"“Come on, the quicker we get on the bus the better,” said Tonks, "
and Harry thought there was nervous
ness in the glance she threw 
around the square. Lupin 
flung out his right arm. 
BANG. 
"A violently purple, triple-decker bus had appeared out of thin air in "
"front of them, narrowly avoiding th"
"e nearest lamppost, which jumped "
backward out of its way. 
"A thin, pimply, jug-eared youth in a purple uniform leapt down "
onto the pavement and sa
"id, “Welcome to the —” "
"“Yes, yes, we know, thank you,” said Tonks swiftly. “On, on, get "
on — 
"And she shoved Harry forward toward the steps, past the conduc-"
"tor, who goggled at Harry as he passed. "
“’Ere — it’s ’Arry — !” 
"“If you shout his name I will curse you into oblivion,” muttered "
"Tonks menacingly, now shunting "
Ginny and Hermione forward. 
“I’ve always wanted to go on this
" thing,” said Ron happily, joining "
Harry on board and looking around. 
It had been evening th
e last time Harry had tr
aveled by Knight Bus 
and its three decks had been full of 
"brass bedsteads. Now, in the early "
"morning, it was crammed with an assortment of mismatched chairs  "
  525 grouped haphazardly around window
s. Some of these appeared to 
have fallen over when the bus stop
ped abruptly in 
Grimmauld Place; 
"a few witches and wizards were still getting to their feet, grumbling, "
and somebody’s shopping bag had slid
 the length of 
the bus; an un-
"pleasant mixture of frog spawn, cockroaches, and custard creams was "
scattered all ov
er the floor. 
“Looks like we’ll have to split up
",” said Tonics briskly, looking "
"around for empty chairs. “Fred, Ge"
"orge, and Ginny, if you just take "
those seats at the back . . . Re
mus can stay with you. . . .” 
"She, Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded up to the very top deck, "
where there were two chairs at the 
very front of the bus and two at the 
"back. Stan Shunpike, the conducto"
"r, followed Harry and Ron eagerly "
to the back. Heads turned as Harry
" passed and when he sat down, he "
saw all the faces flick back to the front again. 
As Harry and Ron handed Stan elev
"en Sickles each, the bus set off "
"again, swaying ominously. It ru"
"mbled around Grimmauld Square, "
"weaving on and off the pavement, then, with another tremendous "
"BANG, they were all flung backward"
; Ron’s chair toppled right over 
"and Pigwidgeon, who had been on his "
"lap, burst out of his cage and "
flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where he fluttered 
down upon Hermione’s shoulder in
"stead. Harry, who had narrowly "
avoided falling by seizing a candle 
"bracket, looked out of the window: "
they were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway. 
"“Just outside Birmingham,” said"
" Stan happily, answering Harry’s "
unasked question as Ron struggled 
up from the floor. “You keepin’ 
"well, then, ’Arry? I seen your name in the paper loads over the summer, "
but it weren’t never nuffin
"k very nice. . . . I said to Ern, I said, ‘’e didn’t "
seem like a nutter when we met ’i
"m, just goes to show, dunnit?’” "
He handed over their tickets and 
"continued to gaze, enthralled, at "
Harry; apparently Stan did not care
 how nutty somebody was if they 
were famous enough to 
be in the paper. The Knight Bus swayed  
 526 "alarmingly, overtaking a line of cars"
 on the inside. Looking toward the 
"front of the bus Harry saw Hermione cover her eyes with her hands, "
Pigwidgeon still swaying 
happily on her shoulder. 
BANG. 
Chairs slid backward again as 
the Knight Bus jumped from the 
Birmingham motorway to a quiet co
untry lane full of hairpin bends. 
Hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of their way as 
they mounted the verges. From here 
they moved to a main street in 
"the middle of a busy town, then to "
"a viaduct surrounded by tall hills, "
then to a windswept road
" between high-rise flats, each time with a "
loud BANG. 
"“I’ve changed my mind,” muttered Ron, picking himself up from "
"the floor for the sixth time, “I neve"
r want to ride on here again.” 
"“Listen, it’s ’Ogwarts stop after th"
"is,” said Stan brightly, swaying to-"
ward them. “That bossy woman up fr
"ont ’oo got on with you, she’s "
given us a little tip to move you 
up the queue. We’re just gonna let 
"Madam Marsh off first, though —”"
 There was more retching from 
"downstairs, followed by a horrible sp"
attering sound. “She’s not feeling 
’er best. 
A few minutes later the Knight Bus screeched to a halt outside a 
"small pub, which squeezed itself ou"
t of the way to avoid a collision. 
They could hear Stan ushering the unfortunate Madam Marsh out of 
the bus and the relieved murmurings of her fellow passengers on the 
second deck. The bus moved on ag
"ain, gathering speed, until — "
BANG. 
They were rolling through a sn
owy Hogsmeade. Harry caught a 
"glimpse of the Hog’s Head down its side street, the severed boar’s head "
sign creaking in the wintry wind. Fl
ecks of snow hit the large window 
at the front of the bus. At last they
 rolled to a halt outside the gates to 
Hogwarts. 
Lupin and Tonks helped them off 
the bus with their luggage and 
then got off to say good-bye. Harry 
glanced up at the three decks of 
  527 "the Knight Bus and saw all the passengers staring down at them, noses "
flat against the windows. 
“You’ll be safe once you’re in th
"e grounds,” said Tonks, casting a "
"careful eye around at the deserted road. “Have a good term, okay?” "
"“Look after yourselves,” said Lu"
"pin, shaking hands all round and "
reaching Harry last. “And listen . . .” He lowered his voice while the 
rest of them exchanged last-minut
"e good-byes with Tonks, “Harry, I "
"know you don’t like Snape, but he is a superb Occlumens and we "
all — Sirius included — want you 
"to learn to protect yourself, so "
"work hard, all right?” "
"“Yeah, all right,” said"
" Harry heavily, looking up into Lupin’s pre-"
maturely lined face. “S
"ee you, then . . .” "
The six of them struggled up the slippery drive toward the castle 
dragging their trunks. Hermione wa
s already talking about knitting a 
few elf hats before bedtime. Harry glanced back when they reached 
the oak front doors; the Knight Bu
"s had already gone, and he half-"
"wished, given what was coming the fo"
"llowing day, that he was still on "
board. 
Harry spent most of the next day dr
eading the evening. His morning 
Potions lesson did nothing to dispel
" his trepidation, as Snape was as "
"unpleasant as ever, and Harry’s mood "
was further lowered by the fact 
that members of the D.A. were co
ntinually approaching him in the 
"corridors between classes, asking ho"
pefully whether there would be a 
meeting that night. 
“I’ll let you know when the next 
"one is,” Harry said over and over "
"again, “but I can’t do it tonight, I’"
ve got to go to — er — Remedial 
Potions. . . .” 
“You take 
Remedial Potions
"?” asked Zacharias Smith superciliously, "
having cornered Harry 
"in the entrance hall after lunch. “Good Lord, "
"you must be terrible, Snape doesn’t"
" usually give extra lessons, does "
he?” 
 528 "As Smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant fashion, Ron "
glared after him. 
“Shall I jinx him? I can still get him 
"from here,” he said, raising his "
wand and taking aim betwee
n Smith’s shoulder blades. 
"“Forget it,” said Harry dismally"
. “It’s what everyone’s going to 
"think, isn’t it? That I’m really stup —” "
"“Hi, Harry,” said a voice behind "
him. He turned around and found 
Cho standing there. 
"“Oh,” said Harry as his stomac"
h leapt uncomfortably. “Hi.” 
"“We’ll be in the library, Harry,"
"” said Hermione firmly, and she "
seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off toward the marble 
staircase. 
“Had a good Christmas?” asked Cho. 
"“Yeah, not bad,” said Harry. "
"“Mine was pretty quiet,” said Cho."
" For some reason, she was look-"
ing rather embarrassed. “Erm . . 
. there’s another Hogsmeade trip 
"next month, did you see the notice?” "
"“What? Oh no, I haven’t checke"
d the notice board since I got 
back. . . .” 
"“Yes, it’s on Valent"
ine’s Day. . . .” 
"“Right,” said Harry, wondering "
why she was telling him this. 
"“Well, I suppose you want to — ?” "
"“Only if you do,” she said eagerly. "
Harry stared. He had been about to
 say “I suppose you want to 
know when the next D.A. meeting is
?” but her response did not seem 
to fit. 
“I — er —” he said. 
"“Oh, it’s okay if you don’t,” sh"
"e said, looking mortified. “Don’t "
worry. I-I’ll see you around.” 
She walked away. Harry stood starin
"g after her, his brain working "
frantically. Then someth
ing clunked into place. 
  529 “Cho! Hey — CHO!” 
"He ran after her, catc"
hing her halfway up th
e marble staircase. 
“Er — d’you want to come into Hogsmeade with me on Valen-
tine’s Day?” 
"“Oooh, yes!” she said, blushing "
crimson and beaming at him. 
“Right . . . well . . . 
"that’s settled then,” said"
" Harry, and feeling that "
the day was not going to be a complete
" loss after all, he headed off to "
the library to pick up Ron and 
Hermione before their afternoon 
"lessons, walking in a rath"
er bouncy way himself. 
"By six o’clock that evening, howe"
"ver, even the glow of having suc-"
cessfully asked out Cho Chang was 
insufficient to lighten the omi-
nous feelings that intensified with every step Harry took toward 
Snape’s office. 
"He paused outside the door when he reached it, wishing he were al-"
"most anywhere else, then, taking a "
"deep breath, knocked, and entered. "
It was a shadowy room lined with 
shelves bearing hundreds of glass 
"jars in which floated slimy bits of animals and plants, suspended in "
variously colored potions. In a cor
ner stood the cupboard full of in-
gredients that Snape had once
 accused Harry — not without 
reason — of robbing. Harry’s atte
"ntion was drawn toward the desk, "
"however, where a shallow stone ba"
sin engraved with runes and sym-
bols lay in a pool of candlelight.
 Harry recognized it at once — Dum-
bledore’s Pensieve. Wondering what 
on earth it was 
"doing here, he "
jumped when Snape’s cold vo
ice came out of the corner. 
"“Shut the door behind you, Potter.” "
Harry did as he was told with th
e horrible feeling that he was im-
prisoning himself as he did so. When 
he turned back to face the room 
Snape had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair 
opposite his desk. Harry sat down an
"d so did Snape, his cold black "
"eyes fixed unblinkingly upon Harry, "
dislike etched in every line of his 
face. 
 530 "“Well, Potter, you know why you "
"are here,” he said. “The head-"
master has asked me to teach you 
Occlumency. I can only hope that 
you prove more adept at it than Potions.” 
"“Right,” said Harry tersely. "
"“This may not be an ordinary class,"
" Potter,” said Snape, his eyes "
"narrowed malevolently, “but I am still your teacher and you will there-"
fore call me ‘sir’ or ‘P
rofessor’ at all times.” 
“Yes . . . 
"sir,"
” said Harry. 
"“Now, Occlumency. As I told you "
back in your dear godfather’s 
"kitchen, this branch of magic seal"
s the mind against magical intrusion 
and influence.” 
"“And why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it, sir?” said "
"Harry, looking directly into Snape’"
"s dark, cold eyes and wondering "
whether he would answer. 
Snape looked back at him for a 
moment and then said contemptu-
"ously, “Surely even you could have "
"worked that out by now, Potter? "
The Dark Lord is highly 
skilled at Legilimency —” 
“What’s that? 
Sir
?” 
“It is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another per-
son’s mind —” 
"“He can read minds?” said Harry quickly, his worst fears confirmed. "
"“You have no subtlety, Potter,” said"
" Snape, his dark eyes glittering. "
“You do not understand fine distinctions. It is one of the shortcom-
ings that makes yo
u such a lamentable
 potion-maker.” 
"Snape paused for a moment, appar"
ently to savor the pleasure of 
"insulting Harry, before continuing"
", “Only Muggles talk of ‘mind "
"reading.’ The mind is not a book, to"
 be opened at will and examined 
at leisure. Thoughts are not etched
" on the inside of skulls, to be "
perused by any invader. The mind is a complex and many-layered 
"thing, Potter . . . or at least, most "
minds are. . . .” He smirked. “It is 
"true, however, that those who have "
"mastered Legilimency are able, un- "
  531 "der certain conditions, to delve into"
 the minds of their victims and to 
interpret their findings 
"correctly. The Dark Lord, for instance, almost "
always knows when somebody is lyin
g to him. Only those skilled at 
Occlumency are able to shut down 
those feelings and memories that 
"contradict the lie, and so utter "
falsehoods in his presence without 
detection.” 
"Whatever Snape said, Legilimency "
sounded like mi
nd reading to 
Harry and he did not like 
the sound of 
it at all. 
“So he could know what we’r
e thinking right now? Sir?” 
“The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and 
grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms 
to ensure the bodily and mental 
safety of those who dwell within 
"them,” said Snape. “Time and space "
"matter in magic, Potter. Eye con-"
tact is often essential to Legilimency.” 
"“Well then, why do I have "
to learn Occlumency?” 
"Snape eyed Harry, tracing his mouth "
"with one long, thin finger as "
he did so. 
“The usual rules do not seem to a
"pply with you, Potter. The curse "
that failed to kill you seems to ha
ve forged some kind of connection 
between you and the Dark Lord. The ev
"idence suggests that at times, "
when your mind is most relaxe
d and vulnerable — when you are 
"asleep, for instance — you are shar"
ing the Dark Lord’s thoughts and 
emotions. The headmaster thinks it 
inadvisable for this to continue. 
He wishes me to teach you how to
 close your mind to the Dark 
Lord.” 
Harry’s heart was pump
ing fast again. None of this added up. 
“But why does Professor Dumbledore 
want to stop it?” he asked 
"abruptly. “I don’t like it much, but "
"it’s been useful, hasn’t it? I mean "
. . . I saw that snake attack Mr. 
"Weasley and if I hadn’t, Professor "
Dumbledore wouldn’t
 have been able to sa
"ve him, would he? Sir?” "
"Snape stared at Harry for a few moments, still tracing his mouth  "
 532 "with his finger. When he spoke again, "
"it was slowly and deliberately, as "
though he weighed every word. 
“It appears that the Dark Lord 
has been unaware of the connection 
between you and himself until very recently. Up till now it seems that 
you have been experiencing his em
otions and sharing his thoughts 
"without his being any the wiser. However, the vision you had shortly "
before Christmas —” 
“The one with the snake and Mr. Weasley?” 
"“Do not interrupt me, Potter,” said "
Snape in a dangerous voice. “As 
I was saying . . . the vision you 
had shortly before Christmas repre-
sented such a powerful incursion up
on the Dark Lord’s thoughts —” 
"“I saw inside the snake’s head, not his!” "
“I thought I just told you no
"t to interrupt me, Potter?” "
But Harry did not care if Snape was an
gry; at last he seemed to be 
getting to the bottom of this busi
ness. He had moved forward in his 
"chair so that, without realizing it"
", he was perched on the very edge, "
tense as though poised for flight. 
“How come I saw through the snak
e’s eyes if it’s Voldemort’s 
thoughts I’m sharing?” 
“
Do not say the Dark Lord’s name
!” spat Snape. 
There was a nasty silence. They 
glared at each other across the 
Pensieve. 
“Professor Dumbledore says his 
"name,” said Harry quietly. "
"“Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,” Snape muttered. "
“While 
he
 may feel secure enough to use 
the name . . . the rest of 
"us . . .” He rubbed his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the "
spot where Harry knew the Dark 
Mark was burned into his skin. 
"“I just wanted to know,” Harry began again, forcing his voice back "
"to politeness, “why —” "
“You seem to have visited the sn
ake’s mind becaus
e that was where 
the Dark Lord was at that particul
"ar moment,” snarled Snape. “He  "
  533 was possessing the snake at the time
 and so you dreamed you were in-
side it too. . . .” 
“And Vol — he — realized I was there?” 
"“It seems so,” said Snape coolly. "
“How do you know?” said Harry urg
ently. “Is this just Professor 
Dumbledore guessi
"ng, or — ?” "
"“I told you,” said Snape, rigid in hi"
"s chair, his eyes sl"
"its, “to call me "
‘sir.’” 
"“Yes, sir,” said Harry impatientl"
"y, “but how do you know — ?” "
"“It is enough that we know,” said Snape repressively. “The impor-"
tant point is that the Dark Lord 
is now aware that you are gaining 
access to his thoughts
 and feelings. He has also deduced that the 
process is likely to work in reverse; 
"that is to say, he has realized that "
he might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return —” 
“And he might try and make me do things?” asked Harry. “
Sir
?” he 
added hurriedly. 
"“He might,” said Snape, sounding"
 cold and unconcerned. “Which 
brings us back to Occlumency.” 
Snape pulled out his wand from an
 inside pocket of his robes and 
"Harry tensed in his chair, but Snap"
e merely raised the wand to his 
temple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his hair. When he 
"withdrew it, some silvery substanc"
"e came away, stretching from tem-"
ple to wand like a thick gossamer st
"rand, which broke as he pulled the "
"wand away from it and fell gracefully into the Pensieve, where it "
"swirled silvery white, neither gas nor liquid. Twice more Snape "
raised the wand to his temple an
d deposited the si
lvery substance 
"into the stone basin, then, withou"
t offering any explanation of his 
"behavior, he picked up the Pensieve"
" carefully, removed it to a shelf "
out of their way and returned to face Harry with his wand held at 
the ready. 
“Stand up and take ou
"t your wand, Potter.” "
 534 Harry got to his feet feeling nervous
. They faced each other with 
the desk between them. 
“You may use your wand to attemp
"t to disarm me, or defend your-"
self in any other way you ca
"n think of,” said Snape. "
“And what are you going to do?” 
"Harry asked, eyeing Snape’s wand "
apprehensively. 
"“I am about to attempt to break into your mind,” said Snape softly. "
“We are going to see how well you re
sist. I have been told that you 
have already shown aptitude at resi
sting the Imperius Curse. . . . You 
will find that similar powers are need
"ed for this. . . . Brace yourself, "
now. . . . 
Legilimens
!” 
Snape had struck before Harry wa
"s ready, before Harry had even "
begun to summon any force of resistan
ce: the office swam in front of 
"his eyes and vanished, image after image was racing through his mind "
like a flickering film so vivid it blinded him to his surroundings. . . . 
"He was five, watching Dudley riding a new red bicycle, and his "
heart was bursting with jealousy. 
". . . He was nine, and Ripper the "
bulldog was chasing him up a tree and the Dursleys were laughing be-
"low on the lawn. . . . He was sitting under the Sorting Hat, and it was "
telling him he would do well in Sl
ytherin. . . . Hermione was lying in 
"the hospital wing, her face covered "
with thick black hair. . . . A hun-
dred dementors were closing in on 
him beside the dark
 lake. . . . Cho 
Chang was drawing nearer to him
 under the mistletoe. . . . 
"No,"
" said a voice in Harry’s head, as"
" the memory of Cho drew nearer, "
"you’re not watching that, you’re not watching it, it’s private"
 — 
He felt a sharp pain in his knee. Sn
ape’s office had 
come back into 
view and he realized that he had 
fallen to the floor; one of his knees 
had collided painfully with the leg 
of Snape’s desk. He looked up at 
"Snape, who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist. There "
was an angry weal
" there, like a scorch mark. "
“Did you mean to pr
oduce a Stinging Hex?” asked Snape coolly. 
"“No,” said Harry bitterly, "
getting up fr
om the floor. 
  535 "“I thought not,” said Snape contem"
ptuously. “You let me get in too 
far. You lost control.” 
“Did you see everything I saw?” 
"Harry asked, unsure whether he "
wanted to hear the answer. 
"“Flashes of it,” said Snape, his "
lip curling. “To whom did the dog 
belong?” 
"“My Aunt Marge,” Harry mu"
"ttered, hating Snape. "
"“Well, for a first atte"
mpt that was not as p
oor as it might have 
"been,” said Snape, raising his wand once more. “You managed to stop "
"me eventually, though you wasted"
 time and energy shouting. You 
must remain focused. Repel me with
 your brain and you will not need 
to resort to your wand.” 
"“I’m trying,” said Harry angrily, "
“but you’re not telling me how!” 
"“Manners, Potter,” said Snape dang"
"erously. “Now, I want you to "
close your eyes.” 
Harry threw him a filthy look before
 doing as he was told. He did 
not like the idea of stan
ding there with his eyes shut while Snape faced 
"him, carrying a wand. "
"“Clear your mind, Potter,” said Snape’s cold voice. “Let go of all "
emotion. . . .” 
But Harry’s anger at Snape contin
ued to pound through his veins 
like venom. Let go of his anger? He 
could as easily detach his legs. . . . 
"“You’re not doing it, Potter. . . . "
You will need more discipline than 
"this. . . . Focus, now. . . .” "
"Harry tried to empty his mind, tried not to think, or remember, or "
feel. . . . 
“Let’s go again . . . on the count of three . . . one — two — 
three — 
Legilimens
!” 
A great black dragon was rearing in
 front of him. . . . His father 
and mother were waving
 at him out of an enchanted mirror. . . . 
Cedric Diggory was lying on the gr
ound with blank eyes staring at 
him. . . . 
 536 “NOOOOOOO!” 
"He was on his knees again, his face buried in his hands, his brain "
aching as though someone had been trying to pull it from his skull. 
"“Get up!” said Snape sharply. “Get up! You are not trying, you are "
"making no effort, you are allowing "
"me access to memories you fear, "
handing me weapons!” 
"Harry stood up again, his"
 heart thumping wildly
 as though he had 
really just seen Cedric dead in the 
graveyard. Snape looked paler than 
"usual, and angrier, though not "
nearly as angry as Harry was. 
“I — am — making — 
"an — effort,” he said through clenched "
teeth. 
“I told you to empty yourself of emotion!” 
"“Yeah? Well, I’m finding that hard"
" at the moment,” Harry snarled. "
“Then you will find yourself easy
 prey for the Dark Lord!” said 
Snape savagely. “Fools who wear their 
"hearts proudly on their sleeves, "
"who cannot control their emotions, "
who wallow in sad memories and 
allow themselves to be provoked t
"his easily — weak people, in other "
words — they stand no chance agai
nst his powers! He will penetrate 
your mind with absu
"rd ease, Potter!” "
"“I am not weak,” said Harry in"
" a low voice, fury now pumping "
through him so that he thought he
 might attack Snape in a moment. 
"“Then prove it! Master yourself!” spat Snape. “Control your anger, "
"discipline your mind! We shall try again! Get ready, now! "
Legilimens
!” 
He was watching Uncle Vernon hamme
ring the letter 
box shut. . . . 
A hundred dementors were drifting 
across the lake in the grounds to-
ward him. . . . He was running al
ong a windowless passage with Mr. 
Weasley. . . . They were drawing ne
arer to the plain black door at the 
end of the corridor. . . . Harry expect
ed to go through it . . . but Mr. 
"Weasley led him off to the left, down"
 a flight of stone steps. . . . 
“I KNOW! I KNOW!” 
He was on all fours again on Snape’s 
"office floor, his scar was prick- "
  537 "ling unpleasantly, but the voice that"
 had just issued from his mouth 
was triumphant. He pushed himself up
 again to find Snape staring at 
"him, his wand raised. It looked as though, this time, Snape had lifted "
the spell before Harry had 
even tried to fight back. 
"“What happened then, Potter?” he asked, eyeing Harry intently. "
"“I saw — I remembered,” Harry pant"
ed. “I’ve just realized . . .” 
“Realized what?” asked Snape sharply. 
Harry did not answer at once; he 
was still savoring the moment of 
blinding realization as he
 rubbed his forehead. . . . 
He had been dreaming about a wi
ndowless corridor ending in a 
"locked door for months, without once re"
alizing that it was a real place. 
"Now, seeing the memory again, he "
knew that all along he had been 
dreaming about the corridor down
 which he had run with Mr. 
Weasley on the twelfth of August as they hurried to the courtrooms in 
the Ministry. It was the corridor le
ading to the Department of Mys-
"teries, and Mr. Weasley had been ther"
e the night that he had been at-
tacked by Voldemort’s snake. . . . 
He looked up at Snape. 
“What’s in the Depart
ment of Mysteries?” 
“What did you say?” Snape asked qu
"ietly and Harry saw, with deep "
"satisfaction, that "
Snape was unnerved. 
"“I said, what’s in the De"
"partment of Mysteries, "
sir
?” Harry said. 
"“And why,” said Snape slowly, "
“would you ask such a thing?” 
"“Because,” said Harry, "
"watching Snape closely for a reaction, “that "
corridor I’ve just seen — I’ve been
 dreaming about it for months — 
I’ve just recognized it — it leads 
to the Department 
of Mysteries . . . 
and I think Voldemort wa
nts something from —” 
“
I have told you not to 
say the Dark Lord’s name
!” 
They glared at each other. Harry’s 
"scar seared again, but he did not "
care. Snape looked agitated. When he spoke again he sounded as 
though he was trying to a
ppear cool and unconcerned. 
 538 “There are many things in the De
"partment of Mysteries, Potter, "
"few of which you would understand and none of which concern you, "
do I make myself plain?” 
"“Yes,” Harry said, still rubbing "
"his prickling scar, which was be-"
coming more painful. 
“I want you back here same time
" on Wednesday, and we will con-"
tinue work then.” 
"“Fine,” said Harry. He was desperat"
e to get out of Snape’s office 
and find Ron and Hermione. 
“You are to rid your mind of 
all emotion every night before 
"sleep — empty it, make it blan"
"k and calm, you understand?” "
"“Yes,” said Harry, who "
was barely listening. 
"“And be warned, Potter . . . I shall know if you have not prac-"
ticed . . .” 
"“Right,” Harry mumbled. He picked"
" up his schoolbag, swung it "
"over his shoulder, and hurried toward the office door. As he opened it "
"he glanced back at Snape, who ha"
d his back to Harry and was scoop-
ing his own thoughts out of the Pensieve with the tip of his wand and 
replacing them carefully inside his
 own head. Harry left without an-
"other word, closing the door carefully "
"behind him, his scar still throb-"
bing painfully. 
Harry found Ron and Hermione in 
"the library, where they were "
working on Umbridge’s most rece
nt ream of homework. Other stu-
"dents, nearly all of them fifth years, "
"sat at lamp-lit tables nearby, noses "
"close to books, quills scratching "
"feverishly, while the sky outside the "
mullioned windows grew steadily bl
acker. The only other sound was 
the slight squeaking of one of Ma
dam Pince’s shoes as the librarian 
"prowled the aisles menacingly, br"
eathing down the necks of those 
touching her precious books. 
Harry felt shivery; his scar was stil
"l aching, he felt almost feverish. "
When he sat down opposite Ron an
d Hermione he caught sight of  
  539 himself in the window opposite. 
"He was very white, and his scar "
seemed to be showing up 
more clearly than usual. 
“How did it go?” Hermione whis
"pered, and then, looking con-"
"cerned, “Are you al"
"l right, Harry?” "
"“Yeah . . . fine . . . I dunno,” sa"
"id Harry impatiently, wincing as "
pain shot through his scar again. “L
isten . . . I’ve just realized some-
thing. . . .” 
And he told them what he 
had just seen and deduced. 
"“So . . . so, are you saying . . .”"
" whispered Ron, as Madam Pince "
"swept past, squeaking slightly, “that the weapon — the thing You-"
Know-Who’s after — is in 
the Ministry of Magic?” 
"“In the Department of Mysteries, "
"it’s got to be,” Harry whispered. "
“I saw that door when your dad to
ok me down to the courtrooms for 
my hearing and it’s definitely the 
same one he was guarding when the 
snake bit him.” 
"Hermione let out a long, slow sigh. “Of course,” she breathed. "
“Of course what?” said 
Ron rather impatiently. 
"“Ron, think about it. . . . Sturgis Podmore was trying to get "
through a door at the Ministry of Ma
gic. . . . It must have been that 
"one, it’s too much of a coincidence!” "
“How come Sturgis was trying to break in when he’s on our side?” 
said Ron. 
"“Well, I don’t know,” Hermione admitted. “That "
is
 a bit odd. . . .” 
“So what’s in the Department 
of Mysteries?” Harry asked Ron. 
“Has your dad ever mentio
ned anything about it?” 
“I know they call the people wh
"o work in there ‘Unspeakables,’” "
"said Ron, frowning. “Because no o"
ne really seems to know what they 
do in there. . . . 
Weird place to have
 a weapon . . .” 
"“It’s not weird at all, it makes pe"
"rfect sense,” said Hermione. “It will "
be something top secret that the 
"Ministry has been developing, I ex-"
"pect. . . . Harry, are you "
sure you’re all right?” 
 540 For Harry had just run both his ha
nds hard over his forehead as 
though trying to iron it. 
"“Yeah . . . fine . . .” he said, lowering his hands, which were trem-"
bling. “I just feel a bi
t . . . I don’t like O
cclumency much. . . .” 
“I expect anyone would feel shaky if
 they’d had their mind attacked 
"over and over again,” said Hermione sympathetically. “Look, let’s get "
"back to the common room, we’ll be a "
bit more comfortable there. . . .” 
But the common room was packed an
d full of shrieks of laughter 
and excitement; Fred and George we
re demonstrating their latest bit 
of joke shop merchandise. 
"“Headless Hats!” shouted George, "
as Fred waved a pointed hat dec-
orated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students. “Two 
"Galleons each — watch Fred, now!” "
"Fred swept the hat onto his head, "
beaming. For a second he merely 
"looked rather stupid, then "
both hat and head vanished. 
"Several girls screamed, but everyone else was roaring with laughter. "
"“And off again!” shouted George, an"
d Fred’s hand groped for a mo-
ment in what seemed to be thin 
air over his shoulder; then his head 
reappeared as he swept the pink
-feathered hat from it again. 
"“How do those hats work, then?” "
"said Hermione, distracted from "
"her homework and watching Fred and George. “I mean, obviously it’s "
"some kind of Invisibility Spell, but "
it’s rather clever to have extended 
the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object. 
. . . I’d imagine the charm wouldn’t have a very long life though. . . .” 
Harry did not answer; he 
was still feeling ill. 
“I’m going to have to do this 
"tomorrow,” he muttered, pushing the "
books he had just taken out 
of his bag back inside it. 
"“Well, write it in your homewo"
rk planner then!” said Hermione 
encouragingly. “So 
you don’t forget!” 
Harry and Ron exchanged looks as he
" reached into his bag, with-"
drew the planner and op
ened it tentatively. 
  541 “
"Don’t leave it till later, you big second-rater"
!” chided the book as 
Harry scribbled down Umbridge’s homework. Hermione beamed at it. 
"“I think I’ll go to bed,” said Ha"
"rry, stuffing the homework planner "
back into his bag and making a mental
 note to drop it in the fire the 
first opportun
ity he got. 
He walked across the common ro
"om, dodging George, who tried "
"to put a Headless Hat on him, and reached the peace and cool of the "
stone staircase to the boys’ dormitori
"es. He was feeling sick again, just "
"as he had the night he had had the vision of the snake, but thought "
that if he could just
 lie down for a while he
 would be all right. 
He opened the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it 
when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must 
have sliced into the top of his he
"ad. He did not know where he was, "
whether he was standing or lying 
"down, he did not even know his own "
name. . . . 
Maniacal laughter was ringing in hi
s ears. . . . He was happier than 
he had been in a very long time. . . 
". Jubilant, ecstatic"
", triumphant . . . "
"A wonderful, wonderful thing had happened. . . . "
“Harry? HARRY!” 
Someone had hit him around the 
face. The insane laughter was 
punctuated with a cry of pain. The happiness was draining out of 
"him, but the laughter"
 continued. . . . 
He opened his eyes and as he did so
", he became aware that the wild "
laughter was coming out of his ow
n mouth. The moment he realized 
"this, it died away; Harry lay pantin"
"g on the floor, staring up at the "
"ceiling, the scar on his forehead "
throbbing horribly
. Ron was bending 
"over him, looking very worried. "
“What happened?” he said. 
"“I . . . dunno . . .” Harry gasped, "
sitting up again.
 “He’s really 
happy . . . really happy . . .” 
“You-Know-Who is?” 
 542 "“Something good’s happened,” mumble"
d Harry. He was shaking as 
badly as he had done after seeing 
the snake attack Mr. Weasley and felt 
very sick. “Something he’s
 been hoping for.” 
"The words came, just as they had "
back in the Gryffindor changing 
"room, as though a stranger wa"
s speaking them through Harry’s 
"mouth, yet he knew they were true"
". He took deep breaths, willing "
himself not to vomit all over Ron. He was very glad that Dean and 
Seamus were not here 
to watch this time. 
“Hermione told me to come and ch
"eck on you,” said Ron in a low "
"voice, helping Harry to his feet. “She "
says your defenses will be low at 
"the moment, after Snape’s been fiddl"
ing around with your mind. . . . 
"Still, I suppose it’ll help in"
" the long run, won’t it?” "
He looked doubtfully at Harry as 
he helped him toward bed. Harry 
nodded without any conviction and 
"slumped back on his pillows, "
aching all over from having fallen 
"to the floor so often that evening, "
his scar still prickling painfully. He 
could not help feeling that his first 
foray into Occlumency had weakened 
his mind’s resistance rather 
"than strengthening it, and he wonder"
"ed, with a feeling of great trepi-"
"dation, what had happened to make"
 Lord Voldemort the happiest he 
had been in fourteen years. 
Harry’s question was answered the very next morning. When 
Hermione’s 
Daily Prophet
" arrived she smoothed it out, gazed "
"for a moment at the front page, and then gave a yelp that caused every-"
one in the vicinity to stare at her. 
“What?” said Harry and Ron together. 
For an answer she spread the news
paper on the table in front of 
them and pointed at ten black-and-
white photographs that filled the 
"whole of the front page, nine showing wizards’ faces and the tenth, a "
witch’s. Some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering; 
others were tapping their fingers on
" the frame of their pictures, look-"
ing insolent. Each picture was capt
ioned with a name and the crime 
for which the person had 
been sent to Azkaban. 
"Antonin Dolohov,"
 read the legend beneat
"h a wizard with a long, "
"pale, twisted face who was sneering up at Harry, "
convicted of the bru-
tal murders of Gideon and Fabian Prewett.
"Augustus Rookwood,"
 said the caption beneath a pockmarked man 
with greasy hair who was leaning ag
"ainst the edge of his picture,  "
H 
 544 "looking bored, "
convicted of leaking Ministry of Magic Secrets to He-
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
But Harry’s eyes were drawn to the 
picture of the witch. Her face 
"had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page. She had long, "
dark hair that looked 
"unkempt and straggly in the picture, though he "
"had seen it sleek, thick,"
 and shining. She glar
ed up at him through 
"heavily lidded eyes, an arrogant, "
disdainful smile playing around her 
"thin mouth. Like Sirius, she retained vestiges of great good looks, but "
something — perhaps Azkaban — ha
d taken most of her beauty. 
"Bellatrix Lestrange, convicted of "
the torture and permanent incapaci-
tation of Frank and Alice Longbottom.
Hermione nudged Harry and pointed at the headline over the pic-
"tures, which Harry, co"
ncentrating on Bellatri
"x, had not yet read. "
MASS BREAKOUT FROM AZKABAN 
MINISTRY FEARS BLACK IS “RALLYING POINT” 
FOR OLD DEATH EATERS 
“Black?” said Harry loudly. “Not — ?” 
“
Shhh
!” whispered Hermione desperately. “Not so loud — just 
read it!” 
The Ministry of Magic announ
ced late last night that 
there has been a mass breakout from Azkaban. 
"Speaking to reporters in his private office, Cor-"
"nelius Fudge, Minister of "
"Magic, confirmed that ten "
high-security prisoners escaped in the early hours of 
"yesterday evening, and that he has already informed "
the Muggle Prime Minister 
of the dangerous nature 
of these individuals. 
"“We find ourselves, most unfortunately, in the "
same position we were tw
o and a half years ago when 
   545 the murderer Sirius Black 
"escaped,” said Fudge last "
night. “Nor do we think the two breakouts are unre-
lated. An escape of this magnitude suggests outside 
"help, and we must remember that Black, as the first "
person ever to break out of
" Azkaban, would be ideally "
placed to help others follow in his footsteps. We think 
it likely that these indivi
"duals, who include Black’s "
"cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, "
have rallied around Black 
"as their leader. We are, ho"
"wever, doing all we can to "
round up the criminals and beg the magical commu-
nity to remain alert and cautious. On no account 
should any of these individuals be approached.” 
"“There you are, Harry,” said Ron,"
 looking awestruck. “That’s why 
he was happy last
 night. . . .” 
"“I don’t believe this,” snarled Ha"
"rry, “Fudge is "
blaming the break-
out on 
Sirius
?” 
“What other options does he have
?” said Hermione bitterly. “He 
"can hardly say, ‘Sorry everyone, "
Dumbledore warned me this might 
"happen, the Azkaban guards have "
joined Lord Voldemort’ — stop 
"whimpering,"
 Ron — ‘and now Voldemort’s worst supporters have bro-
"ken out too.’ I mean, he’s spent a "
good six months telling everyone 
"you and Dumbledore are liars, hasn’t he?” "
Hermione ripped open the newspaper 
and began to read the report 
inside while Harry looked around 
the Great Hall. He could not un-
derstand why his fellow students were
 not looking scared or at least 
discussing the terrible piece of news
" on the front page, but very few of "
them took the newspaper every da
y like Hermione. There they all 
"were, talking about homework an"
d Quidditch and who knew what 
"other rubbish, and outside these "
walls ten more Death Eaters had 
swollen Voldemort’s ranks. . . . 
He glanced up at the staff tabl
e. It was a different story here: 
 546 "Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall were deep in conversation, "
both looking extremely grave.
 Professor Sprout had the 
Prophet 
propped against a bottle of ketchu
p and was reading the front page 
with such concentration that she wa
s not noticing the gentle drip of 
egg yolk falling into her lap from 
"her stationary spoon. Meanwhile, at "
"the far end of the table, Professor "
Umbridge was tucking into a bowl 
of porridge. For once her pouchy 
toad’s eyes were not sweeping the 
Great Hall looking for misbehaving students. She scowled as she 
gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent 
glance up the table to where Du
mbledore and McGonagall were talk-
ing so intently. 
“Oh my —” said Hermione wond
"eringly, still staring at the "
newspaper. 
“What now?” said Harry quickl
y; he was feeling jumpy. 
“It’s . . . 
"horrible,"
"” said Hermione, looking "
shaken. She folded back 
page ten of the newspaper and hand
ed it back to Harry and Ron. 
TRAGIC DEMISE OF 
MINISTRY OF MAGIC WORKER 
St. Mungo’s Hospital promised a full inquiry last 
night after Ministry of Magic worker Broderick 
"Bode, 49, was discovered dead in his bed, strangled by "
a potted-plant. Healers called
 to the scene were unable 
"to revive Mr. Bode, who had been injured in a "
workplace accident some w
eeks prior to his death. 
"Healer Miriam Strout, who was in charge of Mr. "
"Bode’s ward at the time of the incident, has been sus-"
pended on full pay and was unavailable for comment 
"yesterday, but a spokeswizard"
 for the hospital said in 
"a statement, “St. Mungo’s d"
eeply regrets the death of 
"Mr. Bode, whose health was "
improving steadily prior 
to this tragic accident. 
   547 “We have strict guidelines on the decorations per-
mitted on our wards but it 
"appears that Healer Strout, "
busy over the Christmas 
"period, overlooked the "
dangers of the plant on Mr. 
Bode’s bedside table. As 
"his speech and mobility improved, Healer Strout en-"
couraged Mr. Bode to look
" after the plant himself, "
unaware that it was not an 
"innocent Flitterbloom, but "
"a cutting of Devil’s Snare, which, when touched by "
"the convalescent Mr. Bode, "
throttled him instantly. 
“St. Mungo’s is as yet unable to account for the 
presence of the plant on the ward and asks any witch 
or wizard with information to come forward.” 
“Bode . . .” said Ron. 
“Bode.
 It rings a bell. . . .” 
"“We saw him,” Hermione whispered."
" “In St. Mungo’s, remember? "
He was in the bed opposite Lockhart’s
", just lying there, staring at the "
ceiling. And we saw the Devil’s 
Snare arrive. She — the Healer — 
said it was a Christmas present. . . .” 
Harry looked back at the story. A 
feeling of horror was rising like 
bile in his throat. 
“How come we didn’t recognize Devil’s Snare . . . ? We’ve seen it 
before . . . we could’ve stoppe
d this from happening . . .” 
“Who expects Devil’s Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a 
potted plant?” said Ron sharply. “It’s 
"not our fault, whoever sent it to "
the bloke is to blame! Th
ey must be a real prat
", why didn’t they check "
what they were buying?” 
"“Oh come on, Ron!” said Hermione "
"shakily, “I don’t think anyone "
could put Devil’s Snare in a pot and not realize it tries to kill whoever 
"touches it? This — this was murder. . . . A clever murder, as well. . . . "
"If the plant was sent anonymously, how’s anyone ever going to find "
out who did it?” 
Harry was not thinking about Devi
l’s Snare. He was remembering 
 548 taking the lift down to the ninth le
vel of the Ministry on the day of 
"his hearing, and the sallow-faced man who had got in on the Atrium "
level. 
"“I met Bode,” he said slowly. “I "
saw him at the Mi
nistry with your 
dad . . .” 
Ron’s mouth fell open. 
“I’ve heard Dad talk about him 
at home! He was an Unspeak-
able — he worked in the 
Department of Mysteries!” 
They looked at one another fo
"r a moment, then Hermione pulled "
"the newspaper back toward her, clos"
"ed it, glared for a moment at the "
"pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters on the front, then leapt to her "
feet. 
“Where are you going?” 
"said Ron, startled. "
"“To send a letter,” said Hermio"
"ne, swinging her bag onto her "
"shoulder. “It . . . well, "
I don’t know whether . . 
. but it’s worth trying 
. . . and I’m the only
 one who can . . .” 
“I 
hate
" it when she does that,” grumbled Ron as he and Harry got "
"up from the table and made their own, slower way out of the Great "
Hall. “Would it kill her to tell us 
what she’s up to fo
r once? It’d take 
her about ten more seco
"nds — hey, Hagrid!” "
Hagrid was standing beside the d
"oors into the entrance hall, wait-"
ing for a crowd of Ravenclaws to pa
ss. He was still as heavily bruised 
as he had been on the day he had co
me back from his mission to the 
giants and there was a new cut righ
t across the brid
ge of his nose. 
"“All righ’, you two?” he said, trying"
 to muster a smile but managing 
only a kind of pained grimace. 
"“Are you okay, Hagrid?” asked "
"Harry, following him as he lum-"
bered after the Ravenclaws. 
"“Fine, fine,” said Hagrid with a "
feeble assumption of airiness; he 
waved a hand and narrowly missed 
concussing a frightened-looking 
"Professor Vector, who was passing. “Jus’ busy, yeh know, usual stuff —  "
   549 lessons ter prepare — couple o’ sa
lamanders got scale rot — an’ I’m 
"on probation,” he mumbled. "
“
You’re on probation
?” said Ron very loudly
", so that many students "
passing looked around curiously. 
“Sorry — I mean — you’re on pro-
bation?” he whispered. 
"“Yeah,” said Hagrid. “’S’no more"
"’n I expected, ter tell yeh the "
truth. Yeh migh’ not’ve picked up on
" it, bu’ that inspection didn’ go "
"too well, yeh know . . . anyway,” he sighed deeply. “Bes’ go an rub a "
bit more chili powder on them sala
manders or their tails’ll be hangin’ 
"off ’em next. See yeh, "
Harry . . . Ron . . .” 
"He trudged away, out the front doors and down the stone steps into "
the damp grounds. Harry watche
"d him go, wondering how much "
more bad news he could stand. 
The fact that Hagrid was now on
 probation became common knowl-
edge within the school 
"over the next few days, "
but to Harry’s indigna-
"tion, hardly anybody appeared to "
"be upset about it; indeed, some "
"people, Draco Malfoy prominent "
"among them, seemed positively "
gleeful. As for the freakish death 
of an obscure Department of Mys-
"teries employee in St. Mungo’s, Harry, Ron, and Hermione seemed to "
be the only people who knew or ca
red. There was only one topic of 
"conversation in the corridors now: the ten escaped Death Eaters, "
whose story had finally filtered th
rough the school from those few 
people who read the newspapers. Rumo
rs were flying that some of the 
convicts had been spotted in Hogsme
"ade, that they were supposed to "
be hiding out in the 
Shrieking Shack and that they were going to 
"break into Hogwarts, just as Sirius Black had done. "
Those who came from Wizarding families had grown up hearing 
the names of these Death Eaters sp
oken with almost as much fear 
as Voldemort’s; 
the crimes they had comm
itted during the days 
of Voldemort’s reign of terror were le
gendary. There were
 relatives of  
 550 their victims among the Hogwarts
" students, who now found them-"
selves the unwilling objects of a gr
uesome sort of reflected fame as 
"they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, who had an uncle, aunt, and "
cousins who had all died 
at the hands of one of 
"the ten, said miserably "
during Herbology that she now had a 
good idea what it felt like to be 
Harry. 
"“And I don’t know how you stand it, it’s horrible,” she said bluntly, "
dumping far too much dragon manu
re on her tray of Screechsnap 
"seedlings, causing them to wri"
ggle and squeak in discomfort. 
It was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering 
and pointing in the corridors these 
"days, yet he thought he detected a "
slight difference in the tone of the whisperers’ voices. They sounded 
"curious rather than hostile now, and once or twice he was sure he over-"
heard snatches of conversation that
 suggested that the speakers were 
not satisfied with the 
Prophet’s
 version of how and why ten Death 
Eaters had managed to break out of
 Azkaban fortress. In their confu-
"sion and fear, these doubters now s"
eemed to be turning to the only 
other explanation available to th
"em, the one that Harry and Dumble-"
dore had been expounding 
since the previous year. 
It was not only the students’ m
ood that had changed. It was now 
quite common to come across two or 
"three teachers conversing in low, "
"urgent whispers in the corridors, br"
eaking off their conversations the 
moment they saw students approaching. 
“They obviously can’t talk freely 
"in the staffroom anymore,” said "
"Hermione in a low voice, as she,"
" Harry, and Ron passed Professors "
"McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout"
 huddled together outside the 
Charms classroom one day. “N
ot with Umbridge there.” 
“Reckon they know anything new?” 
"said Ron, gazing back over his "
shoulder at the three teachers. 
"“If they do, we’re not going to hear"
" about it, are we?” said Harry an-"
grily. “Not after Decree . . . 
What number are we on now?” 
   551 For new signs had appeared on the house notice boards the morn-
ing after news of th
e Azkaban breakout: 
—
  by order of
—
The High Inquisitor of Hogwarts 
Teachers are hereby banned from
 giving students any infor-
mation that is not strictly re
lated to the subjects they are 
paid to teach. 
The above is in accordance with 
Educational Decree Number Twenty-six. 
Signed: 
high inquisitor 
This latest decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes 
among the students. Lee Jordan had 
pointed out to Umbridge that by 
the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell Fred and George 
off for playing Exploding Snap 
in the back of the class. 
“Exploding Snap’s got nothing 
to do with Defense Against the 
"Dark Arts, Professor! That’s not info"
rmation relating to
 your subject!” 
"When Harry next saw Lee, the back of his hand was bleeding rather "
badly. Harry recommended essence of murtlap. 
Harry had thought that the breako
ut from Azkaban might have 
"humbled Umbridge a little, that she might have been abashed at the "
catastrophe that had oc
curred right under her be
loved Fudge’s nose. It 
"seemed, however, to have only intensified her furious desire to bring "
every aspect of life at Hogwarts under her personal control. She  
 552 seemed determined at the very least 
"to achieve a sacking before long, "
and the only question was whether it
 would be Professor Trelawney or 
Hagrid who went first. 
Every single Divination and Care
 of Magical Creatures lesson was 
now conducted in the presence of 
Umbridge and her clipboard. She 
lurked by the fire in the heavil
"y perfumed tower room, interrupting "
Professor Trelawney’s increasingly hy
sterical talks with difficult ques-
tions about Ornithomancy and Hept
"omology, insisting that she pre-"
dict students’ answers before they 
gave them and de
manding that she 
demonstrate her skill at the crystal 
"ball, the tea leaves, and the rune "
stones in turn. Harry thought that Professor Trelawney might soon 
crack under the strain; several time
s he passed her in the corridors (in 
itself a very unusual occurrence as sh
e generally remained in her tower 
"room), muttering wildly to herself,"
" wringing her hands, and shooting "
"terrified glances over her shoulder, "
all the time giving off a powerful 
"smell of cooking sherry. If he had not been so worried about Hagrid, "
he would have felt sorry for her — but if one of them was to be ousted 
"out of a job, there could be only"
 one choice for Harry as to who 
should remain. 
"Unfortunately, Harry co"
uld not see that Hagrid was putting up a 
better show than Trelawney. Though
 he seemed to be following Her-
mione’s advice and had 
shown them nothing mo
re frightening than 
"a crup, a creature indistinguishable "
from a Jack Russell terrier except 
"for its forked tail, since before Christ"
"mas, he also seemed to have lost "
his nerve. He was oddly distracted 
"and jumpy in lessons, losing the "
thread of what he was saying whil
"e talking to the class, answering "
questions wrongly and glancing anxi
ously at Umbridge all the time. 
"He was also more distant with Harry, Ron, and Hermione than he had "
"ever been before, expressly forbiddi"
ng them to visi
t him after dark. 
"“If she catches yeh, it’ll be all of"
" our necks on the line,” he told "
"them flatly, and with no desire to "
do anything that jeopardized his job 
"further, they abstained from walkin"
g down to his hut in the evenings. 
   553 It seemed to Harry that Umbridge
 was steadily depriving him of 
everything that made his life at Hogw
arts worth living: visits to Ha-
"grid’s house, letters from Sirius, hi"
"s Firebolt, and Quidditch. He took "
his revenge the only way he had: redoubling his efforts for the D.A. 
Harry was pleased to see that all 
"of them, even Zacharias Smith, "
had been spurred to work harder th
an ever by the news that ten more 
"Death Eaters were now on the loose, but in nobody was this improve-"
ment more pronounced than in Nevi
lle. The news of his parents’ at-
tacker’s escape had wrought a st
range and even slightly alarming 
"change in him. He had not once mentioned his meeting with Harry, "
"Ron, and Hermione on the closed "
"ward in St. Mungo’s, and taking "
"their lead from him, they had kept quiet about it too. Nor had he said "
anything on the subject of Bellatrix and her fellow torturers’ escape; in 
"fact, he barely spoke during D.A. "
"meetings anymore, but worked re-"
lentlessly on every new jinx and 
"countercurse Harry taught them, his "
plump face screwed up in concentrat
"ion, apparently indifferent to in-"
"juries or accidents, working harder"
 than anyone else in the room. He 
was improving so fast it was qu
ite unnerving and when Harry taught 
"them the Shield Charm, a means of "
deflecting minor jinxes so that 
"they rebounded upon the attacker, only Hermione mastered the "
charm faster than Neville. 
In fact Harry would have given a gr
eat deal to be making as much 
progress at Occlumency as Neville was making during D.A. meetings. 
"Harry’s sessions with Snape, whic"
"h had started badly enough, were "
"not improving; on the contrary, Ha"
rry felt he was ge
tting worse with 
every lesson. 
Before he had started studying Oc
"clumency, his scar had prickled "
"occasionally, usually during the nigh"
"t, or else following one of those "
strange flashes of Voldemort’s though
ts or moods that he experienced 
"every now and then. Nowadays, howeve"
"r, his scar hardly ever stopped "
"prickling, and he often felt lurches "
of annoyance or cheerfulness that 
were unrelated to what was happenin
"g to him at the time, which were "
 554 always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar. He 
had the horrible impression that he 
was slowly turning into a kind of 
aerial that was tuned in to tiny fl
"uctuations in Voldemort’s mood, and "
he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first 
"Occlumency lesson with Snape. What was more, he was now dream-"
ing about walking down the corridor
 toward the entrance to the 
Department of Mysteries almost eve
"ry night, dreams that always cul-"
minated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door. 
"“Maybe it’s a bit like an illness,"
"” said Hermione, looking concerned "
when Harry confided in her and Ron. “A fever or something. It has to 
get worse before it
 gets better.” 
"“It’s lessons with Snape that are making it worse,” said Harry flatly. "
"“I’m getting sick of my scar hurting, and I’m getting bored walking "
down that corridor every night.” He 
rubbed his forehead angrily. “I 
"just wish the door would open, I’m si"
ck of standing staring at it —” 
"“That’s not funny,” said Hermione"
 sharply. “Dumbledore doesn’t 
want you to have dreams about that
" corridor at all, or he wouldn’t "
have asked Snape to teach you Occlum
ency. You’re just going to have 
to work a bit harder
 in your lessons.” 
"“I am working!” said Harry, nettle"
"d. “You try it sometime, Snape "
"trying to get inside your head, it’s"
" not a bundle of laughs, you know!” "
“Maybe . . .” said Ron slowly. 
“Maybe what?” said Herm
ione rather snappishly. 
“Maybe it’s not Harry’s fault he can’
"t close his mind,” said Ron darkly. "
“What do you mean?” said Hermione. 
"“Well, maybe Snape isn’t really "
trying to help Harry. . . .” 
Harry and Hermione stared at him
. Ron looked darkly and mean-
ingfully from one to the other. 
"“Maybe,” he said again in a lower "
"voice, “he’s actually trying to "
open Harry’s mind a bit wider . . . 
make it easier for You-Know —” 
"“Shut up, Ron,” said Hermione angrily. “How many times have  "
   555 "you suspected Snape, and when have you "
ever
 been right? Dumble-
"dore trusts him, he works for the Or"
"der, that ought to be enough.” "
"“He used to be a Death Eater,” "
said Ron stubbornly. “And we’ve 
never seen proof that he 
really
 swapped sides. . . .” 
"“Dumbledore trusts him,” Hermione repeated. “And if we can’t "
"trust Dumbledore, we can’t trust anyone.” "
With so much to worry about an
d so much to do — startling 
amounts of homework that frequent
ly kept the fifth years working 
"until past midnight, secret D.A. m"
"eetings, and regular classes with "
Snape — January seemed to be passi
ng alarmingly fast. Before Harry 
"knew it, February had arrived, brin"
ging with it wetter and warmer 
weather and the prospect of the se
cond Hogsmeade visit of the year. 
Harry had had very little time to 
spare on conversations with Cho 
since they had agreed to visit the 
"village together, but suddenly found "
himself facing a Valentine’s Day 
spent entirely in her company. 
On the morning of the fourteenth 
he dressed particularly carefully. 
He and Ron arrived at breakfast just 
in time for the arrival of the post 
owls. Hedwig was not there — not 
that he had expected her — but 
Hermione was tugging a letter from 
the beak of an unfamiliar brown 
owl as they sat down. 
“And about time! If it hadn’t come 
"today . . .” she said eagerly, tear-"
ing open the envelope and pulling 
out a small piece of parchment. 
Her eyes sped from left to right as
 she read through the message and a 
grimly pleased expression 
spread across her face. 
"“Listen, Harry,” she said, looking up"
 at him. “This is really impor-
tant. . . . Do you think you could 
meet me in the Three Broomsticks 
around midday?” 
"“Well . . . I dunno,” said Harry du"
biously. “Cho might be expect-
ing me to spend the whole day with her. We never said what we were 
going to do.” 
 556 "“Well, bring her along if you must,” said Hermione urgently. “But "
will you come?” 
“Well . . . all ri
"ght, but why?” "
“I haven’t got time to
" tell you now, I’ve "
got to answer this 
quickly —” 
"And she hurried out of the Great Hall, the letter clutched in one "
hand and a piece of unea
ten toast in the other. 
“Are you coming?” Harry asked Ro
"n, but he shook his head, look-"
ing glum. 
“I can’t come into Hogsmeade at 
"all, Angelina wants a full day’s "
training. Like it’s going to help — we’re the worst team I’ve ever seen. 
"You should see Sloper and Kirke, th"
"ey’re pathetic, even worse than I "
am.” He heaved a great sigh. “I du
nno why Angelina won’t just let me 
resign. . . .” 
“It’s because you’re good when you’
"re on form, that’s why,” said "
Harry irritably. 
He found it very hard to be symp
athetic to Ron’s plight when he 
himself would have given almost an
ything to be playing in the forth-
coming match against Hufflepuff. Ro
"n seemed to notice Harry’s tone, "
because he did not mention Quiddi
"tch again during breakfast, and "
there was a slight fros
tiness in the way they 
said good-bye to each 
other shortly afterward. Ron depa
rted for the Qui
dditch pitch and 
"Harry, after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection "
"in the back of a teaspoon, proceed"
ed alone to the entrance hall to 
"meet Cho, feeling very apprehensiv"
e and wondering what on earth 
they were going to talk about. 
She was waiting for him 
a little to the side 
"of the oak front doors, "
looking very pretty with
 her hair tied back in
 a long ponytail. Harry’s 
feet seemed to be too big for his body
" as he walked toward her, and he "
was suddenly horribly aware of his ar
ms and how stupid they looked 
swinging at his sides. 
   557 "“Hi,” said Cho slightly breathlessly. "
"“Hi,” said Harry. "
They stared at each other for 
"a moment, then Harry said, “Well — "
"er — shall we go, then?” "
“Oh — yes . . .” 
They joined the queue of people 
"being signed out by Filch, occa-"
"sionally catching each other’s eye and grinning shiftily, but not talking "
to each other. Harry was relieved wh
"en they reached the fresh air, find-"
ing it easier to walk along in silence than just stand there looking awk-
"ward. It was a fresh, breezy sort of day and as they passed the Quidditch "
"stadium, Harry glimpsed Ron and Gi"
nny skimming over the stands 
and felt a horrible pang that he 
was not up there 
with them. . . . 
"“You really miss it, do"
n’t you?” said Cho. 
He looked around and saw her watching him. 
"“Yeah,” sighed Harry. “I do.” "
“Remember the first time we played 
"against each other, in the third "
year?” she asked him. 
"“Yeah,” said Harry, grinning. “You kept blocking me.” "
“And Wood told you no
t to be a gentleman 
and knock me off my 
"broom if you had to,” said Cho, smil"
ing reminiscently. “I heard he got 
taken on by Pride of Po
"rtree, is that right?” "
"“Nah, it was Puddlemere United, I "
saw him at the World Cup last 
year.” 
"“Oh, I saw you there too, remember? We were on the same camp-"
site. It was really 
"good, wasn’t it?” "
The subject of the Quidditch Worl
d Cup carried them all the way 
down the drive and out through the 
gates. Harry could hardly believe 
how easy it was to talk 
"to her, no more difficult"
", in fact, than talking "
"to Ron and Hermione, and he was just starting to feel confident and "
cheerful when a large gang of Slyt
"herin girls passed them, including "
Pansy Parkinson. 
 558 “Potter and Chang!” screeched Pansy to a chorus of snide giggles. 
"“Urgh, Chang, I don’t think much of your taste. . . . At least Diggory "
was good-looking!” 
"They sped up, talking and shriek"
ing in a pointed fashion with 
many exaggerated glances back at
" Harry and Cho, leaving an embar-"
rassed silence in their wake. Harry co
uld think of nothing else to say 
"about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly"
" flushed, was watching her feet. "
“So . . . where d’you want to go?” Harry asked as they entered 
Hogsmeade. The High Street was full of students ambling up and 
"down, peering into the shop window"
s and messing about together on 
the pavements. 
"“Oh . . . I don’t mind,” said Cho, "
shrugging. “Um . . . shall we just 
have a look in the 
shops or something?” 
They wandered toward Dervish 
and Banges. A large poster had 
been stuck up in the window and a 
few Hogsmeaders were looking at 
it. They moved aside when Harry 
and Cho approached and Harry 
found himself staring once more at
 the ten pictures of the escaped 
Death Eaters. The poster (“By Orde
r of the Ministry 
of Magic”) of-
fered a thousand-Galleon reward to
 any witch or wizard with infor-
mation relating to the recapture 
of any of the convicts pictured. 
"“It’s funny, isn’t it,” said Cho in a "
"low voice, also gazing up at the "
pictures of the Death Eaters. “Remember when that Sirius Black es-
"caped, and there were dementors "
all over Hogsmeade looking for 
him? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there aren’t de-
mentors anywhere. . . .” 
"“Yeah,” said Harry, tearing his eyes"
 away from Bellatrix Lestrange’s 
face to glance up and down the High 
"Street. “Yeah, it is weird. . . .” "
He was not sorry that there were 
"no dementors nearby, but now he "
"came to think of it, their absence wa"
s highly significant. They had not 
"only let the Death Eaters escape, they were not bothering to look for "
them. . . . It looked as though th
ey really were outside Ministry con-
trol now. 
   559 The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window 
"he and Cho passed. It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft’s; cold, "
heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry’s face and the back of his neck. 
“Um . . . d’you want to get a coff
"ee?” said Cho tentatively, as the "
rain began to fall more heavily. 
"“Yeah, all right,” said Harry,"
 looking around. “Where — ?” 
"“Oh, there’s a really nice place ju"
"st up here, haven’t you ever been "
to Madam Puddifoot’s?” she said br
"ightly, and she led him up a side "
road and into a small tea shop that
 Harry had never noticed before. It 
"was a cramped, steamy little place "
where everything seemed to have 
been decorated with frills or bows
. Harry was reminded unpleasantly 
of Umbridge’s office. 
"“Cute, isn’t it?” "
said Cho happily. 
"“Er . . . yeah,” said Harry untruthfully. "
"“Look, she’s decorated it"
 for Valentine’s Day!” 
"said Cho, indicating "
"a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small, "
"circular tables, occasionally throwing"
 pink confetti over the occupants. 
“Aaah . . .” 
They sat down at the last remainin
"g table, which was situated in "
"the steamy window. Roger Davies, "
"the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, "
was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl. They 
were holding hands. The sight ma
"de Harry feel uncomfortable, par-"
"ticularly when, looking around the tea "
"shop, he saw that "
it was full of 
"nothing but couples, all of them holding hands. Perhaps Cho would "
expect him to hold 
her
 hand. 
"“What can I get you, m’dears?” sa"
"id Madam Puddifoot, a very stout "
"woman with a shiny black bun, sq"
ueezing between their table and 
Roger Davies’s with great difficulty. 
"“Two coffees, please,” said Cho. "
In the time it took fo
r their coffees to arrive
", Roger Davies and his "
girlfriend started kissing over th
eir sugar bowl. Harry wished they 
wouldn’t; he felt that Davies was 
setting a standard with which Cho 
 560 would soon expect him to compete. He felt his face growing hot and 
"tried staring out of the window, but "
it was so steamed up he could not 
see the street outside. To postpone 
the moment when he had to look 
at Cho he stared up at the ceilin
g as though examining the paintwork 
and received a handful of confetti 
in the face from their hovering 
cherub. 
After a few more painful minutes Cho mentioned Umbridge; 
Harry seized on the subject with 
relief and they passed a few happy 
"moments abusing her, but the subjec"
t had already been so thoroughly 
canvassed during D.A. meetings it 
did not last very long. Silence fell 
again. Harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from 
the table next door and cast wildly 
around for something else to say. 
"“Er . . . listen, d’you want to come with me to the Three Broom-"
sticks at lunchtime? I’m meeting Hermione Granger there.” 
Cho raised her eyebrows. 
“You’re meeting Hermione Granger? Today?” 
"“Yeah. Well, she asked me to, so "
I thought I would. D’you want to 
come with me? She said it wo
uldn’t matter if you did.” 
“Oh . . . well . . . th
at was nice of her.” 
But Cho did not sound as though she 
thought it was nice at all; on 
"the contrary, her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather "
forbidding. 
"A few more minutes passed in total silence, Harry drinking his cof-"
fee so fast that he would soon n
"eed a fresh cup. Next door, Roger "
Davies and his girlfriend seemed
 glued together by the lips. 
Cho’s hand was lying on the tabl
"e beside her coffee, and Harry was "
feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it. 
"Just do it,"
 he told him-
"self, as a fount of mingled panic an"
d excitement surged up inside his 
chest. 
Just reach out and grab it.
 . . . Amazing how much more difficult 
it was to extend his arm twelve in
ches and touch her hand than to 
snatch a speeding Snit
ch from midair . . . 
"But just as he moved his hand forward, Cho took hers off the table. "
   561 She was now watching Roger Davies
 kissing his girlfriend with a 
mildly interested expression. 
"“He asked me out, you know,” she said in a quiet voice. “A couple "
of weeks ago. Roger. I tu
"rned him down, though.” "
"Harry, who had grabbed the sugar bo"
wl to excuse his sudden lung-
"ing movement across the table, co"
uld not think why she was telling 
him this. If she wished she were 
sitting at the table next door being 
"heartily kissed by Roger Davies, why had she agreed to come out with "
him? 
He said nothing. Their cherub 
threw another handful of confetti 
over them; some of it landed in the 
last cold dregs of coffee Harry had 
been about to drink. 
"“I came in here with Cedric last year,” said Cho. "
"In the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said, "
Harry’s insides had become glacial. 
He could not believe she wanted 
"to talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples surrounded them and "
a cherub floated over their heads. 
Cho’s voice was rather high
er when she spoke again. 
“I’ve been meaning to 
ask you for ages. . . . Did Cedric — did he 
m-m-mention me at all before he died?” 
This was the very last subject on 
"earth Harry wanted to discuss, and "
least of all with Cho. 
“Well — no —” he said quietly. “There — there wasn’t time for 
him to say anything. Erm . . . so . . . 
d’you . . . d’you get to see a lot of 
Quidditch in the holidays? You 
"support the Tornados, right?” "
His voice sounded falsely bright an
"d cheery. To his horror, he saw "
that her eyes were swimming with tear
"s again, just as they had been af-"
ter the last D.A. meeting before Christmas. 
"“Look,” he said desperat"
"ely, leaning in so that nobody else could "
"overhear, “let’s not talk about Cedr"
ic right now. . . . Let’s talk about 
something else. . . .” 
"But this, apparently, was quit"
e the wrong thing to say. 
 562 "“I thought,” she said, tears spattering down onto the table. “I "
thought 
you’d
 u-u-understand! I 
need
 to talk about it! Surely you 
n-need to talk about it t-too! I 
"mean, you saw it happen, d-didn’t "
you?” 
Everything was going nightmarishly wrong; Roger Davies’ girl-
friend had even unglued herself 
to look around at Cho crying. 
"“Well — I have talked about it,” "
"Harry said in a whisper, “to Ron "
"and Hermione, but —” "
"“Oh, you’ll talk to Hermione Gran"
"ger!” she said shrilly, her face "
"now shining with tears, and severa"
l more kissing couples broke apart 
to stare. “But you won’t talk to me
! P-perhaps it would be best if 
we just . . . just p-paid and you went and met up with Hermione 
"G-Granger, like you "
obviously want to!” 
"Harry stared at her, utterly bewilder"
"ed, as she seized a frilly napkin "
and dabbed at her shining face with it. 
"“Cho?” he said weakly, wishing Roger would seize his girlfriend "
and start kissing her again to st
op her goggling at him and Cho. 
"“Go on, leave!” she said, now crying"
 into the napkin. “I don’t know 
why you asked me out in the first 
place if you’re going to make 
arrangements to meet other girls right after me. . . . How many are 
you meeting after Hermione?” 
"“It’s not like that!” said Harry, and "
he was so relieved at finally un-
derstanding what she was annoyed ab
"out that he laughed, which he "
realized a split second too late was a mistake. 
"Cho sprang to her feet. The whole tearoom was quiet, and every-"
body was watching them now. 
"“I’ll see you around, Harry,” she sa"
"id dramatically, and hiccuping "
"slightly she dashed to the door, wrenc"
"hed it open, and hurried off into "
the pouring rain. 
"“Cho!” Harry called after her, bu"
t the door had already swung shut 
behind her with a tuneful tinkle. 
There was total silence within the tea shop. Every eye was upon 
   563 Harry. He threw a Galleon down onto 
"the table, shook "
pink confetti 
"out of his eyes, and follow"
ed Cho out of the door. 
"It was raining hard now, and she was nowhere to be seen. He sim-"
ply did not understand what had ha
ppened; half an hour ago they had 
been getting along fine. 
"“Women!” he muttered angrily, "
sloshing down the rain-washed 
street with his hands in his pockets.
 “What did she want to talk about 
Cedric for anyway? Why does she alwa
ys want to drag up a subject 
that makes her act like a human hosepipe?” 
"He turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within minutes "
he was turning into the doorway of
 the Three Broomsticks. He knew 
"he was too early to meet Hermione, but he thought it likely there "
would be someone in here with wh
om he could spend the intervening 
time. He shook his wet hair out of 
his eyes and looked around. Hagrid 
"was sitting alone in a corner, looking morose. "
"“Hi, Hagrid!” he said, when he "
had squeezed through the crammed 
tables and pulled up a chair beside him. 
Hagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he barely rec-
ognized him. Harry saw that he had tw
o fresh cuts on his face and sev-
eral new bruises. 
"“Oh, it’s you, Harry,” said"
 Hagrid. “You all righ’?” 
"“Yeah, I’m fine,” lied Harry; in fact, next to this battered and "
"mournful-looking Hagrid, he felt he "
did not have much to complain 
about. “Er — are you okay?” 
"“Me?” said Hagrid. “Oh yeah, I’m grand, Harry, grand. . . .” "
"He gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard, which was the size "
"of a large bucket, and sighed. Harry "
did not know what to say to him. 
They sat side by side in silenc
e for a moment. Then Hagrid said 
"abruptly, “In the same boat, "
"you an’ me, aren’ we, Harry?” "
“Er —” said Harry. 
“Yeah . . . I’ve said it before. . . . 
"Both outsiders, like,” said Hagrid, "
nodding wisely. “An’ both orphan
s. Yeah . . . 
both orphans.” 
 564 He took a great swig from his tankard. 
"“Makes a diff’rence, havin’ a dece"
"nt family,” he said. “Me dad was "
decent. An’ your mum an’ dad were de
cent. If they’d li
"ved, life woulda "
"bin diff’rent, eh?” "
"“Yeah . . . I s’pose,” said Harry caut"
iously. Hagrid seemed to be in 
a very strange mood. 
"“Family,” said Hagrid gloomily."
" “Whatever yeh say, blood’s im-"
portant. . . .” 
And he wiped a trickle of
 it out of his eye. 
"“Hagrid,” said Harry, unable to "
"stop himself, “where are you get-"
ting all these injuries?” 
"“Eh?” said Hagrid, looking startled. “Wha’ injuries?” "
"“All those!” said Harry, pointing at Hagrid’s face. "
“Oh . . . tha’s jus’ normal bumps 
"an’ bruises, Harry,” said Hagrid "
dismissively. “I got a rough job.” 
"He drained his tankard, set it back"
" upon the table, and got to his "
feet. 
"“I’ll be seein’ yeh, Harry. "
. . . Take care now. . . .” 
And he lumbered out of the pub looking wretched and then disap-
peared into the torrential rain. 
"Harry watched him go, feeling miser-"
"able. Hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something, but he "
seemed determined not 
to accept help. What was going on? But be-
fore Harry could think about the matt
"er any further, he heard a voice "
calling his name. 
"“Harry! Harry, over here!” "
Hermione was waving at him from 
the other side of
 the room. He 
got up and made his way toward her through the crowded pub. He 
was still a few tables away when he
 realized that Hermione was not 
alone; she was sitting at a table with
 the unlikeliest pair of drinking 
mates he could ever have imagin
ed: Luna Lovegood and none other 
"than Rita Skeeter, ex-journalist on the "
Daily Prophet
 and one of 
Hermione’s least favorite
 people in the world. 
   565 "“You’re early!” said Hermione, movi"
ng along to give him room to 
sit down. “I thought you were with
" Cho, I wasn’t expecting you for "
another hour at least!” 
"“Cho?” said Rita at once, twisting "
around in her seat to stare avidly 
at Harry. “A
 girl
?” 
She snatched up her crocodile-ski
n handbag and groped within it. 
“It’s none of 
your
" business if Harry’s been with a hundred girls,” "
Hermione told Rita co
olly. “So you can put th
at away right now.” 
Rita had been on the point of with
drawing an acid-green quill from 
her bag. Looking as though she ha
"d been forced to swallow Stinksap, "
she snapped her bag shut again. 
“What are you up to?” 
"Harry asked, sitting down and staring from "
Rita to Luna to Hermione. 
“Little Miss Perfect was just abou
"t to tell me when you arrived,” "
"said Rita, taking a large slurp of he"
r drink. “I suppose I’m allowed to 
talk
" to him, am I?” sh"
e shot at Hermione. 
"“Yes, I suppose you are,” "
said Hermione coldly. 
Unemployment did not suit Rita. 
The hair that had once been set 
in elaborate curls now hung lank 
and unkempt around her face. The 
scarlet paint on her two-inch talons was chipped and there were a cou-
ple of false jewels missing from he
r winged glasses. She took another 
great gulp of her drink and said 
"out of the corner of her mouth, "
"“Pretty girl, is she, Harry?” "
“One more word about Ha
rry’s love life and the deal’s off and that’s 
"a promise,” said Hermione irritably. "
"“What deal?” said Rita, wiping he"
r mouth on the ba
ck of her hand. 
“You haven’t mentioned a de
"al yet, Miss Prissy, you "
just told me to turn 
"up. Oh, one of these days . . .” Sh"
e took a deep shuddering breath. 
"“Yes, yes, one of these days you’ll"
 write more horrible stories about 
"Harry and me,” said Hermione indifferently. “Find someone who "
"cares, why don’t you?” "
“They’ve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year 
 566 "without my help,” said "
"Rita, shooting a sideways "
look at him over the 
"top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper, “How has that made "
"you feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstood?” "
"“He feels angry, of course,” said "
"Hermione in a hard, clear voice. "
“Because he’s told the Minister of Magic the truth and the Minister’s 
too much of an idiot to believe him.” 
"“So you actually stick to it, do you, that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-"
"Named is back?” said Rita, lowering"
 her glass and su
bjecting Harry to 
a piercing stare while her finger st
rayed longingly to 
the clasp of the 
crocodile bag. “You stand by a
ll this garbage Dumbledore’s been 
telling everybody about You-Know-W
ho returning and you being the 
sole witness — ?” 
"“I wasn’t the sole witness,” snar"
led Harry. “There were a dozen-odd 
Death Eaters there as well. Want their names?” 
"“I’d love them,” breathed Rita, no"
w fumbling in her bag once more 
and gazing at him as though he wa
s the most beautiful thing she had 
ever seen. “A great bold headline: ‘
Potter Accuses
 . . .’ A subheading: 
‘
Harry Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us.
"’ And then, beneath a "
nice big photograph of you: ‘
Disturbed teenage survivor of You-Know-
"Who’s attack, Harry Potter, 15, caused outrage yesterday by accusing re-"
spectable and prominent members of the Wizarding community of being 
Death Eaters.
 . . .’” 
The Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to 
her mouth when the rapturous expr
ession died out of her face. 
"“But of course,” she said, lowering"
 the quill and looking daggers at 
"Hermione, “Little Miss Perfect wouldn’t want that story out there, "
would she?” 
"“As a matter of fact,” said Hermione sweetly, “that’s exactly what "
Little Miss Perfect 
does
 want.” 
Rita stared at her. So did Harry.
" Luna, on the other hand, sang, "
“Weasley Is Our King” dreamily 
under her breath and stirred her 
drink with a cocktail
 onion on a stick. 
   567 “You 
want
 me to report what he says about He-Who-Must-Not-
Be-Named?” Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice. 
"“Yes, I do,” said Hermione. “The true"
 story. All the facts. Exactly as 
Harry reports them. He’ll give you al
"l the details, he’ll tell you the "
"names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he’ll tell you "
what Voldemort looks like now — oh
", get a grip on yourself,” she "
"added contemptuously, throwing a na"
"pkin across the table, for at the "
"sound of Voldemort’s name, Rita ha"
d jumped so badly that she had 
slopped half her glass of 
firewhisky down herself. 
Rita blotted the front of her gr
"ubby raincoat, still staring at "
"Hermione. Then she said baldly, “The "
Prophet 
wouldn’t print it. In 
"case you haven’t noticed, nobody "
believes his cock-and-bull story. 
"Everyone thinks he’s delusional. Now, if you let me write the story "
from that angle —” 
“We don’t need another story about 
how Harry’s lost his marbles!” 
said Hermione angrily. “We’ve had pl
"enty of those already, thank you! "
I want him given the opport
unity to tell the truth!” 
"“There’s no market for a story like that,” said Rita coldly. "
“You mean the 
Prophet
 won’t print it because Fudge won’t let 
"them,” said Hermione irritably. "
"Rita gave Hermione a long, ha"
"rd look. Then, leaning forward "
"across the table toward her, she said in a businesslike tone, “All right, "
Fudge is leaning on the 
"Prophet,"
 but it comes to the same thing. They 
won’t print a story that shows Harry 
in a good light. Nobody wants to 
read it. It’s against the public mo
od. This last Azkaban breakout has 
got people quite worried enough. Pe
ople just don’t want to believe 
You-Know-Who’s back.” 
“So the 
Daily Prophet
" exists to tell people what they want to hear, "
does it?” said Herm
ione scathingly. 
Rita sat up straight 
"again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her "
glass of firewhisky. 
“The 
Prophet
" exists to sell itself, you "
"silly girl,” she said coldly. "
 568 "“My dad thinks it’s an awful paper,” said Luna, chipping into the "
conversation unexpectedly. Sucking 
"on her cocktail onion, she gazed "
"at Rita with her enormous, protub"
"erant, slightly mad eyes. “He pub-"
lishes important stories that he th
inks the public needs to know. He 
doesn’t care about making money.” 
Rita looked dispar
agingly at Luna. 
“I’m guessing your father runs 
some stupid little village news-
letter?” she said. “‘Twenty-five Wa
ys to Mingle with Muggles’ and 
the dates of the next Bring-and-Fly Sale?” 
"“No,” said Luna, dipping her onion back into her gillywater, “he’s "
the editor of 
The Quibbler.
” 
Rita snorted so loudly that people
 at a nearby table looked around 
in alarm. 
“‘Important stories he thinks the 
public needs to kn
ow’?” she said 
witheringly. “I could manure my gard
en with the contents of that rag.” 
"“Well, this is your chance to raise "
"the tone of it a bit, isn’t it?” said "
Hermione pleasantly. “Luna says he
r father’s quite happy to take 
Harry’s interview. That’s wh
o’ll be publishing it.” 
Rita stared at them both for a moment and then let out a great 
whoop of laughter. 
“
The Quibbler
"!” she said, cackling. “You "
think people will take him 
seriously if he’s published in 
The Quibbler
?” 
"“Some people won’t,” said Hermio"
ne in a level voice. “But the 
Daily Prophet’s
 version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping 
holes in it. I think a lot of people 
will be wondering whether there isn’t 
a better explanation of what happened
", and if there’s an alternative "
"story available, even if it is publis"
hed in a” — she glanced sideways at 
"Luna, “in a — well, an "
unusual
 magazine — I think they might be 
rather keen to read it.” 
Rita did not say anything for a wh
"ile, but eyed Hermione shrewdly, "
her head a little to one side. 
   569 "“All right, let’s say for a moment I’"
"ll do it,” she said abruptly. “What "
kind of fee am I going to get?” 
“I don’t think Daddy exactly pays
 people to write for the maga-
"zine,” said Luna dreamily. “They do it"
" because it’s an honor, and, of "
"course, to see thei"
r names in print.” 
Rita Skeeter looked as though the 
taste of Stinksap was strong in 
her mouth again as she rounded on Hermione. “I’m supposed to do 
this 
for free
?” 
"“Well, yes,” said Hermio"
"ne calmly, taking a sip of her drink. “Other-"
"wise, as you very well "
"know, I will inform the "
authorities that you are 
"an unregistered Animagus. Of course, the "
Prophet
 might give you 
rather a lot for an insider’s acco
unt of life in Azkaban. . . .” 
Rita looked as though she would have liked nothing better than to 
seize the paper umbrella sticking 
out of Hermione’s drink and thrust 
it up her nose. 
“I don’t suppose I’ve got any choi
"ce, have I?” said Rita, her voice "
shaking slightly. She opened her croc
"odile bag once more, withdrew a "
"piece of parchment, and rais"
ed her Quick-Quotes Quill. 
"“Daddy will be pleased,” said Luna brightly. A muscle twitched in "
Rita’s jaw. 
"“Okay, Harry?” said Hermione, turn"
ing to him. “Ready to tell the 
public the truth?” 
"“I suppose,” said Harry, watc"
hing Rita balancing the Quick-
Quotes Quill at the ready on
 the parchment 
between them. 
"“Fire away, then, Rita,” said Hermione serenely, fishing a cherry "
out of the bottom
 of her glass. 
Luna said vaguely that she did not 
know how soon Rita’s interview 
with Harry would appear in 
"The Quibbler,"
 that her father was ex-
pecting a lovely long article on re
cent sightings of Crumple-Horned 
"Snorkacks. “And, of course, that’ll be a very important story, so "
Harry’s might have to 
"wait for the following issue,” said Luna. "
Harry had not found it an easy expe
rience to talk about the night 
when Voldemort had returned. Rita 
had pressed him for every little 
"detail, and he had given her eve"
"rything he could remember, knowing "
that this was his one big opportunit
y to tell the world the truth. He 
wondered how people would react to
 the story. He guessed that it 
would confirm a lot of people in th
e view that he was completely in-
"sane, not least because his story wo"
uld be appearing alongside utter 
rubbish about Crumple-Horned Snor
kacks. But the breakout of Bel-
latrix Lestrange and her fellow De
ath Eaters had given Harry a burn-
"ing desire to do something, whet"
her it worked or not. . . . 
“Can’t wait to see what Umbridge 
"thinks of you going public,” said "
"Dean, sounding awestruck at dinner on Monday night. Seamus was  "
L
   571 shoveling down large amounts of 
chicken-and-ham pie on Dean’s 
"other side, but Harry kn"
ew he was listening. 
"“It’s the right thing to do, Harry,” "
"said Neville, who was sitting op-"
"posite him. He was rather pale, but went on in a low voice, “It must "
have been . . . toug
h . . . talking about 
it. . . . Was it?” 
"“Yeah,” mumbled Harry, “but people have got to know what "
Voldemort’s capable 
"of, haven’t they?” "
"“That’s right,” said Neville, nodding"
", “and his Death Eaters too . . . "
People should know. . . .” 
Neville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato. 
"Seamus looked up, but when he caug"
ht Harry’s eye he looked quickly 
back at his plate again. After a 
"while Dean, Seamus, and Neville de-"
"parted for the common room, leaving Harry and Hermione at the "
"table waiting for Ron, who had no"
t yet had dinner because of Quid-
ditch practice. 
Cho Chang walked into the hall 
with her friend Marietta. Harry’s 
"stomach gave an unpleasant lurch, "
but she did not look over at the 
Gryffindor table and sat dow
n with her back to him. 
"“Oh, I forgot to ask you,” said He"
"rmione brightly, glancing over at "
"the Ravenclaw table, “what happened on your date with Cho? How "
come you were back so early?” 
"“Er . . . well, it was . . .” said"
" Harry, pulling a dish of rhubarb "
crumble toward him and helping himse
"lf to seconds, “a complete fi-"
"asco, now you mention it.” "
And he told her what had happened in Madam Puddifoot’s Tea 
Shop. 
"“. . . so then,” he finished several "
"minutes later, as the final bit of "
"crumble disappeared, “she jumps up"
", right, and says ‘I’ll see you "
"around, Harry,’ and runs out of th"
e place!” He put down his spoon 
"and looked at Hermione. “I mean, wh"
at was all that about? What was 
going on?” 
 572 Hermione glanced over at the back
 of Cho’s head 
"and sighed. “Oh, "
"Harry,” she said sadly. “Well, I’m so"
"rry, but you were a bit tactless.” "
“
"Me,"
" tactless?” said Harry, outraged"
. “One minute we were getting 
"on fine, next minute she was tellin"
g me that Roger Davies asked her 
"out, and how she used to go and snog Cedric in that stupid tea "
shop — how was I supposed
 to feel about that?” 
"“Well, you see,” said Hermione, with the patient air of one ex-"
plaining that one plus one equals
" two to an overemotional toddler, "
“you shouldn’t have told her that
 you wanted to meet me halfway 
through your date.” 
"“But, but,” spluttered Harry, “but "
— you told me to meet you at 
"twelve and to bring her along, ho"
w was I supposed to do that without 
telling her — ?” 
“You should have told her differ
"ently” said Hermione, still with "
that maddeningly patient air. “You sh
ould have said it was really an-
"noying, but I’d "
made
 you promise to come al
ong to the Three Broom-
"sticks, and you really didn’t want to go, you’d much rather spend the "
"whole day with her, but unfortunately you thought you really ought "
"to meet me and would she please, please come along with you, and "
hopefully you’d be able to get away
 more quickly? And it might have 
been a good idea to mention how 
"ugly you think I am too,” Hermi-"
one added as an afterthought. 
“But I don’t think you’re ug
"ly,” said Harry, bemused. "
Hermione laughed. 
"“Harry, you’re worse than Ron. . . . Well, no, you’re not,” she "
"sighed, as Ron himself came stumping into the Hall splattered with "
mud and looking grumpy. “Look 
— you upset Cho when you said 
"you were going to meet me, so she tried to make you jealous. It was "
her way of trying to find 
out how much yo
u liked her.” 
“Is that what she was doing?” sa
id Harry as Ron dropped onto the 
bench opposite them and 
pulled every dish with
in reach toward him- 
   573 "self. “Well, wouldn’t it "
have been easier if she’
d just asked me whether 
I liked her better than you?” 
“Girls don’t often as
"k questions like that,” said Hermione. "
"“Well, they should!” said Harry fo"
rcefully. “Then I could’ve just 
"told her I fancy her, and she woul"
dn’t have had to get herself all 
worked up again ab
out Cedric dying!” 
“I’m not saying what she did wa
"s sensible,” said Hermione, as "
"Ginny joined them, just as muddy"
 as Ron and looking equally dis-
gruntled. “I’m just trying to make
 you see how she was feeling at the 
time.” 
"“You should write a book,” Ron "
told Hermione as he cut up his 
"potatoes, “translating mad things "
girls do so boys can understand 
them.” 
"“Yeah,” said Harry fervently, lookin"
g over at the Ravenclaw table. 
Cho had just got up; stil
"l not looking at him, sh"
e left the Great Hall. 
"Feeling rather depressed, he looked"
" back at Ron and Ginny. “So, how "
was Quidditch practice?” 
"“It was a nightmare,” said Ron in a surly voice. "
"“Oh come on,” said Hermione, l"
"ooking at Ginny, “I’m sure it "
wasn’t that —” 
"“Yes, it was,” said Ginny. “It was appalling. Angelina was nearly in "
tears by the end of it.” 
Ron and Ginny went off for ba
ths after dinner; Harry and Her-
mione returned to the busy Gryffi
ndor common room and their usual 
pile of homework. Harry had been st
ruggling with a new star chart for 
Astronomy for half an hour when Fred and George turned up. 
“Ron and Ginny not here?” aske
"d Fred, looking around as he "
"pulled up a chair and, when Harry "
"shook his head, he said, “Good. "
We were watching their practice. They’re going to be slaughtered. 
They’re complete rubbish without us.” 
"“Come on, Ginny’s not bad,” said George fairly, sitting down next  "
 574 "to Fred. “Actually, I dunno how she "
"got so good, seeing how we never "
let her play with us. . . .” 
“She’s been breaking into your br
oom shed in the garden since the 
age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you 
"weren’t looking,” said Hermione from "
behind her tottering pile of An-
cient Rune books. 
"“Oh,” said George, looking mildly"
 impressed. “Well — that’d ex-
plain it.” 
“Has Ron saved a goal yet?” aske
"d Hermione, peering over the top "
of 
Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms. 
"“Well, he can do it if he doesn’t think anyone’s watching him,” said "
"Fred, rolling his eyes. “So all we ha"
ve to do is ask the crowd to turn 
their backs and talk amon
g themselves every time
 the Quaffle goes up 
his end on Saturday.” 
"He got up again and moved restlessly to the window, staring out "
across the dark grounds. 
"“You know, Quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth "
staying for.” 
Hermione cast him a stern look. 
“You’ve got exams coming!” 
"“Told you already, we’re not fussed about N.E.W.T.s,” said Fred. "
"“The Snackboxes are ready to roll, we found out how to get rid of "
"those boils, just a couple of drop"
"s of murtlap essence sorts them, Lee "
put us onto it. . . .” 
George yawned widely and looked 
out disconsolately at the cloudy 
night sky. 
“I dunno if I even want to watch this match. If Zacharias Smith 
beats us I might have to kill myself.” 
"“Kill him, more like,” said Fred firmly. "
"“That’s the trouble with Quidditch,” said Hermione absentmind-"
"edly, once again bent over her Rune "
"translation, “it creates all this bad "
feeling and tension between the Houses.” 
   575 She looked up to find her copy of 
Spellman’s Syllabary
 and caught 
"Fred, George, and Harry looking at "
her with expressions of mingled 
disgust and incredulit
y on their faces. 
"“Well, it does!” she said impatien"
"tly. “It’s only a game, isn’t it?” "
"“Hermione,” said Harry,"
" shaking his head, “you’re good on feelings "
"and stuff, but you just don’t understand about Quidditch.” "
"“Maybe not,” she said da"
"rkly, returning to"
" her translation again, “but "
at least my happiness 
doesn’t depend on Ron’
s goalkeeping ability.” 
And though Harry would rather ha
ve jumped off the Astronomy 
"Tower than admit it to her, by the time he had watched the game the "
following Saturday he would have 
given any number of Galleons not 
to care about Quidditch either. 
The very best thing you could say 
about the match wa
s that it was 
short; the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty-two min-
utes of agony. It was hard to sa
y what the worst thing was: Harry 
thought it was a close-run contest be
"tween Ron’s fourteenth failed save, "
Sloper missing the Bludger but hittin
g Angelina in the mouth with his 
"bat, and Kirke shrieking and fallin"
g backward off his broom as Zacha-
rias Smith zoomed at him carrying 
the Quaffle. The miracle was that 
Gryffindor only lost by ten points: 
Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch 
"from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby’s nose, so that the final "
score was two hundred 
and forty versus two 
hundred and thirty. 
"“Good catch,” Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where "
the atmosphere closely re
sembled that of a partic
ularly dismal funeral. 
"“I was lucky,” she shrugged. “It wa"
sn’t a very fast Snitch and Sum-
"merby’s got a cold, he sneezed and cl"
osed his eyes at exactly the wrong 
"moment. Anyway, once you’re"
 back on the team —” 
"“Ginny, I’ve got a lifelong ban.” "
“You’re banned as long
" as Umbridge is in the school,” Ginny cor-"
rected him. “There’s a difference. 
"Anyway, once you’re back, I think "
I’ll try out for Chaser. Angelina and 
Alicia are both leaving next year 
and I prefer goal-scoring to Seeking anyway.” 
 576 Harry looked over at 
"Ron, who was hunched in"
" a corner, staring at "
"his knees, a bottle of butterbeer clutched in his hand. "
"“Angelina still won’t let him resign,” Ginny said, as though reading "
Harry’s mind. “She 
says she knows he’s got it in him.” 
"Harry liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in Ron, but at "
the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the 
team. Ron had left the pitch to an
other booming chorus of “Weasley 
"Is Our King” sung with great gusto by the Slytherins, who were now "
favorites to win the Quidditch Cup. 
Fred and George wandered over. 
“I haven’t got the heart to take th
"e mickey out of him, even,” said "
"Fred, looking over at Ron’s crumpled"
 figure. “Mind you . . . when he 
missed the four
teenth . . .” 
He made wild motions with his ar
ms as though doing an upright 
doggy-paddle. 
"“Well, I’ll save it"
" for parties, eh?” "
Ron dragged himself up to bed shor
tly after this. Out of respect for 
"his feelings, Harry waited a while b"
efore going up to the dormitory 
"himself, so that Ron could pretend to"
 be asleep if he wanted to. Sure 
"enough, when Harry finally entered th"
e room Ron was sn
oring a little 
too loudly to be en
tirely plausible. 
"Harry got into bed, thinking ab"
out the match. It had been im-
mensely frustrating watching from the sidelines. He was quite im-
pressed by Ginny’s performance but he
 felt that if he had been playing 
he could have caught the Snitch 
sooner. . . . There had been a mo-
ment when it had been fluttering near
 Kirke’s ankle; if she hadn’t hes-
"itated, she might have been able to"
 scrape a win for Gryffindor. . . . 
Umbridge had been sitting a few 
rows below Harry and Hermione. 
Once or twice she had turned squatly 
"in her seat to look at him, her "
wide toad’s mouth stretched in what
 he thought had been a gloating 
smile. The memory of it made him fee
l hot with anger as he lay there  
   577 "in the dark. After a few minutes, however, he remembered that he was "
supposed to be emptying his mind of
 all emotion before
" he slept, as "
Snape kept instructing him at the 
end of every Occlumency lesson. 
"He tried for a moment or two, but the thought of Snape on top of "
memories of Umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling re-
"sentment, and he found himself fo"
cusing instead on how much he 
"loathed the pair of them. Slowly, Ron’s snores died away, replaced by "
"the sound of deep, slow breathing. It took Harry much longer to get "
"to sleep; his body was tired, but it "
took his brain a long time to close 
down. 
He dreamed that Neville and Pr
ofessor Sprout were waltzing 
around the Room of Requiremen
t while Professor McGonagall 
played the bagpipes. He watched th
"em happily for a while, then de-"
cided to go and find the other members of the D.A. . . . 
But when he left the room he fo
und himself facing
", not the tapes-"
"try of Barnabas the Barmy, but a "
torch burning in its bracket on a 
stone wall. He turned his head slowly
" to the left. There, at the far end "
of the windowless passage
", was a plain, black door. "
He walked toward it with a sens
e of mounting excitement. He had 
the strangest feeling that
 this time he was goin
"g to get lucky at last, "
and find the way to open it. . . . He
 was feet from it and saw with a 
leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light 
down the right-hand side
. . . . The door was ajar
. . . . He stretched 
out his hand to pu
sh it wide and — 
"Ron gave a loud, rasping, genui"
"ne snore, and Harry awoke abruptly "
with his right hand stretched in fron
"t of him in the darkness, to open "
a door that was hundreds of miles aw
ay. He let it fall 
with a feeling of 
mingled disappointment and guilt. He knew he should not have seen 
"the door, but at the same time, felt "
so consumed with curiosity about 
what was behind it that he could no
t help feeling annoyed with Ron. 
. . . If he could have saved his sn
ore for just anot
her minute . . . 
 578 ' '
They entered the Great Hall for brea
kfast at exactly the same moment 
as the post owls on Monday morning. Hermione was not the only 
person eagerly awaiting her 
Daily Prophet: 
Nearly everyone was eager 
for more news about the escaped Deat
"h Eaters, who, despite many re-"
"ported sightings, had still not been"
 caught. She gave the delivery owl 
a Knut and unfolded the newspaper
 eagerly while Harry helped him-
self to orange juice; as he had only
 received one note during the entire 
"year he was sure, when the first ow"
l landed with a thud in front of 
"him, that it had made a mistake. "
"“Who’re you after?” he asked it, "
languidly removing his orange 
juice from underneath its beak and leaning forward to see the recipi-
ent’s name and address: 
Harry Potter 
Great Hall 
Hogwarts School 
"Frowning, he made to take the le"
"tter from the owl, but before he "
"could do so, three, four, five more "
owls had fluttered down beside it 
"and were jockeying for position, trea"
"ding in the butter, knocking over "
"the salt, and each atte"
mpting to give him 
their letters first. 
"“What’s going on?” Ron asked in amazement, as the whole of "
Gryffindor table leaned forward to watch as another seven owls 
"landed amongst the first ones, screec"
"hing, hooting, and flapping their "
wings. 
"“Harry!” said Hermione breathlessly, plunging her hands into the "
feathery mass and pulling out a screec
"h owl bearing a long, cylindrical "
package. “I think I know what th
is means — open this one first!” 
Harry ripped off the brow
n packaging. Out rolled a tightly furled 
copy of March’s edition of 
The Quibbler.
 He unrolled it to see his own 
   579 face grinning sheepishly at him from the front cover. In large red let-
ters across his picture were the words: 
HARRY POTTER SPEAKS OUT AT LAST: 
THE TRUTH ABOUT HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED 
AND THE NIGHT I SAW HIM RETURN 
"“It’s good, isn’t it?” said Luna"
", who had drifted over to the "
Gryffindor table and now squeezed
 herself onto the bench between 
"Fred and Ron. “It came out yesterday, I asked Dad to send you a free "
"copy. I expect all these,” she waved "
a hand at the assembled owls still 
scrabbling around on th
"e table in front of Harry, “are letters from "
readers.” 
"“That’s what I thought,” said He"
"rmione eagerly, “Harry, d’you "
mind if we — ?” 
"“Help yourself,” said Harry,"
 feeling slightly bemused. 
Ron and Hermione both starte
d ripping open envelopes. 
“This one’s from a bloke who thinks
" you’re off your rocker,” said "
"Ron, glancing down his le"
tter. “Ah well . . .” 
“This woman recommends you try a g
ood course of Shock Spells at 
"St. Mungo’s,” said Hermione, look"
ing disappointed and crumpling 
up a second. 
"“This one looks okay, though,” said Harry slowly, scanning a long "
letter from a witch in Paisley. “H
"ey, she says she believes me!” "
"“This one’s in two minds,” said Fr"
"ed, who had joined"
 in the letter-
opening with enthusiasm. “Says you don’t come across as a mad per-
"son, but he really doesn’t want to believe You-Know-Who’s back so he "
doesn’t know what to think now. . 
". . Blimey, what a waste of parch-"
ment . . .” 
“Here’s another one you’ve conv
"inced, Harry!” said Hermione ex-"
citedly. “‘Having read your side of the story I am forced to the con-
clusion that the 
Daily Prophet
 has treated you very u
nfairly. . . . Little 
 580 though I want to think that He
-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has re-
"turned, I am forced to accept that you are telling the truth. . . .’ Oh "
this is wonderful!” 
“Another one who thinks you’re 
"barking,” said Ron, throwing a "
"crumpled letter over his shoulder, “but this one says you’ve got her "
"converted, and she now thinks you’re a real hero — she’s put in a pho-"
tograph too — wow —” 
“What is going on here?” said 
"a falsely sweet, girlish voice. "
Harry looked up with his hands fu
ll of envelopes. Professor Um-
bridge was standing behind Fred an
"d Luna, her bulging toad’s eyes "
scanning the mess of owls and letter
s on the table in front of Harry. 
Behind her he saw many of the students watching them avidly. 
“Why have you got all 
"these letters, Mr. Potter"
?” she asked slowly. 
“Is that a crime now?” said Fr
ed loudly. “Getting mail?” 
"“Be careful, Mr. Weasley, or I shall have to put you in detention,” "
"said Umbridge. “Well, Mr. Potter?” "
"Harry hesitated, but he did not see "
how he could keep what he had 
done quiet; it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of 
The 
Quibbler
 came to Umbridge’s attention. 
“People have written to me beca
"use I gave an interview,” said "
Harry. “About what happened to me last June.” 
For some reason he glanced up at th
e staff table as he
 said this. He 
had the strangest feeling that Du
mbledore had been watching him a 
"second before, but when he looked, Dumbledore seemed to be ab-"
sorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick. 
“An interview?” repeated Umbrid
"ge, her voice thinner and higher "
than ever. “What do you mean?” 
"“I mean a reporter asked me questions and I answered them,” said "
Harry. “Here —” 
And he threw the copy of 
The Quibbler
 at her. She caught it and 
"stared down at the cover. Her pale, "
"doughy face turned an ugly, patchy "
violet. 
   581 "“When did you do this?” she asked, her voice trembling slightly. "
"“Last Hogsmeade weekend,” said Harry. "
"She looked up at him, incandesce"
"nt with rage, the magazine shak-"
ing in her stubby fingers. 
“There will be no more Hogsmead
"e trips for you, Mr. Potter,” she "
whispered. “How you dare . . . how 
you could . . .” She took a deep 
breath. “I have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies. The 
"message, apparently, has still not su"
nk in. Fifty points from Gryffin-
dor and another week’s 
worth of detentions.” 
"She stalked away, clutching "
The Quibbler
" to her chest, the eyes of "
many students following her. 
By mid-morning enormous signs had been put up all over the 
"school, not just on House notice boards, but in the corridors and class-"
rooms too. 
—
  by order of
—
The High Inquisitor of Hogwarts 
Any student found in poss
ession of the magazine 
The Quib-
bler 
will be expelled. 
The above is in accordance with 
Educational Decree Number Twenty-seven.
Signed: 
high inquisitor
"For some reason, every time Hermio"
ne caught sight of one of these 
signs she beamed with pleasure. 
“What exactly are you so happy about?” Harry asked her. 
 582 "“Oh Harry, don’t you see?” Hermio"
ne breathed. “If she could have 
done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this 
school will read your inte
"rview, it was banning it!” "
And it seemed that Hermione was qu
ite right. By the end of that 
"day, though Harry had not seen"
 so much as a corner of 
The Quibbler
"anywhere in the school, the whole pl"
ace seemed to be quoting the in-
terview at each other; Harry heard th
em whispering about it as they 
"queued up outside classes, discussing it over lunch and in the back of "
"lessons, while Hermione even reported that every occupant of the cu-"
bicles in the girls’ to
ilets had been talk
ing about it when she nipped in 
there before Ancient Runes. 
"“And then they spotted me, and ob"
"viously they know I know you, "
so they were bombarding me with
" questions,” Hermione told Harry, "
"her eyes shining, “and Harry, I thin"
"k they believe you, I really do, I "
think you’ve finally 
got them convinced!” 
Meanwhile Professor Umbridge was 
"stalking the school, stopping "
students at random an
d demanding that they 
turn out their books 
and pockets. Harry knew she was looking for copies of 
"The Quibbler,"
but the students were several steps 
ahead of her. The pages carrying 
Harry’s interview had been bewitched to
 resemble extracts from text-
books if anyone but themselves read 
"it, or else wiped magically blank "
until they wanted to peruse it again.
 Soon it seemed that every single 
person in the school had read it. 
"The teachers were, of course, fo"
rbidden from mentioning the in-
terview by Educational Decree Numb
"er Twenty-six, but they found "
ways to express their feelings abou
t it all the same. Professor Sprout 
awarded Gryffindor twenty points when Harry passed her a watering 
can; a beaming Professor Flitwick 
pressed a box of squeaking sugar 
"mice on him at the end of Charms, said “"
Shh
!” and hurried away; and 
Professor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during Divination and 
"announced to the startled class, and a very disapproving Umbridge, "
that Harry was 
not
 going to suffer an early 
"death after all, but would "
   583 "live to a ripe old age, become Mi"
"nister of Magic, and have twelve "
children. 
But what made Harry happiest wa
s Cho catching up with him as 
he was hurrying along to Transfiguration the next day. Before he knew 
what had happened her hand was in his and she was breathing in his 
"ear, “I’m really, really sorry. That "
interview was so brave . . . it made 
me cry.” 
He was sorry to hear she had shed
" even more tears over it, but very "
glad they were on speaking terms 
"again, and even more pleased when "
she gave him a swift kiss on the ch
eek and hurried off again. And un-
"believably, no sooner had he arri"
ved outside Transfiguration than 
something just as good happened: Seam
us stepped out of the queue to 
face him. 
"“I just wanted to say,” he mumble"
"d, squinting at Harry’s left knee, "
“I believe you. And I’ve sent a copy of that magazine to me mam.” 
If anything more was n
eeded to complete Har
"ry’s happiness, it was "
"Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s reaction"
s. He saw them with their heads 
"together later that afternoon in the library, together with a weedy-"
looking boy Hermione whispered 
was called Theodore Nott. They 
looked around at Harry as he br
owsed the shelves for the book he 
"needed on Partial Vanishment, and Go"
yle cracked his knuckles threat-
eningly and Malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to 
Crabbe. Harry knew perfectly well why 
they were acting like this: He 
had named all of 
their fathers as Death Eaters. 
"“And the best bit is,” whispered He"
rmione gleefully as they left the 
"library, “they can’t contradict you,"
 because they can’t admit they’ve 
read the article!” 
"To cap it all, Luna told him "
over dinner that no copy of 
The Quib-
bler
 had ever sold out faster. 
"“Dad’s reprinting!” she told Harry,"
 her eyes popping excitedly. “He 
"can’t believe it, he says people seem even more interested in this than "
the Crumple-Horned Snorkacks!” 
 584 Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night; dar-
"ingly, Fred and George had put an"
 Enlargement Charm on the front 
cover of 
The Quibbler
" and hung it on the wall, so that Harry’s giant "
head gazed down upon the proceedin
"gs, occasionally saying things "
"like “The Ministry are morons” and “Eat dung, Umbridge” in a "
booming voice. Hermione did not find
 this very amusing; she said it 
"interfered with her concentration,"
 and ended up going to bed early 
out of irritation. Harry had to admi
t that the poster was not quite as 
"funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had "
"started to wear off, so that it me"
rely shouted disconnected words like 
“Dung” and “Umbridge” at more an
d more frequent intervals in a 
progressively higher voice. In fact it
 started to make his head ache and 
his scar began prickling uncomforta
bly again. To disappointed moans 
from the many people who were sitti
"ng around him, asking him to re-"
live his interview for the umpteent
"h time, he announced that he too "
needed an early night. 
The dormitory was empty when he re
ached it. He rested his fore-
head for a moment against the cool glass of the window beside his 
bed; it felt soothing against his scar. Then he undressed and got into 
"bed, wishing his headache would go "
away. He also felt slightly sick. 
"He rolled over onto his side, closed "
"his eyes, and fell asleep almost at "
once. . . . 
"He was standing in a dark, curtaine"
d room lit by a single branch of 
candles. His hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of 
him. They were long-fingered and w
hite as though they had not seen 
sunlight for years and looked like la
"rge, pale spiders against the dark "
velvet of the chair. 
"Beyond the chair, in a pool of li"
ght cast upon the floor by the can-
"dles, knelt a man in black robes. "
"“I have been badly advised, it se"
"ems,” said Harry, in a high, cold "
voice that pulsed with anger. 
"“Master, I crave your pardon. . "
. .” croaked the man kneeling on 
   585 the floor. The back of his head glimmered in the candlelight. He 
seemed to be trembling. 
"“I do not blame you, Rookwood,” sa"
id Harry in th
"at cold, cruel "
voice. 
He relinquished his grip upon 
"the chair and walked around it, "
closer to the man cowering upon th
"e floor, until he stood directly over "
"him in the darkness, looking down "
from a far greater height than 
usual. 
“You are sure of 
"your facts, Rookwood?” asked Harry. "
"“Yes, My Lord, yes . . . I used to"
 work in the de
partment after — 
after all. . . .” 
“Avery told me Bode would 
be able to remove it.” 
"“Bode could never have taken it, "
Master. . . . Bode would have 
known he could not. . . . Undoubtedly
 that is why he fought so hard 
against Malfoy’s Impe
rius Curse. . . .” 
"“Stand up, Rookwood,"
” whispered Harry. 
The kneeling man almost 
fell over in his haste 
to obey. His face was 
pockmarked; the scars were thrown in
to relief by the candlelight. He 
remained a little stooped when stan
"ding, as though halfway through a "
"bow, and he darted"
 terrified looks up at Harry’s face. 
“You have done well to tell me this
",” said Harry. “Very well . . . I "
have wasted months on fruitless sche
"mes, it seems. . . . But no matter "
". . . We begin again, from now. You have Lord Voldemort’s gratitude, "
Rookwood. . . .” 
"“My Lord . . . yes, My Lord,” gasped Rookwood, his voice hoarse "
with relief. 
“I shall need your help. I shall need all the information you can give 
me.” 
"“Of course, My Lord, of cour"
se . . . anything . . .” 
“Very well . . . you may 
go. Send Avery to me.” 
"Rookwood scurried backward, bowi"
"ng, and disappeared through a "
door. 
 586 "Left alone in the dark room, Harry turned toward the wall. A "
"cracked, age-spotted mirror hung "
on the wall in the shadows. Harry 
moved toward it. His reflection grew 
larger and clearer in the darkness. 
. . . A face whiter than a skull . . . 
red eyes with slits for pupils . . . 
“NOOOOOOOOO!” 
“What?” yelled a voice nearby. 
"Harry flailed around madly, became"
" entangled in the hangings, and "
fell out of his bed. For a few second
s he did not know where he was; 
he was convinced that he was about 
"to see the white, skull-like face "
looming at him out of the dark ag
"ain, then Ron’s voice spoke very "
near to him. 
“Will you stop acting like a maniac
", and I can get you out of here!” "
"Ron wrenched the hangings apart, "
and Harry stared up at him in 
"the moonlight, as he lay flat on his back, his scar searing with pain. "
Ron looked as though he had just 
been getting ready for bed; one arm 
was out of his robes. 
“Has someone been atta
"cked again?” asked Ron, pulling Harry "
roughly to his feet. “Is it 
Dad? Is it that snake?” 
“No — everyone’s fine —” gasped
" Harry, whose forehead felt as "
though it was on fire again. “Well . . . Avery isn’t. . . . He’s in trouble. 
. . . He gave him the wrong informatio
n. . . . He’s really angry. . . .” 
"Harry groaned and sank, shaking, on"
"to his bed, rubbing his scar. "
“But Rookwood’s going to help him
 now. . . . He’s on the right 
track again. . . .” 
"“What are you talking about?” said Ron, sounding scared. “D’you "
mean . . . did you just
 see You-Know-Who?” 
“I 
was
" You-Know-Who,” said Harry,"
 and he stretched out his 
hands in the darkness and held them up
 to his face to check that they 
were no longer deathly white and long-fingered. “He was with Rook-
"wood, he’s one of the Death Eaters"
" who escaped from Azkaban, re-"
member? Rookwood’s just told him Bode couldn’t have done it. . . .” 
   587 “Done what?” 
“Remove something. . . . He said Bode would have known he 
couldn’t have done it. . . . Bode wa
s under the Imperius Curse. . . . I 
think he said Malfoy’s dad put it on him. . . .” 
“Bode was bewitched to remove 
something?” Ron said. “But — 
"Harry, that’s got to be —” "
"“The weapon,” Harry "
finished the sentence for him. “I know.” 
The dormitory door opened; Dean and Seamus came in. Harry 
swung his legs back into bed. He di
d not want to look as though any-
"thing odd had just happened, seeing as"
 Seamus had only just stopped 
thinking Harry was a nutter. 
"“Did you say,” murmured Ron, putti"
ng his head close to Harry’s on 
the pretense of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside 
"table, “that you "
were
 You-Know-Who?” 
"“Yeah,” said Harry quietly. "
Ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water. Harry saw it spill 
over his chin on
to his chest. 
"“Harry,” he said, as Dean and Se"
"amus clattered around noisily, "
pulling off their robe
"s, and talking, “you’ve got to tell —” "
“I haven’t got to tell 
"anyone,” said Harry shortl"
y. “I wouldn’t have 
seen it at all if I could do Occlum
ency. I’m supposed to have learned 
to shut this stuff out. 
That’s what they want.” 
By “they” he meant Dumbledore. He got back into bed and rolled 
over onto his side with his back to Ron and after a while he heard Ron’s 
mattress creak as he lay back down t
oo. His scar began to burn; he bit 
hard on his pillow to stop himsel
"f making a noise. Somewhere, he "
"knew, Avery was bein"
g punished. . . . 
Harry and Ron waited until break nex
t morning to tell Hermione ex-
actly what had happened. They wanted
 to be absolutely sure they 
could not be overheard. St
anding in their usual corner of the cool and  
 588 "breezy courtyard, Harry "
told her every detail 
of the dream he could 
"remember. When he had finished, sh"
e said nothing at all for a few 
"moments, but stared with a kind "
of painful intens
ity at Fred and 
"George, who were both headless and selling their magical hats from "
under their cloaks on the 
other side of the yard. 
"“So that’s why they killed him,” she said quietly, withdrawing her "
gaze from Fred and George at last
. “When Bode tried to steal this 
"weapon, something funny happened to"
 him. I think there must be 
"defensive spells on it, or around it"
", to stop people from touching it. "
"That’s why he was in St. Mungo’s, his brain had gone all funny and he "
couldn’t talk. But remember what 
the Healer told us? He was recov-
ering. And they couldn’t risk him 
"getting better, could they? I mean, "
the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon prob-
ably made the Imperius Curse lift. 
"Once he’d got his voice back, he’d "
"explain what he’d been doing, woul"
dn’t he? They would have known 
he’d been sent to steal the weapon. 
"Of course, it would have been easy "
for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse 
"on him. Never out of the Ministry, "
is he?” 
"“He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,” said "
Harry. “In the — hang on . . .” he
 said slowly. “He was in the De-
partment of Mysteries corridor that 
day! Your dad said he was proba-
"bly trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing, "
but what if —” 
"“Sturgis,” gasped Hermione"
", looking thunderstruck. "
"“Sorry?” said Ron, looking bewildered. "
"“Sturgis Podmore,” said Hermione, breathlessly. “Arrested for try-"
ing to get through a door. Lucius Ma
lfoy got him too. I bet he did it 
"the day you saw him there, Harry. "
Sturgis had Moody’s Invisibility 
"Cloak, right? So what if he was st"
"anding guard by the door, invisible, "
"and Malfoy heard him move, or guesse"
"d he was there, or just did the "
Imperius Curse on the off chance 
that a guard was there? So when 
Sturgis next had an opportunity — probably when it was his turn on 
   589 guard duty again — he tried to get into the department to steal the 
"weapon for Voldemort — Ron, be quiet — but he got caught and "
sent to Azkaban. . . .” 
She gazed at Harry. 
“And now Rookwood’s told Vold
emort how to get the weapon?” 
"“I didn’t hear all the conversation, "
"but that’s what it sounded like,” "
said Harry. “Rookwood used to work 
there. . . . Maybe Voldemort’ll 
send Rookwood to do it?” 
"Hermione nodded, apparently sti"
"ll lost in thought. Then, quite "
"abruptly, she said, “But you shouldn’t have seen this at all, Harry.” "
"“What?” he said, taken aback. "
“You’re supposed to be learning how 
to close your mind to this sort 
"of thing,” said Hermio"
"ne, suddenly stern. "
"“I know I am,” said Harry. “But —” "
"“Well, I think we should just try and forget what you saw,” said "
Hermione firmly. “And you ought to 
put in a bit more effort on your 
Occlumency from now on.” 
Harry was so angry with he
r that he did not talk
 to her for the rest 
"of the day, which proved to be "
another bad one. When people were 
not discussing the escaped Death Ea
"ters in the corridors today, they "
were laughing at Gryffindor’s ab
ysmal performance in their match 
against Hufflepuff; the Slytherins we
re singing “Weasley Is Our King” 
so loudly and frequently that by 
sundown Filch had banned it from 
the corridors out of
 sheer irritation. 
The week did not improve as it progressed: Harry received two 
"more D’s in Potions, was still on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get "
"the sack, and could not stop himsel"
f from dwelling on the dream in 
"which he had seen Voldemort, though he did not bring it up with Ron "
and Hermione again because he did no
t want another telling-off from 
Hermione. He wished very much that 
he could have talked to Sirius 
"about it, but that was out of the ques"
"tion, so he tried to push the mat-"
ter to the back of his mind. 
 590 "Unfortunately, the back of his mind"
 was no longer the secure place 
it had once been. 
"“Get up, Potter.” "
"A couple of weeks after his dream of Rookwood, Harry was to be "
"found, yet again, kneeling on the floor"
" of Snape’s office, trying to clear "
"his head. He had just been forced, yet "
"again, to relive a stream of very "
early memories he had not even realiz
"ed he still had, most of them "
concerning humiliations Dudley an
d his gang had inflicted upon him 
in primary school. 
"“That last memory,” said "
Snape. “What was it?” 
"“I don’t know,” said Harry, getting "
wearily to his feet. He was find-
ing it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the 
rush of images and sound that Snap
e kept calling forth. “You mean 
the one where my cousin tried to 
make me stand in the toilet?” 
"“No,” said Snape softly. “I mean the one concerning a man kneel-"
ing in the middle of a 
darkened room. . . .” 
"“It’s . . . nothing,” said Harry. "
Snape’s dark eyes bored into 
Harry’s. Remembering what Snape 
had said about eye contact bein
"g crucial to Legilimency, Harry "
blinked and looked away. 
“How do that man and that room 
"come to be inside your head, "
Potter?” said Snape. 
"“It —” said Harry, looking everywhe"
"re but at Snape, “it was — just "
a dream I had.” 
"“A dream,” repeated Snape. "
There was a pause during which Harry 
stared fixedly at a large dead 
frog suspended in a purp
le liquid in its jar. 
"“You do know why we are here, don’t you, Potter?” said Snape in a "
"low, dangerous voice. “You do know why I am giving up my evenings "
to this tedious job?” 
"“Yes,” said Harry stiffly. "
“Remind me why we 
"are here, Potter.” "
   591 "“So I can learn Occlumency,” said Harry, now glaring at a dead eel. "
"“Correct, Potter. And dim though you may be” — Harry looked "
"back at Snape, hating him — “I "
would have thought that after two 
months’ worth of lessons you migh
t have made some progress. How 
many other dreams about the 
Dark Lord have you had?” 
"“Just that one,” lied Harry. "
"“Perhaps,” said Snape, his dark, cold eyes narrowing slightly, “per-"
"haps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams, Potter. "
Maybe they make you feel special — important?” 
"“No, they don’t,” said Harry, hi"
s jaw set and his fingers clenched 
tightly around the handle of his wand. 
"“That is just as well, Potter,” sa"
"id Snape coldly, “because you are "
"neither special nor important, and it "
is not up to you to find out what 
the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters.” 
"“No — that’s your job, isn’"
t it?” Harry shot at him. 
He had not meant to say it; it had burst out of him in temper. For 
a long moment they stared at ea
"ch other, Harry convinced he had "
"gone too far. But there was a curious,"
 almost satisfied expression on 
Snape’s face when
 he answered. 
"“Yes, Potter,” he said, his eyes glinti"
"ng. “That is my job. Now, if you "
"are ready, we will start again. . . .” "
He raised his wand. “One — two — three — 
Legilimens
!” 
A hundred dementors were swoopin
g toward Harry across the lake 
in the grounds. . . . He screwed up
 his face in conc
entration. . . . 
They were coming closer. . . . He
 could see the dark holes beneath 
their hoods . . . yet he could also 
see Snape standing 
"in front of him, "
"his eyes fixed upon Harry’s face, muttering under his breath. . . . And "
"somehow, Snape was growing clearer, and the dementors were grow-"
ing fainter . . . 
Harry raised his own wand. 
“
Protego
!” 
"Snape staggered; his wand flew upward, away from Harry — and "
 592 suddenly Harry’s mind was teeming with memories that were not 
his — a hook-nosed man was shouting
" at a cowering woman, while a "
small dark-haired boy cried in a cor
ner. . . . A greasy-haired teenager 
sat alone in a dark bedr
"oom, pointing his wand at the ceiling, shoot-"
ing down flies. . . . A girl was laughing as a scrawny boy tried to 
mount a bucking broomstick — 
“ENOUGH!” 
Harry felt as though he had been pushed hard in the chest; he took 
"several staggering steps backward, "
hit some of the shelves covering 
Snape’s walls and heard something cr
"ack. Snape was shaking slightly, "
very white in the face. 
The back of Harry’s robes were damp. One of the jars behind him 
had broken when he fell 
against it; the pickled 
slimy thing within was 
swirling in its 
draining potion. 
“
Reparo
"!” hissed Snape, and the jar sealed itself once more. “Well, "
Potter . . . that was cert
ainly an improvement. . 
". .” Panting slightly, "
Snape straightened the Pensieve in 
which he had again stored some of 
his thoughts before starting the less
"on, almost as though checking that "
they were still there. “I don’t re
member telling you to use a Shield 
Charm . . . but there is
 no doubt that it 
was effective. . . .” 
Harry did not speak; he felt that 
to say anything might be danger-
"ous. He was sure he had just broken into Snape’s memories, that he had "
just seen scenes from Sn
"ape’s childhood, and it was unnerving to think "
that the crying little boy who had watched his parents shouting was ac-
tually standing in fron
t of him with such loat
hing in his eyes. . . . 
"“Let’s try again, shal"
l we?” said Snape. 
Harry felt a thrill of dread: He wa
s about to pay for what had just 
"happened, he was sure of it. They mo"
ved back into position with the 
"desk between them, Harry feeling he wa"
s going to find it much harder 
to empty his mind this time. . . . 
"“On the count of three, then,” said"
" Snape, raising his wand once "
more. “One — two —” 
   593 Harry did not have time to gather
 himself together and attempt to 
"clear his mind, for Snap"
e had already cried “
Legilimens
!” 
He was hurtling along the corridor toward the Department of Mys-
"teries, past the blank stone walls, "
past the torches — the plain black 
door was growing ever larger; he was 
moving so fast he was going to 
"collide with it, he was feet from it "
and he could see that chink of faint 
blue light again — 
The door had flown open! He was thro
"ugh it at last, inside a black-"
"walled, black-floored circular room lit with blue-flamed candles, and "
there were more doors all around 
him — he needed to go on — but 
which door ought he to take — ? 
“POTTER!” 
Harry opened his eyes. He was fl
at on his back again with no 
memory of having gotten th
ere; he was also pant
ing as though he re-
ally had run the length of the Depa
"rtment of Mysteries corridor, really "
had sprinted through the black door 
and found the circular room. . . . 
"“Explain yourself!” said Snape, who was standing over him, look-"
ing furious. 
"“I . . . dunno what happened,” said Harry truthfully, standing up. "
There was a lump on the back of his
 head from where he had hit the 
"ground and he felt feverish. “I’ve never seen that before. I mean, I told "
"you, I’ve dreamed about the door . . "
. but it’s never opened before. . . .” 
“You are not workin
g hard enough!” 
"For some reason, Snape seemed ev"
en angrier than he had done two 
"minutes before, when Harry had "
seen into his own memories. 
"“You are lazy and sloppy, Potter, it is small wonder that the Dark "
Lord —” 
"“Can you tell me something, "
sir
"?” said Harry, firing up again. "
"“Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord, I’ve only ever heard "
Death Eaters call him that —” 
Snape opened his mouth in a snar
l — and a woman screamed from 
somewhere outside the room. 
 594 Snape’s head jerked 
upward; he was gazing at the ceiling. 
“What the — ?” he muttered. 
Harry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what he 
thought might be the entrance hall.
" Snape looked around at him, "
frowning. 
"“Did you see anything unusual on your way down here, Potter?” "
Harry shook his head. Somewh
"ere above them, the woman "
screamed again. Snape strode to his 
"office door, his wand still held at "
"the ready, and swept out of sight."
" Harry hesitated for a moment, then "
followed. 
The screams were indeed coming fr
om the entrance hall; they grew 
louder as Harry ran toward the sto
ne steps leading up from the dun-
geons. When he reached the top 
he found the entrance hall packed. 
Students had come flooding out of
" the Great Hall, where dinner was "
"still in progress, to see what was going on. Others had crammed them-"
selves onto the marble staircase. 
Harry pushed forward through a knot 
of tall Slytherins and saw that th
"e onlookers had formed a great ring, "
"some of them looking shocked, ot"
hers even frightened. Professor 
McGonagall was directly opposite Ha
rry on the other side of the hall; 
she looked as though what she wa
s watching made 
her feel faintly 
sick. 
Professor Trelawney was standing in the middle of the entrance hall 
with her wand in one hand and an
" empty sherry bottle in the other, "
"looking utterly mad. Her hair was sticking up on end, her glasses were "
lopsided so that one eye was magnif
ied more than the other; her in-
numerable shawls and scarves were trailing haphazardly from her 
"shoulders, giving the impression "
that she was falling apart at the 
"seams. Two large trunks lay on the floor beside her, one of them up-"
side down; it looked very much as
 though it had been thrown down 
the stairs after her. Professor Trel
"awney was staring, apparently terri-"
"fied, at something Harry could not s"
ee but that seemed to be standing 
at the foot of the stairs. 
   595 “No!” she shrieked. “NO! This cann
ot be happening. . . . It cannot 
. . . I refuse to
 accept it!” 
“You didn’t realize this was comi
ng?” said a high
" girlish voice, "
"sounding callously amused, and Harry,"
 moving slightly
" to his right, "
saw that Trelawney’s terrifying vision was nothing other than Professor 
Umbridge. “Incapable though you 
are of predicting even tomorrow’s 
"weather, you must surely have real"
ized that your pitiful performance 
"during my inspections, and lack of"
" any improvement, would make it "
inevitable you would be sacked?” 
"“You c-can’t!” howled Professor Trelawney, tears streaming down "
her face from behind her enormous l
"enses, “you c-can’t sack me! I’ve "
b-been here sixteen years! H-Hogwarts is m-my h-home!” 
“It 
was
" your home,” said Professor Umbridge, and Harry was re-"
volted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face as she watched 
"Professor Trelawney sink, sobbing "
"uncontrollably, onto one of her "
"trunks, “until an hour ago, when th"
e Minister of Magic countersigned 
the order for your dismissal. Now ki
ndly remove yourself from this 
hall. You are embarrassing us.” 
"But she stood and watched, with an"
 expression of gloating enjoy-
"ment, as Professor Trelawney shud"
"dered and moaned, rocking back-"
ward and forward on her trunk in 
paroxysms of grief. Harry heard a 
sob to his left and looked around. 
Lavender and Parvati were both cry-
"ing silently, their arms around each other. Then he heard footsteps. "
"Professor McGonagall had broken away from the spectators, marched "
straight up to Professor Trelawney 
and was patting her firmly on the 
back while withdrawing a large hand
kerchief from within her robes. 
"“There, there, Sibyll . . . Calm down"
. . . . Blow your nose on this. 
". . . It’s not as bad as you think, no"
w. . . . You are not 
going to have to 
leave Hogwarts. . . .” 
"“Oh really, Professor McGonagall?”"
 said Umbridge in a deadly 
"voice, taking a few steps forward. “And your authority for that state-"
ment is . . . ?” 
 596 "“That would be mine,” "
said a deep voice. 
The oak front doors had swung open. Students beside them scut-
tled out of the way as Dumbledore appeared in the entrance. What he 
had been doing out in the ground
"s Harry could not imagine, but "
there was something impressive about the sight of him framed in the 
doorway against an oddly misty nigh
t. Leaving the doors wide behind 
"him, he strode forward through the "
circle of onlookers toward the 
"place where Professor Trelawney sat,"
" tearstained and trembling, upon "
"her trunk, Professor McGonagall alongside her. "
"“Yours, Professor Dumbledore?” said Umbridge with a singularly "
unpleasant little laugh. “I’m afraid you do not understand the posi-
tion. I have here” — she pulled a parchment scroll from within her 
robes — “an Order of Dismissal signed
 by myself and the Minister of 
Magic. Under the terms of Educatio
"nal Decree Number Twenty-three, "
"the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts has the power to inspect, place upon "
"probation, and sack any teacher she "
"— that is to say, I — feel is not "
performing up to the standard required by the Ministry of Magic. I 
have decided that Professor Trelawney 
is not up to scratch. I have dis-
missed her.” 
"To Harry’s very great surprise, Dumb"
ledore continued to smile. He 
"looked down at Professor Trelawney,"
 who was still sobbing and chok-
"ing on her trunk, and said, “You are quite right, of course, Professor "
Umbridge. As High Inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my 
"teachers. You do not, however, have "
the authority to send them away 
"from the castle. I am afraid,” he we"
"nt on, with a courteous little bow, "
“that the power to do that still resi
"des with the headmaster, and it is "
my wish that Professor Trelawney continue to live at Hogwarts.” 
"At this, Professor Trelawney gave a wild little laugh in which a hic-"
cup was barely hidden. 
"“No — no, I’ll g-go, Dumbledore! "
I sh-shall l-leave Hogwarts and 
s-seek my fortune elsewhere —” 
   597 "“No,” said Dumbledore sharply. “It is my wish that you remain, "
Sibyll.” 
He turned to Professor McGonagall. 
“Might I ask you to escort Si
"byll back upstairs, Professor "
McGonagall?” 
"“Of course,” said McGonagall. "
"“Up you get, Sibyll. . . .” "
Professor Sprout came hurrying forward out of the crowd and 
grabbed Professor Trelawney’s other 
arm. Together they guided her 
past Umbridge and up the marble st
airs. Professor Flitwick went scur-
"rying after them, his wand held "
"out before him; he squeaked, “"
Loco-
motor trunks
!” and Professor Trelawney’s luggage rose into the air and 
"proceeded up the staircase after her, "
Professor Flitwick bringing up the 
rear. 
Professor Umbridge was standing 
"stock-still, staring at Dumble-"
"dore, who continued "
to smile benignly. 
"“And what,” she said in a whispe"
r that nevertheless carried all 
"around the entrance hall, “are you go"
ing to do with her once I appoint 
a new Divination teacher 
who needs her lodgings?” 
"“Oh, that won’t be a problem,” "
said Dumbledore pleasantly. “You 
"see, I have already found us a new Di"
"vination teacher, and he will pre-"
fer lodgings on th
e ground floor.” 
“You’ve found — ?” said Umbridge shrilly. “
You’ve
 found? Might I 
"remind you, Dumbledore, that "
under Educational Decree Twenty-
two —” 
“— the Ministry has the right to a
ppoint a suitable candidate if — 
and only if — the headmaster is un
"able to find one,” said Dumble-"
dore. “And I am happy to say that 
on this occasion I have succeeded. 
May I introduce you?” 
He turned to face the open front 
"doors, through which night mist "
was now drifting. Harry heard hoov
es. There was a shocked murmur 
around the hall and those nearest th
e doors hastily moved even farther  
 598 "backward, some of them tripping over"
 in their haste to clear a path for 
the newcomer. 
Through the mist came a face 
Harry had seen once before on a 
"dark, dangerous night in the Forbi"
dden Forest: white-blond hair and 
"astonishingly blue eyes, the head "
and torso of a man joined to the 
palomino body of a horse. 
"“This is Firenze,” said Dumble"
dore happily to a thunderstruck 
Umbridge. “I think you’ll
 find him suitable.” 
’ll bet you wish you hadn’t given 
"up Divination now, don’t you, "
"Hermione?” asked Parvati, smirking. "
It was breakfast time a few days
 after the sacking of Professor 
"Trelawney, and Parvati was curling he"
r eyelashes around her wand and 
examining the effect in the back of 
her spoon. They were to have their 
first lesson with Fire
nze that morning. 
"“Not really,” said Hermione in"
"differently, who was reading the "
Daily Prophet.
 “I’ve never really liked horses.” 
She turned a page of the news
"paper, scanning its columns. "
"“He’s not a horse, he’s a centaur!” said Lavender, sounding shocked. "
“A 
gorgeous
 centaur . . .” sighed Parvati. 
"“Either way, he’s still got four legs,” said Hermione coolly. “Any-"
"way, I thought you two were all "
upset that Trelawney had gone?” 
“We are!” Lavender assured her. “W
e went up to her office to see 
"her, we took her some daffodils — "
not the honking ones that Sprout’s 
"got, nice ones. . . .” "
“How is she?” asked Harry. 
"“Not very good, poor thing,” said"
 Lavender sympathetically. “She 
I 
 600 was crying and saying sh
e’d rather leave the castle forever than stay 
"here if Umbridge is still here, and I don’t blame her. Umbridge was "
"horrible to her, wasn’t she?” "
“I’ve got a feeling Umbridge has on
"ly just started being horrible,” "
said Hermione darkly. 
"“Impossible,” said Ron, who was tu"
cking into a large plate of eggs 
and bacon. “She can’t get any wo
rse than she’s been already.” 
"“You mark my words, she’s going to want revenge on Dumbledore "
for appointing a new teacher withou
"t consulting her,” said Hermione, "
closing the newspaper. “Especially another part-human. You saw the 
look on her face when 
she saw Firenze. . . .” 
After breakfast Hermione departed
 for her Arithmancy class and 
Harry and Ron followed Parvati and La
"vender into the entrance hall, "
heading for Divination. 
"“Aren’t we going up to North Tower?” asked Ron, looking puzzled, "
as Parvati bypassed the marble staircase. 
Parvati looked scornfully over her shoulder at him. 
“How d’you expect Firenze to cl
imb that ladder? We’re in class-
"room eleven now, it was on "
the notice board yesterday.” 
Classroom eleven was situated in 
the ground-floor corridor leading 
off the entrance hall on the opposite side to the Great Hall. Harry 
knew it to be one of those classroom
"s that were never used regularly, "
and that it therefore had the slightly
 neglected feeling of a cupboard or 
storeroom. When he entered it 
"right behind Ron, and found him-"
self right in the middle of a forest
" clearing, he was therefore momen-"
tarily stunned. 
“What the — ?” 
The classroom floor had become 
springily mossy and trees were 
growing out of it; their leafy bran
ches fanned across the ceiling and 
"windows, so that the room was full of"
" slanting shafts of soft, dappled, "
green light. The students who had al
ready arrived were sitting on the 
"earthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders, "
   601 arms wrapped around their knees or 
"folded tightly across their chests, "
looking rather nervous. In the mi
"ddle of the room, where there were "
"no trees, stood Firenze. "
"“Harry Potter,” he said, holding out a hand when Harry entered. "
"“Er — hi,” said Harry, shaking ha"
"nds with the centaur, who sur-"
veyed him unblinkingly through thos
e astonishingly blue eyes but did 
not smile. “Er — good 
to see you . . .” 
"“And you,” said the centaur, in"
clining his white-blond head. “It 
was foretold that we would meet again.” 
Harry noticed that there was the sh
adow of a hoof-shaped bruise 
on Firenze’s chest. As he turned to join the rest of the class upon the 
"floor, he saw that they were all looking at him with awe, apparently "
deeply impressed that he was on sp
"eaking terms with Firenze, whom "
they seemed to find intimidating. 
When the door was closed and the last student had sat down upon 
a tree stump beside the wastepaper 
"basket, Firenze gestured around "
the room. 
“Professor Dumbledore has kindly a
"rranged this classroom for us,” "
"said Firenze, when everyone had settled down, “in imitation of my "
natural habitat. I would have prefer
red to teach you in the Forbidden 
"Forest, which was — until Monday — my home . . . but this is not "
possible.” 
“Please — er — sir —” said Parvat
"i breathlessly, raising her hand, "
“why not? We’ve been 
"in there with Hagrid, "
we’re not frightened!” 
“It is not a question of your braver
"y,” said Firenze, “but of my po-"
sition. I can no longer return to th
e forest. My herd has banished me.” 
“Herd?” said Lavender in a co
"nfused voice, and Harry knew she "
was thinking of cows. “What — oh!” Comprehension dawned on her 
face. “There are 
more of you
"?” she said, stunned. "
"“Did Hagrid breed you, like the "
thestrals?” asked Dean eagerly. 
Firenze turned his head very slowly
" to face Dean, who seemed to "
realize at once
 that he had said so
mething very offensive. 
 602 "“I didn’t — I meant — sorry,” he"
 finished in a hushed voice. 
“Centaurs are not the servants or
" playthings of humans,” said "
"Firenze quietly. There was a pause, th"
en Parvati raised her hand again. 
"“Please, sir . . . why have the "
other centaurs banished you?” 
“Because I have agreed to work 
"for Professor Dumbledore,” said "
Firenze. “They see this as a betrayal of our kind.” 
"Harry remembered how, nearly four"
" years ago, the centaur Bane "
had shouted at Firenze 
for allowing Harry to ri
de to safety upon his 
"back, calling him a “common mule.”"
 He wondered whether it had 
been Bane who ha
d kicked Firenze in the chest. 
"“Let us begin,” said Firenze. He"
" swished his long palomino tail, "
raised his hand toward the leafy 
canopy overhead then lowered it 
"slowly, and as he did so, the light "
in the room dimmed
", so that they "
now seemed to be sitting in a fore
"st clearing by twilight, and stars "
emerged upon the ceiling. There were 
oohs
" and gasps, and Ron said "
"audibly, “Blimey!” "
"“Lie back upon the floor,” said Fi"
"renze in his calm voice, “and ob-"
"serve the heavens. Here is written, "
"for those who can see, the fortune "
of our races.” 
Harry stretched out on his back and 
gazed upward at the ceiling. A 
twinkling red star winked
 at him from
 overhead. 
“I know that you have learned th
e names of the planets and their 
"moons in Astronomy,” said Firenze’"
"s calm voice, “and that you have "
mapped the stars’ progress through 
the heavens. Centaurs have unrav-
eled the mysteries of these movem
ents over centuries. Our findings 
teach us that the future
 may be glimpsed in th
e sky above us. . . .” 
“Professor Trelawney did Astrology wi
"th us!” said Parvati excitedly, "
raising her hand in front of her so th
at it stuck up in the air as she lay 
"on her back. “Mars causes accidents and burns and things like that, "
"and when it makes an angle to Saturn, like now” — she drew a right "
angle in the air above her — “that me
ans that people need to be extra 
careful when handling hot things —” 
   603 "“That,” said Firenze calm"
"ly, “is human nonsense.” "
Parvati’s hand fell li
mply to her side. 
"“Trivial hurts, tiny human accidents,” said Firenze, as his hooves "
thudded over the mossy floor. “These 
are of no more significance than 
the scurryings of ants to the wide
" universe, and are unaffected by "
planetary movements.” 
“Professor Trelawney —” began Parv
"ati, in a hurt and indignant "
voice. 
"“— is a human,” said Firenze simply. “And is therefore blinkered "
and fettered by the limitations of your kind.” 
Harry turned his head very slightly 
to look at Parvati. She looked very 
"offended, as did se"
veral of the people
 surrounding her. 
"“Sibyll Trelawney may have Seen, I do not know,” continued "
"Firenze, and Harry heard the swishing "
of his tail again as he walked up 
"and down before them, “but she wast"
"es her time, in the main, on the "
self-flattering nonsense humans call 
"fortune-telling. I, however, am "
here to explain the wisdom of cent
"aurs, which is impersonal and im-"
partial. We watch the skie
s for the great tides of evil or change that are 
sometimes marked there. It may take 
ten years to be sure of what we 
are seeing.” 
Firenze pointed to the red st
ar directly above Harry. 
"“In the past decade, the indication"
s have been that Wizard-kind is 
living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars. 
"Mars, bringer of battle, shines brig"
"htly above us, suggesting that the "
fight must break out again soon. Ho
"w soon, centaurs may attempt to "
divine by the burning of certain he
"rbs and leaves, by the observation "
of fume and flame. . . .” 
It was the most unusual lesson Ha
rry had ever attended. They did 
indeed burn sage and mallowsweet 
"there on the classroom floor, and "
Firenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pun-
"gent fumes, but he seemed perfec"
tly unconcerned that not one of 
them could see any of the signs he de
"scribed, telling them that humans "
 604 "were hardly ever good at this, that "
it took centaurs years and years to 
"become competent, and finished by telling them that it was foolish to "
"put too much faith in such things anyway, because even centaurs "
sometimes read them wrongly. 
He was nothing like any human 
teacher Harry had ever had. His prio
rity did not seem to be to teach 
"them what he knew, but rather to "
"impress upon them that nothing, "
"not even centaurs’ knowledge, was foolproof. "
"“He’s not very definite on anything, "
"is he?” said Ron in a low voice, "
as they put out their mallowsweet fi
"re. “I mean, I could do with a few "
more details about this war we’r
"e about to have, couldn’t you?” "
The bell rang right outside th
e classroom door and everyone 
jumped; Harry had completely forgotten 
that they were still inside the 
"castle, quite convinced that he was re"
ally in the forest. The class filed 
"out, looking slightly perplexed; "
Harry and Ron were on the point of 
"following them when Firenze called, “Harry Potter, a word, please.” "
Harry turned. The centaur advanc
ed a little toward him. Ron 
hesitated. 
"“You may stay,” "
Firenze told him. “But 
"close the door, please.” "
Ron hastened to obey. 
"“Harry Potter, you are a friend of"
" Hagrid’s, are you not?” said the "
centaur. 
"“Yes,” said Harry. "
“Then give him a warning from me
. His attempt is not working. 
He would do better to abandon it.” 
“His attempt is not working?
” Harry repeated blankly. 
"“And he would do better to abandon it,” said Firenze, nodding. “I "
"would warn Hagrid myself, but I am"
 banished — it would be unwise 
for me to go too near the forest 
"now — Hagrid has troubles enough, "
without a centaurs’ battle.” 
“But — what’s Hagrid attempting to do?” said Harry nervously. 
Firenze looked at Harry impassively. 
“Hagrid has recently rendered me 
"a great service,” said Firenze, "
   605 “and he has long since earned my re
spect for the care he shows all liv-
ing creatures. I shall not betray his 
secret. But he must be brought to 
his senses. The attempt is not workin
"g. Tell him, Harry Potter. Good "
day to you.” 
The happiness Harry had fel
t in the aftermath of 
The Quibbler
 inter-
view had long since evaporated. As 
a dull March blurred into a squally 
"April, his life seemed to have beco"
me one long series of worries and 
problems again. 
Umbridge had continued attending 
all Care of Magical Creatures 
"lessons, so it had been very difficult to deliver Firenze’s warning to Ha-"
grid. At last Harry had ma
naged it by pretending 
he had lost his copy 
of 
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
 and doubling back after 
class one day. When he passed on Fi
"renze’s message, Hagrid gazed at "
"him for a moment through his puffy,"
" blackened eyes, apparently taken "
aback. Then he seemed to pull himself together. 
"“Nice bloke, Firenze,” he said gruf"
"fly, “but he don’ know what he’s "
talkin’ abou’ on this. The at
temp’s comin’ on fine.” 
"“Hagrid, what’re you up to?” as"
ked Harry seriously. “Because 
"you’ve got to be careful, Umbridge"
 has already sacked Trelawney and 
"if you ask me, she’s on a roll. If you’re doing anything you shouldn’t "
be —” 
“There’s things more importan’ th
"an keepin’ a job,” said Hagrid, "
though his hands shook slightly as he 
said this and a basin full of knarl 
"droppings crashed to the floor. “Don’ worry abou’ me, Harry, jus’ get "
"along now, there’s "
a good lad. . . .” 
Harry had no choice but to leave 
Hagrid mopping up
 the dung all 
"over his floor, but he felt thoroughly dispirited as he trudged back up "
to the castle. 
"Meanwhile, as the teachers and Hermione persisted in reminding "
"them, the O.W.L.s were drawing ever nearer. All the fifth years were "
"suffering from stress to some degree,"
 but Hannah Abbott became the 
 606 first to receive a Calming Draugh
t from Madam Pomfrey after she 
burst into tears during Herbology an
d sobbed that she was too stupid 
to take exams and wanted
 to leave school now. 
If it had not been for the D.A. 
"lessons, Harry thought he would "
have been extremely unhappy. He so
metimes felt that he was living 
"for the hours he spent in the Room of Requirement, working hard but "
thoroughly enjoying himself at the sa
"me time, swelling with pride as "
he looked around at his fellow 
D.A. members and saw how far they 
"had come. Indeed, Harry sometime"
s wondered how Umbridge was 
going to react when all the member
s of the D.A. received “Outstand-
ing” in their Defense Agains
t the Dark Arts O.W.L.s. 
They had finally started work on
" Patronuses, which everybody had "
"been very keen to practice, though "
"as Harry kept reminding them, "
producing a Patronus in the middle
 of a brightly lit classroom when 
they were not under threat was ve
ry different to producing it when 
confronted by something like a dementor. 
"“Oh, don’t be such a killjoy,” sa"
"id Cho brightly, watching her sil-"
very swan-shaped Patronus soar ar
ound the Room of Requirement 
during their last lesson before Easter. “They’re so pretty!” 
"“They’re not supposed to be pretty, they’re supposed to protect "
"you,” said Harry patiently. “What we re"
ally need is a boggart or some-
"thing; that’s how I learned, I had "
to conjure a Patronus while the bog-
gart was pretending to
 be a dementor —” 
“But that would be really scary!
"” said Lavender, who was shooting "
puffs of silver vapor out of the 
end of her wand. “And I still — 
can’t — do it!” sh
e added angrily. 
Neville was having trouble too. Hi
s face was screwed up in concen-
"tration, but only feeble wisps of silv"
er smoke issued from his wand tip. 
"“You’ve got to think of something happy,” Harry reminded him. "
"“I’m trying,” said Neville misera"
"bly, who was trying so hard his "
round face was actually
 shining with sweat. 
"“Harry, I think I’m doing it!”"
" yelled Seamus, who had been "
   607 brought along to his first ever D.A
. meeting by Dean. “Look — ah — 
it’s gone. . . . But it was defi
"nitely something hairy, Harry!” "
"Hermione’s Patronus, a shining silv"
"er otter, was gamboling around "
her. 
“They 
are
" sort of nice, aren’t they?” "
"she said, looking at it fondly. "
The door of the Room of Requir
ement opened and then closed 
again; Harry looked around to see 
"who had entered, but there did not "
seem to be anybody there. It was 
a few moments before he realized 
that the people close to the door ha
"d fallen silent. Next thing he knew, "
something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee. He 
"looked down and saw, to his very great astonishment, Dobby the "
house-elf peering up at him from
 beneath his usual eight hats. 
"“Hi, Dobby!” he said. “Wha"
t are you — what’s wrong?” 
For the elf’s eyes were wide with terror and he was shaking. The 
members of the D.A. closest to Harry had fallen silent now: Every-
body in the room was watching Do
bby. The few Patronuses people 
had managed to conjure faded away in
"to silver mist, leaving the room "
looking much darker than before. 
"“Harry Potter, sir . . .” squeaked "
"the elf, trembling from head to "
"foot, “Harry Potter, sir . . . Dobby "
has come to warn you . . . but the 
house-elves have been warn
ed not to tell . . .” 
He ran headfirst at the wall: Ha
"rry, who had some experience of "
"Dobby’s habits of self-punishment, made to seize him, but Dobby "
"merely bounced off the stone, cus"
hioned by his eight hats. Hermione 
and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy. 
"“What’s happened, Dobby?” Harry asked, grabbing the elf’s tiny "
arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek 
to hurt himself. 
“Harry Potter . . . she . . . she . . .” 
Dobby hit himself hard on the nose
 with his free fist: Harry seized 
that too. 
"“Who’s ‘she,’ Dobby?” "
 608 But he thought he knew — surely only one “she” could induce 
such fear in Dobby? The elf looked up
" at him, slightly cross-eyed, and "
mouthed wordlessly. 
“Umbridge?” asked 
"Harry, horrified. "
"Dobby nodded, then tried to bang"
 his head off Harry’s knees; 
Harry held him at bay. 
“What about her? Dobby — she hasn’t found out about this — 
about us — about the D.A.?” 
He read the answer in the elf’s stri
cken face. His hands held fast by 
"Harry, the elf tried to kick "
himself and fell
 to the floor. 
“Is she coming?” Ha
rry asked quietly. 
"Dobby let out a howl, and began be"
ating his bare feet hard on the 
"floor. “Yes, Harry Potter, yes!” "
Harry straightened up and looked 
"around at the motionless, terri-"
fied people gazing at the thrashing elf. 
“WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?” Harry bellowed. “RUN!” 
"They all pelted toward the exit at once, forming a scrum at the "
"door, then people burst through; "
Harry could hear them sprinting 
along the corridors and hoped they ha
d the sense not to try and make 
it all the way to their dormitories. It
" was only ten to nine, if they just "
took refuge in the library or the 
"Owlery, which were both nearer — "
"“Harry, come on!” shrieked Hermio"
ne from the center of the knot 
of people now fighting to get out. 
"He scooped up Dobby, who was stil"
l attempting to do himself seri-
"ous injury, and ran with the elf in "
his arms to join the back of the 
queue. 
“Dobby — this is an order — ge
t back down to the kitchen with 
"the other elves, and if she asks yo"
"u whether you warned me, lie and say "
no!” said Harry. “And I forbid you to
" hurt yourself!” he added, drop-"
ping the elf as he made it over th
e threshold at last
 and slamming the 
door behind him. 
"“Thank you, Harry Potter!” squeaked"
" Dobby, and he streaked off. "
   609 "Harry glanced left and right, the others"
 were all moving so fast that he 
caught only glimpses of flying heel
s at either end of the corridor be-
fore they vanished. He started to 
run right; there was a boys’ bath-
"room up ahead, he could pretend he’d"
 been in there all the time if he 
could just reach it — 
“AAARGH!” 
Something caught him around the an
"kles and he fell spectacularly, "
skidding along on his front for six f
eet before coming to a halt. Some-
one behind him was laughing. He ro
lled over onto his back and saw 
Malfoy concealed in a niche bene
ath an ugly dragon-shaped vase. 
"“Trip Jinx, Potter!” he said. “Hey"
", Professor — PROFESSOR! I’ve "
got one!” 
Umbridge came bustling around
" the far corner, breathless but "
wearing a delighted smile. 
“It’s him!” she said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor. “Ex-
"cellent, Draco, excellent, oh, very good "
— fifty points to Slytherin! I’ll 
"take him from here. . . . Stand up, Potter!” "
"Harry got to his feet, glaring at the "
pair of them. He had never seen 
Umbridge looking so happy. She seized his arm in a vicelike grip and 
"turned, beaming broadly, to Malfoy"
. “You hop along and see if you 
"can round up anymore of them, Drac"
"o,” she said. “Tell the others to "
look in the library — 
anybody out of breath 
"— check the bathrooms, "
Miss Parkinson can do the girls’ on
"es — off you go — and you,” she "
"added in her softest, most dangerou"
"s voice, as Malfoy walked away. "
“You can come with me to the 
"headmaster’s office, Potter.” "
They were at the stone gargoyle
 within minutes. Harry wondered 
how many of the others had been ca
ught. He thought of Ron — Mrs. 
Weasley would kill him — and of how Hermione would feel if she 
was expelled before she could take 
her O.W.L.s. And it had been Sea-
mus’s very first meeting . . . and Neville had been getting so good. . . . 
"“Fizzing Whizbee,” sang Umbridge, and the stone gargoyle jumped "
"aside, the wall behind split open, an"
d they ascended the moving stone 
 610 "staircase. They reached the polished door with the griffin knocker, but "
"Umbridge did not bother to knock, "
"she strode straight inside, still "
holding tight to Harry. 
The office was full of people. 
Dumbledore was sitting behind his 
"desk, his expression serene, the tips of his long fingers together. Pro-"
"fessor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him, her face extremely tense. "
"Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magi"
"c, was rocking backward and for-"
"ward on his toes beside the fire, "
apparently immensely pleased with 
the situation. Kingsley Shacklebol
t and a tough-look
ing wizard Harry 
"did not recognize with very short, wi"
ry hair were positioned on either 
"side of the door like guards, and th"
"e freckled, bespectacled form of "
"Percy Weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall, a quill and a heavy "
"scroll of parchment in his hands, "
apparently poised to take notes. 
The portraits of old headmasters and mistresses were not sham-
ming sleep tonight. All of them were watching what was happening 
"below, alert and serious. As Har"
"ry entered, a few flitted into neigh-"
boring frames and whispered urgent
ly into their neighbors’ ears. 
Harry pulled himself free of Umbridge’s grasp as the door swung 
shut behind them. Cornelius Fudge wa
s glaring at him with a kind of 
vicious satisfaction upon his face. 
"“Well,” he said. “Well,"
" well, well . . .” "
Harry replied with the dirtiest l
ook he could muster. His heart 
"drummed madly inside him, but his "
brain was oddly cool and clear. 
“He was heading back to Gryffind
"or Tower,” said Umbridge. There "
"was an indecent excitement in her voice, the same callous pleasure "
Harry had heard as she watched Professor Trelawney dissolving with 
misery in the entrance
 hall. “The Malfoy boy cornered him.” 
"“Did he, did he?” said Fudge appr"
eciatively. “I must remember to 
"tell Lucius. Well, Potter"
 . . . I expect you kn
ow why you are here?” 
Harry fully intended to respond wi
th a defiant “yes”: His mouth 
had opened and the word was half fo
rmed when he caught sight of  
   611 Dumbledore’s face. Dumbledore was 
not looking directly at Harry; 
"his eyes were fixed upon a point just over his shoulder, but as Harry "
"stared at him, he shook his head a "
fraction of an in
ch to each side. 
Harry changed direction mid-word. 
“Yeh — no.” 
“I beg your pardon?” said Fudge. 
"“No,” said Harry, firmly. "
“You 
don’t
 know why you are here?” 
"“No, I don’t,” "
said Harry. 
Fudge looked incredulously from
 Harry to Professor Umbridge; 
Harry took advantage of his moment
ary inattention to steal another 
"quick look at Dumbledore, who gave"
 the carpet the tiniest of nods 
and the shadow of a wink. 
"“So you have no idea,” said Fudge "
in a voice positive
ly sagging with 
"sarcasm, “why Professor Umbridge ha"
s brought you to this office? You 
are not aware that 
you have broken any school rules?” 
“School rules?” sa
id Harry. “No.” 
“Or Ministry decrees?” am
ended Fudge angrily. 
"“Not that I’m aware of,” said Harry blandly. "
His heart was still hammering very 
fast. It was almost worth telling 
these lies to watch Fudge’s blood pre
"ssure rising, but he could not see "
how on earth he would get away wi
th them. If somebody had tipped 
off Umbridge about the D.A. then he
", the leader, might as well be "
packing his trunk right now. 
"“So it’s news to you, is it,” sa"
"id Fudge, his voic"
e now thick with 
"anger, “that an illegal "
student organization has 
been discovered within 
this school?” 
"“Yes, it is,” said Harry, hoisting "
an unconvincing look of innocent 
surprise onto his face. 
"“I think, Minister,” said Umbrid"
"ge silkily from beside him, “we "
might make better progress 
if I fetch our informant.” 
 612 "“Yes, yes, do,” said Fudge, noddi"
"ng, and he glance"
d maliciously at 
Dumbledore as Umbridge left the r
oom. “There’s nothing like a good 
"witness, is there, Dumbledore?” "
"“Nothing at all, Cornelius,” said"
" Dumbledore gravely, inclining his "
head. 
There was a wait of several minute
"s, in which nobody looked at "
"each other, then Harry heard the "
door open behind him. Umbridge 
"moved past him into the room, gri"
pping by the shoulder Cho’s curly-
haired friend Marietta
", who was hiding her face in her hands. "
"“Don’t be scared, dear, don’t be"
" frightened,” said Professor Um-"
"bridge softly, patting her on the ba"
"ck, “it’s quite all right, now. You "
have done the right thing. The minister
 is very pleased with you. He’ll 
be telling your mother what a good 
"girl you’ve been. Marietta’s mother, "
"Minister,” she added, looking up"
" at Fudge, “is Madam Edgecombe "
from the Department of Magical 
Transportation. Floo Network of-
fice — she’s been helpin
g us police the Hogwar
"ts fires, you know.” "
"“Jolly good, jolly good!” said Fu"
dge heartily. “Lik
"e mother, like "
"daughter, eh? Well, come on, now, de"
"ar, look up, don’t be shy, let’s "
hear what you’ve got to
 — galloping gargoyles!” 
"As Marietta raised her head, Fudg"
"e leapt backward in shock, nearly "
landing himself in the fire. He cursed and stamped on the hem of his 
"cloak, which had started to smoke,"
 and Marietta gave a wail and 
pulled the neck of her robes right up
" to her eyes, but not before the "
whole room had seen that her face wa
s horribly disfigured by a series 
of close-set purple pustules that ha
d spread across her nose and cheeks 
to form the word “SNEAK.” 
"“Never mind the spots now, dear,” "
"said Umbridge impatiently, “just "
take your robes away from your 
mouth and tell the Minister —” 
But Marietta gave another muff
led wail and shook her head 
frantically. 
"“Oh, very well, you silly girl, "
I’ll
" tell him,” snapped Umbridge. She "
hitched her sickly smile back onto 
"her face and said, “Well, Minister, "
   613 Miss Edgecombe here came to my 
office shortly after dinner this 
evening and told me she had someth
ing she wanted to tell me. She 
"said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor, some-"
times known as the Room of Requ
"irement, I would find out some-"
thing to my advantage. I questioned her a little further and she 
admitted that there was to be some
 kind of meeting there. Unfortu-
"nately at that point this hex,” she "
waved impatiently at Marietta’s con-
"cealed face, “came into operation an"
d upon catching sight of her face 
in my mirror the girl became too 
distressed to tell me any more.” 
"“Well, now,” said Fudge, fixing "
Marietta with what he evidently 
imagined was a kind and fatherly l
"ook. “It is very brave of you, my "
"dear, coming to tell Professor Umbridge, you did exactly the right "
"thing. Now, will you tell me what happened at this meeting? What "
was its purpose? Who was there?” 
But Marietta would not speak. Sh
"e merely shook her head again, "
her eyes wide and fearful. 
“Haven’t we got a counterjinx fo
r this?” Fudge asked Umbridge 
"impatiently, gesturing at Marietta’s"
 face. “So she can speak freely?” 
“I have not yet managed to find
" one,” Umbridge admitted grudg-"
"ingly, and Harry felt a surge of prid"
e in Hermione’s jinxing ability. 
“But it doesn’t matter if she won’t sp
"eak, I can take up"
 the story from 
here. 
"“You will remember, Minister, that "
I sent you a report back in Oc-
tober that Potter had met a number 
of fellow students in the Hog’s 
Head in Hogsmeade —” 
“And what is your evidence for th
at?” cut in Professor McGonagall. 
"“I have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who hap-"
pened to be in the bar at
 the time. He was heavil
"y bandaged, it is true, "
but his hearing was quite unimpair
"ed,” said Umbridge smugly. “He "
heard every word Potter said and hast
ened straight to the school to re-
port to me —” 
"“Oh, so "
that’s
 why he wasn’t prosecuted
 for setting up all those 
 614 regurgitating toilets!” said Pro
"fessor McGonagall, raising her eye-"
brows. “What an interesting insight into our justice system!” 
“Blatant corruption!” roared the 
"portrait of the corpulent, red-"
nosed wizard on the wall behind Du
mbledore’s desk. “The Ministry 
"did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not!” "
"“Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,” said Dumbledore softly. "
"“The purpose of Potter’s meeting with these students,” continued "
"Professor Umbridge, “was to persuade them to join an illegal society, "
whose aim was to learn spells and 
curses the Ministry has decided are 
inappropriate for school-age —” 
“I think you’ll find you’re wrong 
"there, Dolores,” said Dumbledore "
"quietly, peering at her over the ha"
lf-moon spectacles perched halfway 
down his crooked nose. 
Harry stared at him. He could not see how Dumbledore was going 
to talk him out of this one; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard 
every word he said in the Hog’s Head
 there was simply no escaping it. 
"“Oho!” said Fudge, bouncing up "
and down on the balls of his feet 
"again. “Yes, do let’s hear the latest "
cock-and-bull story designed to pull 
"Potter out of trouble! Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on — Willy "
"Widdershins was lying, was he? Or was "
it Potter’s identical twin in the 
Hog’s Head that day? Or is there the usual simple explanation involv-
"ing a reversal of time, a dead man co"
"ming back to life, and a couple of "
invisible dementors?” 
Percy Weasley let ou
t a hearty laugh. 
"“Oh, very good, Minister, very good!” "
Harry could have kicked him. Then 
"he saw, to his astonishment, "
that Dumbledore was sm
iling gently too. 
"“Cornelius, I do not deny — and nor, I am sure, does Harry — "
that he was in the Hog’s Head that 
"day, nor that he was trying to re-"
cruit students to a Defense Against 
the Dark Arts group. I am merely 
pointing out that Dolores is quite 
wrong to suggest that such a group 
"was, at that time, illegal. If yo"
"u remember, the Ministry decree ban-"
   615 ning all student societies was not pu
t into effect until two days after 
"Harry’s Hogsmeade meeting, so he wa"
s not breaking any rules in the 
Hog’s Head at all.” 
Percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something 
"very heavy. Fudge remained motionless in mid-bounce, his mouth "
hanging open. 
Umbridge recovered first. 
"“That’s all very fine, Headmaster,”"
" she said, smiling sweetly. “But "
we are now nearly six months on fr
om the introduction of Educational 
"Decree Number Twenty-four. If the first meeting was not illegal, all "
those that have ha
ppened since most certainly are.” 
"“Well,” said Dumbledore, surveying her with polite interest over "
"the top of his interlocked fingers, “they certainly "
would
" be, if they "
had
continued after the decree came into
 effect. Do you have any evidence 
that these meetings continued?” 
"As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard "
a rustle behind him and rather 
thought Kingsley whispered somethin
g. He could have
 sworn too that 
"he felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a "
"draft or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there. "
“Evidence?” repeated Umbridge wi
th that horrible wide toadlike 
smile. “Have you not been listenin
"g, Dumbledore? Why do you think "
Miss Edgecombe is here?” 
"“Oh, can she tell us about six mo"
nths’ worth of meetings?” said 
"Dumbledore, raising his eyebrows. “I"
 was under the impression that 
she was merely reporting a meeting tonight.” 
"“Miss Edgecombe,” said Umbridge at"
" once, “tell us how long these "
"meetings have been going on, dear. "
You can simply nod or shake your 
"head, I’m sure that won’t make th"
e spots worse. Have they been hap-
pening regularly over the last six months?” 
Harry felt a horrible plummeting in 
"his stomach. This was it, they "
had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even Dumbledore would 
be able to shift aside. . . . 
 616 "“Just nod or shake your head, dear,” Umbridge said coaxingly to "
"Marietta. “Come on, now, that won’t activate the jinx further. . . .” "
Everyone in the room was gazing at 
the top of Marietta’s face. Only 
her eyes were visible between the pu
lled up robes and her curly fringe. 
Perhaps it was a trick of
" the firelight, but her "
eyes looked oddly blank. 
And then — to Harry’s utter amazem
ent — Marietta shook her head. 
Umbridge looked quickly at Fudg
e and then back
 at Marietta. 
“I don’t think you unde
"rstood the question, did you, dear? I’m ask-"
ing whether you’ve been going to 
these meetings for the past six 
"months? You have, haven’t you?” "
"Again, Marietta shook her head. "
“What do you mean by shaking your
" head, dear?” said Umbridge "
in a testy voice. 
“I would have thought her meaning 
"was quite clear,” said Professor "
McGonagall harshly. “There have b
een no secret meetings for the past 
"six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?” "
Marietta nodded. 
“But there was a meeting tonigh
t!” said Umbridge furiously. 
"“There was a meeting, Miss Edgecomb"
"e, you told me about it, in the "
"Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter "
"organized it, Potter — "
"why are you shaking your head, girl"
?” 
"“Well, usually when a person shakes"
" their head,” said McGonagall "
"coldly, “they mean ‘no.’ So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of "
sign language as yet unknown to humans —” 
"Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, "
"pulled her around to face her, "
and began shaking her very hard. A 
split second later Dumbledore was 
"on his feet, his wand raised. Kingsley started forward and Umbridge "
"leapt back from Marietta, waving he"
r hands in the air as though they 
had been burned. 
“I cannot allow you to manhandl
"e my students, Dolores,” said "
"Dumbledore, and for the firs"
"t time, he looked angry. "
"“You want to calm yourself, Mada"
"m Umbridge,” said Kingsley in "
   617 "his deep, slow voice. “You don’t wa"
nt to get yourself into trouble 
now.” 
"“No,” said Umbridge breathlessly, "
glancing up at the towering fig-
"ure of Kingsley. “I mean, yes — you’re right, Shacklebolt — I — I "
forgot myself.” 
Marietta was standing exactly wh
ere Umbridge had released her. 
She seemed neither perturbed by 
"Umbridge’s sudden attack, nor re-"
lieved by her release. She was stil
l clutching her robe
 up to her oddly 
"blank eyes, staring straight ahead of her. A sudden suspicion con-"
nected to Kingsley’s whisper and the 
thing he had felt shoot past him 
sprang into Harry’s mind. 
"“Dolores,” said Fudge, with the "
air of trying to settle something 
"once and for all, “the meeting toni"
ght — the one we know definitely 
happened —” 
"“Yes,” said Umbridge, pulling hersel"
"f together, “yes . . . well, Miss "
Edgecombe tipped me off and I proc
eeded at once to the seventh 
"floor, accompanied by certain "
trustworthy
" students, so as to catch "
those in the meeting red-handed. It 
appears that they were forewarned 
"of my arrival, however, because when we reached the seventh floor "
they were running in every directio
"n. It does not matter, however. I "
"have all their names here, Miss Pa"
rkinson ran into the Room of Re-
quirement for me to see if they ha
d left anything behind. . . . We 
needed evidence and the 
room provided . . .” 
"And to Harry’s horror, she withdrew"
 from her pocket the list of 
names that had been pinned upon th
e Room of Requirement’s wall 
and handed it to Fudge. 
“The moment I saw Potter
"’s name on the list, I knew what we were "
"dealing with,” she said softly. "
"“Excellent,” said Fudge, a smile "
spreading across his face. “Excel-
"lent, Dolores. And . . "
. by thunder . . .” 
"He looked up at Dumbledore, who "
was still standing beside Mari-
"etta, his wand held "
loosely in his hand. 
 618 “See what they’ve named themselves?” said Fudge quietly. “
Dum-
bledore’s Army.
” 
Dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from 
Fudge. He gazed at the heading sc
ribbled by Hermione months be-
fore and for a moment seemed unable
" to speak. Then he looked up, "
smiling. 
"“Well, the game is up,” he said "
simply. “Would you like a written 
"confession from me, Cornelius — or"
 will a statement before these 
witnesses 
suffice?” 
Harry saw McGonagall and Kingsley 
look at each other. There was 
fear in both faces. He did not unde
"rstand what was going on, and nei-"
"ther, apparently, did Fudge. "
“Statement?” said Fudge sl
owly. “What — I don’t — ?” 
"“Dumbledore’s Army, Cornelius,” sa"
"id Dumbledore, still smiling as "
he waved the list of names before
 Fudge’s face. “Not Potter’s Army. 
Dumbledore’s Army.
” 
“But — but —” 
Understanding blazed suddenly in Fudge’s face. He took a horrified 
"step backward, yelped, and jump"
ed out of the fire again. 
"“You?” he whispered, stamping "
again on his smoldering cloak. 
"“That’s right,” said Dumbledore pleasantly. "
“You organized this?” 
"“I did,” said Dumbledore. "
“You recruited these students for — for your army?” 
"“Tonight was supposed to be the first meeting,” said Dumbledore, "
nodding. “Merely to see whether they
 would be interested in joining 
me. I see now that it was a mistak
"e to invite Miss Edgecombe, of "
course.” 
Marietta nodded. Fudge looked fr
"om her to Dumbledore, his chest "
swelling. 
“Then you 
have
 been plotting agai
nst me!” he yelled. 
"“That’s right,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. "
   619 “NO!” shouted Harry. 
Kingsley flashed a look of warn
"ing at him, McGonagall widened "
"her eyes threateningly, but it ha"
d suddenly dawned upon Harry what 
Dumbledore was about to
" do, and he could "
not let it happen. 
“No — Professor 
Dumbledore!” 
"“Be quiet, Harry, or I am afraid yo"
"u will have to leave my office,” "
said Dumbledore calmly. 
"“Yes, shut up, Potter!” barked Fudg"
"e, who was still ogling Dumble-"
dore with a kind of horrified deligh
"t. “Well, well, well — I came here "
tonight expecting to expe
l Potter and instead —” 
"“Instead you get to arrest me,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It’s like "
losing a Knut and findin
"g a Galleon, isn’t it?” "
"“Weasley!” cried Fudge, now positively quivering with delight, "
"“Weasley, have you written it all "
"down, everything he’s said, his con-"
"fession, have you got it?” "
"“Yes, sir, I think so, sir!” said Pe"
"rcy eagerly, whose nose was splat-"
tered with ink from the sp
eed of his note-taking. 
“The bit about how he’s
 been trying to build up an army against 
"the Ministry, how he’s been working to destabilize me?” "
"“Yes, sir, I’ve got it, yes!” said "
"Percy, scanning his notes joyfully. "
"“Very well, then,” said Fudge, no"
w radiant with glee. “Duplicate 
"your notes, Weasley, an"
d send a copy to the 
Daily Prophet
 at once. If 
we send a fast owl we should 
make the morning edition!” Percy 
"dashed from the room, slamming the door behind him, and Fudge "
turned back to Dumbledore. “You wi
ll now be escorted back to the 
"Ministry, where you will be formally"
 charged and then sent to Azka-
ban to await trial!” 
"“Ah,” said Dumbledore gently, “yes. Yes, I thought we might hit "
that little snag.” 
"“Snag?” said Fudge, his voice still vi"
"brating with joy. “I see no snag, "
Dumbledore!” 
"“Well,” said Dumbledore apologetically, “I’m afraid I do.” "
 620 “Oh really?” 
“Well — it’s just that you seem to
 be laboring under the delusion 
that I am going to — what is the ph
rase? ‘Come quietly’
 I am afraid I 
"am not going to come quietly at all,"
 Cornelius. I have absolutely no 
intention of being sent 
to Azkaban. I could br
"eak out, of course — "
"but what a waste of time, and frankl"
"y, I can think of a whole host of "
things I would ra
ther be doing.” 
Umbridge’s face was growing steadi
"ly redder, she looked as though "
she was being filled with boiling 
water. Fudge stared at Dumbledore 
"with a very silly expression on his face, as though he had just been "
stunned by a sudden blow and coul
d not quite beli
eve it had hap-
pened. He made a small choking no
ise and then looked around at 
Kingsley and the man with short gr
"ay hair, who alone of everyone in "
the room had remained entirely silent
 so far. The latter gave Fudge a 
"reassuring nod and moved forward a little, away from the wall. Harry "
"saw his hand drift, almost "
"casually, toward his pocket. "
"“Don’t be silly, Dawlish,” said "
Dumbledore kindly. “I’m sure you 
"are an excellent Auror, I seem to "
remember that you achieved ‘Out-
"standing’ in all your N.E.W.T.s, bu"
t if you attempt to — er — ‘bring 
"me in’ by force, I will"
 have to hurt you.” 
"The man called Dawlish blinked, look"
ing rather foolish. He looked 
"toward Fudge again, but this time seem"
ed to be hoping 
for a clue as to 
what to do next. 
"“So,” sneered Fudge, recovering him"
"self, “you intend to take on "
"Dawlish, Shacklebolt, Dolores, an"
"d myself single-handed, do you, "
Dumbledore?” 
"“Merlin’s beard, no,” said Dumb"
"ledore, smiling. “Not unless you "
are foolish enough to force me to.” 
“He will not be single-handed!” sa
"id Professor McGonagall loudly, "
plunging her hand inside her robes. 
"“Oh yes he will, Minerva!” said"
 Dumbledore sharply. “Hogwarts 
needs you!” 
   621 "“Enough of this rubbish!” said Fudge, pulling out his own wand. "
“Dawlish! Shacklebolt! 
Take him
!” 
A streak of silver light flashed 
around the room. There was a bang 
"like a gunshot, and the floor trembl"
ed. A hand grabbed the scruff of 
Harry’s neck and forced him down on the floor as a second silver flash 
went off — several of the portrait
"s yelled, Fawkes screeched, and a "
cloud of dust filled the air. Coughi
"ng in the dust, Harry saw a dark fig-"
ure fall to the ground with a crash 
in front of him. There was a shriek 
"and a thud and somebody cried, “No!” Then the sound of breaking "
"glass, frantically scuffling foot"
"steps, a groan — and silence. "
Harry struggled around to see who was half-strangling him and saw 
Professor McGonagall crouched beside him. She had forced both him 
and Marietta out of harm’s way. Du
st was still floating gently down 
through the air onto them. Panting 
"slightly, Harry saw a very tall fig-"
ure moving toward them. 
“Are you all right?
” said Dumbledore. 
“Yes!” said Professor McGonagall
", getting up and dragging Harry "
and Marietta with her. 
The dust was clearing. The wrecka
ge of the office loomed into 
view: Dumbledore’s desk had been ov
"erturned, all of the spindly ta-"
"bles had been knocked to the floor, "
their silver instruments in pieces. 
"Fudge, Umbridge, Kingsley, and Dawl"
ish lay motionless on the floor. 
Fawkes the phoenix soared in wide 
"circles above them, singing softly. "
"“Unfortunately, I had to hex Kingsley"
" too, or it would have looked "
"very suspicious,” said "
Dumbledore in a low vo
ice. “He was remark-
"ably quick on the uptake, modify"
ing Miss Edgecombe’s memory like 
"that while everyone was looking the other way — thank him for me, "
"won’t you, Minerva? "
"“Now, they will all awake very soon "
and it will be best if they do 
not know that we had t
ime to communicate — you must act as though

"ground, they will not remember —” "
 622 "“Where will you go, Dumbledore?"
” whispered Professor McGona-
gall. “Grimmauld Place?” 
"“Oh no,” said Dumbledore with a gr"
im smile. “I am not leaving to 
go into hiding. Fudge will soon wi
sh he’d never dislodged me from 
"Hogwarts, I promise you. . . .” "
“Professor Dumbledore . 
. .” Harry began. 
He did not know what to say first: how sorry he was that he had 
started the D.A. in the first place an
"d caused all this trouble, or how "
terrible he felt that Dumbledore was leaving to save him from expul-
sion? But Dumbledore cut him off b
efore he could say another word. 
"“Listen to me, Harry,” he said ur"
"gently, “you must study Occlu-"
"mency as hard as you can, do you "
understand me? Do everything Pro-
fessor Snape tells you and practice it
 particularly every night before 
sleeping so that you can close your
 mind to bad dreams — you will 
"understand why soon enough, "
but you must promise me —” 
The man called Dawlish was stir
ring. Dumbledore seized Harry’s 
wrist. 
“Remember — close your mind —” 
But as Dumbledore’s fingers closed
" over Harry’s skin, a pain shot "
"through the scar on his forehead, and he felt again that terrible, snake-"
"like longing to strike Dumbledore, to bite him, to hurt him — "
"“— you will understand,”"
 whispered Dumbledore. 
Fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him. Dumbledore 
"released Harry, raised his hand, and "
grasped the phoenix’s long golden 
tail. There was a flash of fire 
and the pair of them had gone. 
"“Where is he?” yelled Fudge, pu"
shing himself up from the ground. 
“
Where is he
?” 
“I don’t know!” shouted Kingsl
"ey, also leapin"
g to his feet. 
"“Well, he can’t have Disapparated!” cried Umbridge. “You can’t in-"
side this school —” 
"“The stairs!” cried Dawlish, an"
"d he flung himself upon the door, "
"wrenched it open, and disappeared, "
followed closely by Kingsley and 
   623 "Umbridge. Fudge hesitated, then got "
"to his feet slowly, brushing dust "
from his front. There was a 
long and painful silence. 
"“Well, Minerva,” said Fudge nastily, straightening his torn shirt-"
"sleeve, “I’m afraid this is the "
end of your friend Dumbledore.” 
"“You think so, do you?” said Pr"
ofessor McGonagall scornfully. 
Fudge seemed not to hear her. He was looking around at the 
wrecked office. A few of the portra
its hissed at him; one or two even 
made rude hand gestures. 
“You’d better get those two off to be
"d,” said Fudge, looking back at "
Professor McGonagall with a di
smissive nod toward Harry and 
Marietta. 
"She said nothing, but marched Harry and Marietta to the door. As "
"it swung closed behind them, Harry "
heard Phineas Nigellus’s voice. 
"“You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts "
. . . but you cannot deny 
he’s got style. . . .” 
—
  by order of
—
The Ministry of Magic 
Dolores Jane Umbridge (High Inquisitor) has replaced Al-
bus Dumbledore as Head of Ho
gwarts School of Witchcraft 
and Wizardry. 
The above is in accordance with 
Educational Decree Number Twenty-eight.
Signed: 
minister of magic 
The notices had gone up all over th
"e school overnight, but they did "
not explain how every single person 
within the castle seemed to know 
   625 that Dumbledore had overcome two 
"Aurors, the High Inquisitor, the "
"Minister of Magic, and his Junior"
 Assistant to escape. No matter 
where Harry went within the castle 
"next day, the sole topic of conver-"
"sation was Dumbledore’s flight, and "
though some of 
the details might 
have gone awry in the retelling (Harry overheard one second-year girl 
assuring another that Fudge was 
now lying in St. Mungo’s with a 
"pumpkin for a head), it was surprising how accurate the rest of their "
information was. Everybody seemed 
"aware, for instance, that Harry "
and Marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in 
"Dumbledore’s office, and as Marietta"
" was now in the hospital wing, "
Harry found himself besieged with 
requests to give a firsthand ac-
count wherever he went. 
“Dumbledore will be back before 
"long,” said Ernie Macmillan con-"
fidently on the way back from Herb
ology after listening intently to 
Harry’s story. “They couldn’t keep him away in our second year and 
they won’t be able to this time. The 
Fat Friar told me . . .” He dropped 
"his voice conspiratorially, so that"
" Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to "
"lean closer to him to hear, “. . . that Umbridge tried to get back into his "
office last night after they’d searched the castle and grounds for him. 
Couldn’t get past the gargoyle. The Head
’s office has sealed itself against 
her.” Ernie smirked. “Apparently she 
had a right little tantrum. . . .” 
"“Oh, I expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the Head’s "
"office,” said Hermione viciously, as "
they walked up the stone steps into 
"the entrance hall. “Lording it over all the other teachers, the stupid "
"puffed-up, power-crazy old —” "
"“Now, do you "
really
" want to finish that sentence, Granger?” "
Draco Malfoy had slid out from
" behind the door, followed by "
"Crabbe and Goyle. His pale, pointe"
d face was alight with malice. 
“Afraid I’m going to have to dock 
a few points from Gryffindor and 
"Hufflepuff,” he drawled. "
“It’s only teachers that can dock po
"ints from Houses, Malfoy,” said "
Ernie at once. 
 626 "“Yeah, we’re prefects too,"
 remember?” snarled Ron. 
“I know 
prefects
" can’t dock points, Weasel"
" King,” sneered Malfoy; "
Crabbe and Goyle snig
gered. “But members of the Inquisitorial 
Squad —” 
“The 
what
?” said Hermione sharply. 
"“The Inquisitorial Squad, Granger,"
"” said Malfoy, pointing toward a "
tiny silver I upon his robes just beneath his prefect’s badge. “A select 
group of students who are supportive 
"of the Ministry of Magic, hand-"
"picked by Professor Umbridge. Anyway, members of the Inquisitorial "
Squad 
do
 have the power to dock points. 
". . . So, Granger, I’ll have five "
from you for being rude about our 
"new headmistress. . . . Macmillan, "
five for contradicting me. . . . Five 
"because I don’t like you, Potter . . . "
"Weasley, your shirt’s untucked, so I’ll "
have another five for that. . . . Oh 
"yeah, I forgot, you’re a Mudblood, "
"Granger, so ten for that. . . .” "
"Ron pulled out his wand, but Herm"
"ione pushed it away, whisper-"
"ing, “Don’t!” "
"“Wise move, Granger,” breathed Malfoy. “New Head, new times "
". . . Be good now, Potty . . . Weasel King . . .” "
"He strode away, laughing hearti"
ly with Crabbe and Goyle. 
"“He was bluffing,” said Ernie, l"
ooking appalled. “He can’t be al-
lowed to dock points . . . that woul
d be ridiculous. . . . It would com-
pletely undermine the pr
efect system. . . .” 
"But Harry, Ron, and Hermione ha"
d turned automatically toward 
"the giant hourglasses set in niches along the wall behind them, which "
recorded the House points. Gryffindor and Ravenclaw had been neck 
and neck in the lead that morning. 
"Even as they watched, stones flew "
"upward, reducing the amounts in th"
"e lower bulbs. In fact, the only "
glass that seemed unchanged was the 
emerald-filled one of Slytherin. 
"“Noticed, have you?” "
said Fred’s voice. 
He and George had just come down the marble staircase and joined 
"Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie "
in front of the hourglasses. 
“Malfoy just docked us all about fift
"y points,” said Harry furiously, "
   627 as they watched several more stones fly upward from the Gryffindor 
hourglass. 
"“Yeah, Montague trie"
d to do us during 
"break,” said George. "
"“What do you mean, ‘tried’?” said Ron quickly. "
“He never managed to get all the wo
"rds out,” said Fred, “due to the "
fact that we forced him
 headfirst into that Vanishing Cabinet on the 
first floor.” 
Hermione looked very shocked. 
“But you’ll get into terrible trouble!” 
"“Not until Montague reappears, and that could take weeks, I "
"dunno where we sent him,” said Fr"
ed coolly. “Anyway . . . we’ve de-
cided we don’t care about ge
tting into trou
ble anymore.” 
“Have you ever?” asked Hermione. 
"“’Course we have,” said George. "
"“Never been expelled, have we?” "
“We’ve always known where to 
"draw the line,” said Fred. "
“We might have put a toe across 
"it occasionally,”"
 said George. 
“But we’ve always stopped short 
"of causing real mayhem,” said "
Fred. 
“But now?” said Ron tentatively. 
"“Well, now —” said George. "
“— what with Dumbledor
e gone —” said Fred. 
“— we reckon a bit of 
mayhem —” said George. 
“— is exactly what 
"our dear new Head deserves,” said Fred. "
“You mustn’t!” whispered Hermione. “You really mustn’t! She’d 
love a reason to expel you!” 
"“You don’t get it, Hermione, do yo"
"u?” said Fred, smiling at her. "
“We don’t care about staying anymore.
 We’d walk out right now if we 
weren’t determined to do our bit for 
"Dumbledore first. So anyway,” he "
"checked his watch, “phase one is ab"
out to begin. I’d get in the Great 
"Hall for lunch if I were you, that "
way the teachers will see you can’t 
have had anything 
to do with it.” 
“Anything to do with what?” 
said Hermione anxiously. 
 628 "“You’ll see,” said Geor"
"ge. “Run along, now.” "
Fred and George turned away an
d disappeared in the swelling 
crowd descending the stairs toward
 lunch. Looking highly discon-
"certed, Ernie muttered something about unfinished Transfiguration "
homework and scurried away. 
“I think we 
should
" get out of here, you know,” said Hermione ner-"
vously. “Just in
 case . . .” 
"“Yeah, all right,” said Ron, and th"
e three of them moved toward the 
"doors to the Great Hall, but Harry had "
barely glimpsed today’s ceiling 
of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoul-
"der and, turning, he found himself almost nose to nose with Filch, the "
caretaker. He took several hasty st
eps backward; Filch was best viewed 
at a distance. 
"“The headmistress would like to see you, Potter,” he leered. "
"“I didn’t do it,” said Harry stupid"
"ly, thinking of whatever Fred and "
George were planning. Filch’s jowl
s wobbled with silent laughter. 
"“Guilty conscience, eh?” he "
wheezed. “Follow me. . . .” 
Harry glanced back at Ron and He
"rmione, who were both looking "
worried. He shrugged and followed Fi
"lch back into the entrance hall, "
against the tide of hungry students. 
Filch seemed to be in an extr
emely good mood; he hummed creak-
ily under his breath as they climbed the marble staircase. As they 
"reached the first landing he said, “Things are changing around here, "
Potter.” 
"“I’ve noticed,” said Harry coldly. "
“Yerse . . . I’ve been telling Dumbledore for years and years he’s too 
"soft with you all,” said Filch, chuckling nastily. “You filthy little beasts "
would never have dropped Stinkpellets
 if you’d known I had it in my 
"power to whip you raw, would "
"you, now? Nobody would have "
thought of throwing Fanged Frisb
ees down the corridors if I could’ve 
"strung you up by the ankles in my office, would they? But when Edu-"
cational Decree Twenty-nine comes in
", Potter, I’ll be allowed to do "
   629 them things. . . . 
And
 she’s asked the Minister to sign an order for the 
"expulsion of Peeves. . . . Oh, thin"
gs are going to be very different 
around here with 
her
 in charge. . . .” 
Umbridge had obviously 
gone to some lengths to get Filch on her 
"side, Harry thought, and the worst of"
 it was that he would probably 
prove an important weapon; his know
ledge of the school’s secret pas-
sageways and hiding places was probably second only to the Weasley 
twins. 
"“Here we are,” he said, leering dow"
n at Harry as he rapped three 
times upon Professor Umbridge’s door and pushed it open. “The Pot-
"ter boy to see you, ma’am.” "
"Umbridge’s office, so very familiar to Harry from his many deten-"
"tions, was the same as usual exce"
pt for the large wooden block lying 
across the front of her desk on whic
h golden letters spelled the word 
"HEADMISTRESS; also his Firebolt, and Fred’s and George’s Clean-"
"sweeps, which he saw with a pang "
were now chained 
and padlocked to 
a stout iron peg in the wall behind 
the desk. Umbridge was sitting be-
"hind the desk, busily scribbling upon"
" some of her pink parchment, "
but looked up and smiled 
widely at their entrance. 
"“Thank you, Argus,” she said sweetly. "
"“Not at all, ma’am, not at all,” "
"said Filch, bowing as low as his "
rheumatism would permit
", and exiting backward. "
"“Sit,” said Umbridge curtly, pointi"
"ng toward a chair, and Harry sat. "
She continued to scribble for a few 
moments. He watched some of the 
"foul kittens gamboling around the plates over her head, wondering "
what fresh horror she 
had in store for him. 
"“Well now,” she said finally, setting down her quill and looking "
like a toad about to swallow a part
icularly juicy fly.
 “What would you 
like to drink?” 
"“What?” said Harry, quite su"
re he had misheard her. 
"“To drink, Mr. Potter,” she said, smiling still more widely. “Tea? "
Coffee? Pumpkin juice?” 
 630 "As she named each drink, she ga"
"ve her short wand a wave, and a "
cup or glass of it ap
peared upon her desk. 
"“Nothing, thank you,” said Harry. "
"“I wish you to have a drink with me,” she said, her voice becoming "
more dangerously sweet. “Choose one.” 
"“Fine . . . tea then,” sa"
"id Harry, shrugging. "
She got up and made quite a perfor
mance of adding 
milk with her 
back to him. She then bustled around
" the desk with it, smiling in sin-"
isterly sweet fashion. 
"“There,” she said, handing it to him."
" “Drink it before it gets cold, "
"won’t you? Well, now, Mr. Potter . . "
. I thought we ought to have a lit-
"tle chat, after the distressing"
 events of last night.” 
He said nothing. She settled herself back into her seat and waited. 
When several long moments had passe
"d in silence, she said gaily, "
“You’re not drinking up!” 
He raised the cup to his lips and 
"then, just as suddenly, lowered it. "
One of the horrible painted kittens 
behind Umbridge had great round 
blue eyes just like Mad-Eye Moody’s
" magical one, and it had just oc-"
curred to Harry what Mad-Eye would sa
y if he ever he
ard that Harry 
had drunk anything offered
 by a known enemy. 
“What’s the matter?” said Umbrid
"ge, who was still watching him. "
“Do you want sugar?” 
"“No,” said Harry. "
He raised the cup to his lips ag
"ain and pretended to take a sip, "
though keeping his mout
h tightly closed. Umbrid
ge’s smile widened. 
"“Good,” she whispered. “Very good. Now then . . .” She leaned "
forward a little. “
Where is Albus Dumbledore
?” 
"“No idea,” said Harry promptly. "
"“Drink up, drink up,” she said, st"
"ill smiling. “Now, Mr. Potter, let "
us not play childish games. I know
 that you know where he has gone. 
You and Dumbledore have been in this
 together from the beginning. 
Consider your position
", Mr. Potter. . . .” "
   631 “I don’t know where he is.” 
Harry pretended to drink again. 
"“Very well,” said Umbridge, lookin"
"g displeased. “In that case, you "
will kindly tell me the wh
ereabouts of Sirius Black.” 
Harry’s stomach turned over and 
his hand holding the teacup 
shook so that the cup rattled in its saucer. He tilted the cup to his 
"mouth with his lips pressed together, so that some of the hot liquid "
trickled down onto his robes. 
"“I don’t know,” he sa"
id a little too quickly. 
"“Mr. Potter,” said Umbridge, “let "
me remind you that it was I who 
almost caught the criminal Black in 
the Gryffindor fire in October. I 
know perfectly well it was you he
 was meeting and if I had had any 
proof neither of you would be at la
"rge today, I promise you. I repeat, "
Mr. Potter . . . Wher
e is Sirius Black?” 
"“No idea,” said Harry loudly. “Haven’t got a clue.” "
They stared at each other so long
 that Harry felt his eyes watering. 
Then she stood up. 
"“Very well, Potter, I will take your word for it this time, but be "
warned: The might of the Ministry 
stands behind me. All channels of 
communication in and out of this sc
hool are being monitored. A Floo 
Network Regulator is keeping watch 
over every fire in Hogwarts — 
"except my own, of course. My In"
quisitorial Squad is opening and 
reading all owl post entering and le
aving the castle. And Mr. Filch is 
observing all secret passages in and 
out of the castle. If I find a shred 
of evidence . . .” 
BOOM!
The very floor of the office sh
"ook; Umbridge slipped sideways, "
"clutching her desk for support, looking shocked. "
“What was — ?” 
She was gazing toward the door; 
Harry took the opportunity to 
empty his almost full cup of tea into 
the nearest vase of dried flowers. 
He could hear people 
running and screaming 
several floors below. 
 632 "“Back to lunch with you, Potte"
"r!” cried Umbridge, raising her "
wand and dashing out of the office. 
Harry gave her a few seconds’ start 
then hurried after her to
 see what the source of
 all the uproar was. 
It was not difficult to find. O
"ne floor down, pandemonium reigned. "
Somebody (and Harry had a very sh
rewd idea who) had set off what 
seemed to be an enormous cr
ate of enchanted fireworks. 
Dragons comprised entirely of gree
n-and-gold sparks were soaring 
"up and down the corridors, emitting"
 loud fiery blasts and bangs as 
they went. Shocking-pink Catherine wh
eels five feet in diameter were 
whizzing lethally through the air like
 so many flying saucers. Rockets 
with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls. 
Sparklers were writing swearwords in midair of their own accord. Fire-
crackers were exploding like mine
"s everywhere Harry looked, and in-"
"stead of burning themselves out, fadi"
"ng from sight, or fizzling to a "
"halt, these pyrotechnical miracles s"
eemed to be gaining in energy and 
momentum the longer he watched. 
"Filch and Umbridge were standing, apparently transfixed with hor-"
"ror, halfway down the stairs. As Harry watched, one of the larger "
Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more 
room to maneuver; it whirled towa
rd Umbridge and Filch with a sin-
ister 
wheeeeeeeeee.
 Both adults yelled with fright and ducked and it 
soared straight out of the window
 behind them and off across the 
"grounds. Meanwhile, several of the "
dragons and a large purple bat that 
was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end 
of the corridor to escape
 toward the second floor. 
"“Hurry, Filch, hurry!” shrieked Um"
bridge. “They’ll be all over the 
school unless we do something — 
Stupefy
!” 
A jet of red light shot out of the 
end of her wand and hit one of the 
rockets. Instead of freezing in midair
", it exploded with such force that "
it blasted a hole in a painting of
 a soppy-looking witch in the middle 
"of a meadow — she ran for it just in time, reappearing seconds later  "
   633 squashed into the pain
"ting next door, where a co"
uple of wizards play-
ing cards stood up hastily 
to make room for her. 
"“Don’t Stun them, Filch!” shouted Umbridge angrily, for all the "
world as though it ha
d been his suggestion. 
"“Right you are, Headmistress!” wheezed Filch, who was a Squib "
and could no more have Stunned th
e fireworks than swallowed them. 
"He dashed to a nearby cupboard, pulled out a broom, and began swat-"
ting at the fireworks in midair; wi
thin seconds the he
ad of the broom 
was ablaze. 
"Harry had seen enough. Laughing, he"
" ducked down low, ran to a "
door he knew was concealed behind 
a tapestry a little way along the 
corridor and slipped through it to 
find Fred and George hiding just 
"behind it, listening to Umbridge’s and Filch’s yells and quaking with "
suppressed mirth. 
"“Impressive,” Harry said quietly, "
grinning. “Very impressive . . . 
You’ll put Dr. Filibuster out of
" business, no problem. . . .” "
"“Cheers,” whispered George, wiping tears of laughter from his face. "
"“Oh, I hope she tries Vanishing them"
 next. . . . They multiply by ten 
every time you try. . . .” 
The fireworks continued to burn an
d to spread all over the school 
that afternoon. Though they caused 
"plenty of disruption, particularly "
"the firecrackers, the other teachers "
did not seem to mind them very 
much. 
"“Dear, dear,” said Professor McGona"
"gall sardonically, as one of the "
dragons soared around her classroom
", emitting loud bangs and exhal-"
"ing flame. “Miss Brown, would you "
mind running along to the head-
mistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our 
classroom?” 
The upshot of it all was that Professor Umbridge spent her first af-
ternoon as headmistress running al
l over the school answering the 
"summonses of the other teachers, none of whom seemed able to rid  "
 634 their rooms of the fireworks without 
her. When the final bell rang and 
the students were heading back to 
"Gryffindor Tower with their bags, "
"Harry saw, with immense satisfaction"
", a disheveled and soot-blackened "
Umbridge tottering sweaty-faced fr
om Professor Flitwick’s classroom. 
"“Thank you so much, Professor!” said Professor Flitwick in his "
squeaky little voice. “I could have 
"got rid of the sparklers myself, of "
"course, but I wasn’t su"
re whether I had the 
authority. 
. . .” 
"Beaming, he closed his classroo"
m door in her snarling face. 
Fred and George were heroes that
 night in the Gryffindor common 
room. Even Hermione fought he
r way through the excited crowd 
around them to co
ngratulate them. 
“They were wonderful firewo
"rks,” she said admiringly. "
"“Thanks,” said George, looking both surprised and pleased. "
"“Weasleys’ Wildfire Whiz-Bangs. Only thing is, we used our whole "
"stock, we’re going to have to star"
t again from scra
tch now. . . .” 
"“It was worth it, though,” said Fr"
"ed, who was taking orders from "
clamoring Gryffindors. “If you want to add your name to the waiting 
"list, Hermione, it’s five Galleons for your Basic Blaze box and twenty "
for the Deflagration Deluxe. . . .” 
Hermione returned to the table where Harry and Ron were sitting 
staring at their schoolbags as though hoping their homework might 
spring out of it an
d start doing itself. 
"“Oh, why don’t we have a night off?” said Hermione brightly, as a "
silver-tailed Weasley rocket zoomed 
"past the window. “After all, the "
"Easter holidays start on Friday, we’ll have plenty of time then. . . .” "
"“Are you feeling all right?” Ron asked, staring at her in disbelief. "
"“Now you mention it,” said Herm"
"ione happily, “d’you know . . . I "
think I’m feeling a bit . . . 
rebellious.
” 
Harry could still hear the distant 
bangs
 of escaped firecrackers when 
he and Ron went up to bed an hour
" later, and as he got undressed a "
"sparkler floated past the tower, still resolutely spelling out the word "
POO. 
   635 "He got into bed, yawning. With hi"
"s glasses off, the occasional fire-"
work still passing the wi
"ndow became blurred, "
looking like sparkling 
"clouds, beautiful and mysterious ag"
ainst the black sky. He turned 
"onto his side, wondering how Umbridge was feeling about her first "
"day in Dumbledore’s job, and how Fudge would react when he heard "
that the school had spen
t most of the day in a 
state of advanced dis-
ruption. . . . Smiling to himsel
"f, he closed his eyes. . . . "
The whizzes and bangs of escaped 
fireworks in the grounds seemed 
to be growing more distant . . . 
"or perhaps he, Harry, was simply "
speeding away fr
om them. . . . 
He had fallen right into the corrido
r leading to the Department of 
Mysteries. He was speeding to
ward the plain black door. . . . 
Let it 
open. . . . Let it open. . . .
It did. He was inside the circular
 room lined with doors. . . . He 
"crossed it, placed his hand upon"
" an identical door, and it swung "
inward. . . . 
"Now he was in a long, rectangular "
"room full of an odd, mechanical "
clicking. There were dancing flecks 
of light on the walls but he did 
not pause to investigate. . 
. . He had to go on. . . . 
There was a door at the far end. . . 
. It too opened at his touch. . . . 
And now he was in a dimly lit room
" as high and wide as a church, "
"full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves, each laden "
"with small, dusty, spun-glass sp"
heres. . . . Now Harry’s heart was 
beating fast with excitement. . . . 
He knew where to go. . . . He ran 
"forward, but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous, deserted "
room. . . . 
There was something in 
this room he wanted 
"very, very much. . . . "
Something he wanted. . . . or 
somebody else wanted. . . . 
His scar was hurting. . . . 
BANG! 
"Harry awoke instantly, confused and angry. The dark dor-"
mitory was full of the sound of laughter. 
"“Cool!” said Seamus, who was si"
lhouetted against the window. 
 636 “I think one of those Catherine wheel
s hit a rocket and it’s like they 
"mated, come and see!” "
Harry heard Ron and Dean
 scramble out of bed for a better look. 
He lay quite still and silent while th
e pain in his scar subsided and dis-
appointment washed over him. He 
felt as though a wonderful treat 
had been snatched from 
him at the very last mo
ment. . . . He had got 
so close that time. . . . 
"Glittering, pink-and-silver winged"
 piglets were now soaring past 
the windows of Gryffindor Tower.
 Harry lay and listened to the ap-
preciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them. His 
stomach gave a sickening jolt as he
 remembered that he had Occlu-
mency the followin
g evening. . . . 
Harry spent the whole of the next da
y dreading what Snape was going 
to say if he found out how much fa
rther into the Department of Mys-
teries he had penetrated during his la
st dream. With a surge of guilt he 
realized that he had not practiced Occlumency once since their last 
lesson: There had been too much
 going on since Dumbledore had 
left. He was sure he would not have
 been able to empty his mind even 
"if he had tried. He doubted, ho"
"wever, whether Snape would accept "
that excuse. . . . 
He attempted a little last-minute pr
"actice during classes that day, "
"but it was no good, Hermione ke"
pt asking him what was wrong 
whenever he fell silent trying to
 rid himself of all thought and emo-
"tion and, after all, the best mome"
nt to empty his brain was not while 
teachers were firing review
 questions at the class. 
"Resigned to the worst, he set o"
ff for Snape’s office after dinner. 
"Halfway across the entrance hall, however, Cho came hurrying up to "
him. 
"“Over here,” said Harry, glad of a reason to postpone his meeting "
with Snape and beckoning her across to the corner of the entrance hall 
where the giant hourglasses stood.
 Gryffindor’s was now almost 
   637 empty. “Are you okay? Umbridge hasn’t been asking you about the 
"D.A., has she?” "
"“Oh no,” said Cho hurriedly. “No, it was only . . . Well, I just "
"wanted to say . . . Harry, I never dreamed Marietta would tell. . . .” "
"“Yeah, well,” said Harry moodily. "
He did feel Cho might have cho-
sen her friends a bit more carefully. 
It was small consolation that the 
"last he had heard, Marietta was st"
ill up in the hospital wing and 
Madam Pomfrey had not been able 
to make the slightest improve-
ment to her pimples. 
"“She’s a lovely person really,”"
 s
a
i
d
 C
h
o
.
 “
S
h
e
 j
u
s
t
 m
a
d
e
 a
mistake —” 
Harry looked at her incredulously. 
“
A lovely person who made a mistake
"? She sold us all out, including "
you!” 
"“Well . . . we all got away, didn’t"
 we?” said Cho pleadingly. “You 
"know, her mum works for the Ministry, "
it’s really difficult for her —” 
“Ron’s dad works for the Ministry 
too!” Harry said furiously. “And 
in case you hadn’t no
"ticed, he hasn’t got "
‘sneak’ written across 
his 
face —” 
"“That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger’s,” said Cho "
fiercely. “She should have told 
us she’d jinxed that list —” 
"“I think it was a brilliant idea,”"
 said Harry coldly. Cho flushed and 
her eyes grew brighter. 
"“Oh yes, I forgot — of course, if it was darling "
Hermione’s
 idea —” 
"“Don’t start crying again,"
” said Harry warningly. 
“I wasn’t going to!” she shouted. 
"“Yeah . . . well . . . good,” he said. “I’ve got enough to cope with at "
the moment.” 
"“Go and cope with it then!” she said furiously, turning on her heel "
and stalking off. 
"Fuming, Harry descended the stairs to Snape’s dungeon, and "
though he knew from experience ho
w much easier it would be for 
 638 Snape to penetrate his mind if he 
"arrived angry and resentful, he suc-"
ceeded in nothing but t
hinking of a few more good things he should 
have said to Cho abou
t Marietta before reac
hing the dung
eon door. 
"“You’re late, Potter,” said Snape coldly, as Harry closed the door be-"
hind him. 
Snape was standing with his back 
"to Harry, removing, as usual, cer-"
tain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in Dumbledore’s Pen-
sieve. He dropped the last silver
y strand into th
e stone basin and 
turned to face Harry. 
"“So,” he said. “Have you been practicing?” "
"“Yes,” Harry lied, looking carefull"
y at one of the legs of Snape’s 
desk. 
"“Well, we’ll soon find out, won’"
t we?” said Snape smoothly. “Wand 
"out, Potter.” "
Harry moved into his usual position
", facing Snape with the desk "
between them. His heart was pumpin
g fast with anger at Cho and 
anxiety about how much Snape was 
about to extract from his mind. 
"“On the count of three then,” sa"
id Snape lazily. “One — two —” 
Snape’s office door banged op
en and Draco Ma
lfoy sped in. 
"“Professor Snape, si"
r — oh — sorry —” 
Malfoy was looking at Snape 
and Harry in so
me surprise. 
"“It’s all right, Draco,” said Snape, "
lowering his wand. “Potter is here 
for a little Remedial Potions.” 
Harry had not seen Malfoy look so
 gleeful since Umbridge had 
turned up to 
inspect Hagrid. 
"“I didn’t know,” he said, leerin"
"g at Harry, who knew his face was "
burning. He would have given a grea
t deal to be able to shout the 
"truth at Malfoy — or, even better, to hit him with a good curse. "
"“Well, Draco, what is"
 it?” asked Snape. 
"“It’s Professor Umbridge, sir — she needs your help,” said Malfoy. "
"“They’ve found Montague, sir. He’s "
turned up jammed inside a toilet 
on the fourth floor.” 
   639 “How did he get in th
ere?” demanded Snape. 
"“I don’t know, sir, he’s"
 a bit confused. . . .” 
"“Very well, very well — Potter,” sa"
"id Snape, “we shall resume this "
lesson tomorrow evening instead.” 
He turned and swept from his office. Malfoy mouthed “
Remedial 
Potions
?” at Harry behind Snape’s ba
ck before following him. 
"Seething, Harry replaced his wand "
inside his robes and made to 
leave the room. At least he had twenty-four more hours in which to 
practice; he knew he ought to fe
"el grateful for the narrow escape, "
though it was hard that it came at the expense of Malfoy telling the 
whole school that he needed
 Remedial Potions. . . . 
He was at the office door when he 
saw it: a patch of shivering light 
dancing on the door frame. He sto
"pped, looking at it, reminded of "
something. . . . Then he remembered: It
 was a little like the lights he 
"had seen in his dream last night, th"
e lights in the second room he had 
walked through on his journey thro
ugh the Department of Mysteries. 
He turned around. The light was co
ming from the Pensieve sitting 
on Snape’s desk. The silver-white co
ntents were ebbing and swirling 
within. Snape’s thoughts . . . things 
he did not want Ha
rry to see if he 
broke through Snape’s defe
nses accidentally. . . . 
"Harry gazed at the Pensieve, curiosit"
y welling inside him. . . . What 
was it that Snape was so keen to hide from Harry? 
The silvery lights shivered on the 
wall. . . . Harry took two steps to-
"ward the desk, thinking hard. Coul"
d it possibly be 
information about 
the Department of Mysteries that Sn
ape was determined to keep from 
him? 
"Harry looked over his shoulder, "
his heart now pumping harder and 
faster than ever. How long would it
 take Snape to release Montague 
from the toilet? Would he come straig
"ht back to his office afterward, "
or accompany Montague to the hospital wing? Surely the latter . . . 
Montague was Captain of the Sl
"ytherin Quidditch team, Snape "
would want to make sure 
he was all right. . . . 
 640 Harry walked the remaining few feet
 to the Pensieve and stood over 
"it, gazing into its depths. He hesitated, listening, then pulled out his "
wand again. The office and the corridor beyond were completely 
silent. He gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end 
of his wand. 
The silvery stuff within began to
 swirl very fast. Harry leaned for-
ward over it and saw th
"at it had become transparent. He was, once "
"again, looking down into a room "
as though throug
h a circular win-
"dow in the ceiling. . . . In fact, unless he was much mistaken, he was "
looking down upon the Great Hall. . . . 
His breath was actually fogging the 
surface of Snape’s thoughts. . . . 
His brain seemed to be in limbo. 
. . . It would be insane to do the 
thing that he was so strongly temp
ted to do. . . . He was trembling. 
. . . Snape could be ba
ck at any moment . . . but Harry thought of 
"Cho’s anger, of Malfoy’s jeering face, and a reckless daring seized him. "
He took a great gulp of breath an
d plunged his face into the surface 
"of Snape’s thoughts. At once, the fl"
"oor of the office lurched, tipping "
Harry headfirst into 
the Pensieve. . . . 
He was falling through cold black
"ness, spinning furiously as he "
"went, and then — "
"He was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four "
House tables were gone. Instead 
there were more 
than a hundred 
"smaller tables, all facing the same wa"
"y, at each of which sat a student, "
"head bent low, scribbling on a roll of parchment. The only sound was "
the scratching of quills and the occa
sional rustle as somebody adjusted 
their parchment. It was clearly exam time. 
Sunshine was streaming through th
e high windows onto the bent 
"heads, which shone chestnut and coppe"
r and gold in the bright light. 
Harry looked around carefully. Snap
e had to be here somewhere. . . . 
This was 
his
 memory. . . . 
"And there he was, at a table ri"
ght behind Harry. Harry stared. 
"Snape-the-teenager had a stringy, pall"
"id look about him, like a plant "
   641 kept in the dark. His hair was lank
 and greasy and was flopping onto 
"the table, his hooked nose"
 barely half an inch from the surface of the 
parchment as he scribbled. Harry
 moved around behind Snape and 
read the heading of the examination paper: 
defense against the dark arts — 
ordinary wizarding level 
"So Snape had to be fifteen or sixteen, around Harry’s own age. His "
hand was flying across the parchment
; he had written at least a foot 
"more than his closest neighbors, "
and yet his writing was minuscule 
and cramped. 
“Five more minutes!” 
"The voice made Harry jump; turning, he saw the top of Professor "
Flitwick’s head moving between th
e desks a short distance away. Pro-
fessor Flitwick was walking past a boy 
with untidy black hair . . . very 
untidy black hair. . . . 
"Harry moved so quickly that, had "
"he been solid, he would have "
knocked desks flying. In
"stead he seemed to slide, dreamlike, across "
two aisles and up a third. The back of the black-haired boy’s head 
"drew nearer and nearer. . . . He was straightening up now, putting "
"down his quill, pulling his roll of"
 parchment toward
 him so as to 
reread what he ha
d written. . . . 
Harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteen-
year-old father. 
Excitement exploded in th
e pit of his stomach: 
It was as though he 
was looking at himself but with deli
berate mistakes. James’s eyes were 
"hazel, his nose was slightly longer "
"than Harry’s, and there was no scar "
"on his forehead, but they had the sa"
"me thin face, same mouth, same "
eyebrows. James’s hair stuck up at th
"e back exactly as Harry’s did, his "
"hands could have been Harry’s, and "
Harry could tell that when James 
"stood up, they would be "
within an inch of ea
ch other’s heights. 
"James yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair, making it even "
 642 "messier than it had been. Then, with a glance toward Professor "
"Flitwick, he turned in his seat and "
grinned at a boy si
tting four seats 
behind him. 
With another shock of excitement
", Harry saw Sirius "
give James the 
thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his
" chair at his ease, tilting it back "
on two legs. He was very good-looking;
 his dark hair fell into his eyes 
with a sort of casual elegance nei
ther James’s nor Harry’s could ever 
"have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, "
though he didn’t seem to have noti
ced. And two seats along from this 
girl — Harry’s stomach gave anot
her pleasurable squirm — was Re-
mus Lupin. He looked rather pale 
and peaky (was the full moon ap-
proaching?) and was abso
rbed in the exam: As 
he reread his answers 
he scratched his chin with the end 
"of his quill, frowning slightly. "
So that meant Wormtail had to be
 around here somewhere too . . . 
"and sure enough, Harry spotted him "
"within seconds: a small, mousy-"
haired boy with a pointed nose. Wo
rmtail looked anxious; he was 
"chewing his fingernails, staring down "
"at his paper, scuffing the ground "
with his toes. Every now and then he glanced hopefully at his neigh-
bor’s paper. Harry stared at Worm
"tail for a moment, then back at "
"James, who was now doodling on a "
bit of scrap parchment. He had 
drawn a Snitch and was now tracing 
the letters L. E. What did they 
stand for? 
"“Quills down, please!” squeaked "
Professor Flitwick. “That means 
"you too, Stebbins! Please remain "
seated while I collect your parch-
ment! 
Accio
!” 
More than a hundred rolls of pa
rchment zoomed into the air and 
"into Professor Flitwick’s outstretched arms, knocking him backward "
off his feet. Several people laughed.
 A couple of students at the front 
"desks got up, took hold of Professo"
"r Flitwick beneath the elbows, and "
lifted him onto his feet again. 
"“Thank you . . . thank you,” panted"
" Professor Flitwick. “Very well, "
"everybody, you’re free to go!” "
   643 "Harry looked down at his father, "
who had hastily crossed out the 
"L. E. he had been embellishing, jumped to his feet, stuffed his quill "
and the exam question paper into 
"his bag, which he slung over his "
"back, and stood waiting for "
Sirius to join him. 
"Harry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away, mov-"
ing between the tables toward the 
"doors into the entrance hall, still "
absorbed in his own examination pa
per. Round-shouldered yet angu-
"lar, he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, his oily hair "
swinging about his face. 
A gang of chattering girls separa
"ted Snape from James and Sirius, "
and by planting himself in the mids
"t of this group, Harry managed to "
keep Snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of 
James and his friends. 
"“Did you like question ten, Moon"
y?” asked Sirius as they emerged 
into the entrance hall. 
"“Loved it,” said Lupin briskly. “‘Give five signs that identify the "
werewolf.’ Excellent question.” 
“D’you think you managed to get al
l the signs?” said James in tones 
of mock concern. 
"“Think I did,” said Lupin seriously,"
 as they joined the crowd throng-
ing around the front doors eager to 
get out into the sunlit grounds. 
“One: He’s sitting on my chair. Two:
 He’s wearing my clothes. Three: 
His name’s Remus Lupin . . .” 
Wormtail was the only 
one who didn’t laugh. 
"“I got the snout shape, the pupils "
"of the eyes, and the tufted tail,” "
"he said anxiously, “but I co"
uldn’t think what else —” 
"“How thick are you, Wormtail?” said James impatiently. “You run "
round with a werewolf once a month —” 
"“Keep your voice down,"
” implored Lupin. 
Harry looked anxiously behind hi
m again. Snape remained close 
"by, still buried in his examinatio"
n questions; but this was Snape’s 
"memory, and Harry was sure that if "
Snape chose to wander off in a 
 644 different direction once outside in 
"the grounds, he, Harry, would not "
be able to follow James any farther.
" To his intense relief, however, "
when James and his three friends strode off down the lawn toward the 
"lake, Snape followed, still poring over the paper and apparently with "
no fixed idea of where he was going.
" By jogging a little ahead of him, "
Harry managed to maintain a close 
watch on James and the others. 
"“Well, I thought that paper was a piece of cake,” he heard Sirius say. "
“I’ll be surprised if I don’t ge
t Outstanding on 
it at least.” 
"“Me too,” said James. He put his "
hand in his pock
et and took out 
a struggling Golden Snitch. 
“Where’d you get that?” 
"“Nicked it,” said James casually. He started playing with the Snitch, "
allowing it to fly as mu
ch as a foot away and seizing it again; his re-
flexes were excellent. Worm
tail watched him in awe. 
They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge 
"of the lake where Harry, Ron, "
and Hermione had spent a Sunday fin-
"ishing their homework, and threw "
themselves down on the grass. 
Harry looked over his shoulder yet 
"again and saw, to his delight, "
that Snape had settled himself on th
e grass in the dense shadows of a 
clump of bushes. He was as deeply immersed in the O.W.L. paper as 
"ever, which left Harry free to sit dow"
n on the grass between the beech 
and the bushes and 
watch the foursome
 under the tree. 
The sunlight was dazzli
ng on the smooth surfac
"e of the lake, on the "
bank of which the group of laughing
 girls who had just left the Great 
Hall were sitting with shoes and so
"cks off, cooling their feet in the "
water. 
Lupin had pulled out a book and was 
reading. Sirius stared around 
at the students milling over the gr
"ass, looking rather haughty and "
"bored, but very handsomely so. James was still playing with the "
"Snitch, letting it zoom "
farther and farther away
", almost escaping but "
always grabbed at the last second
. Wormtail was watching him with 
his mouth open. Every time James made
" a particularly difficult catch, "
   645 Wormtail gasped and applauded. Af
"ter five minutes of this, Harry "
wondered why James didn’t tell Wormta
"il to get a grip on himself, but "
James seemed to be enjoying the at
tention. Harry noticed his father 
had a habit of rumpling up
 his hair as though to make sure it did not 
"get too tidy, and also that he kept "
looking over at the girls by the wa-
ter’s edge. 
"“Put that away, will you?"
"” said Sirius finally, "
as James made a fine 
catch and Wormtail let out a cheer
. “Before Wormtail wets himself 
from excitement.” 
Wormtail turned slightly 
pink but James grinned. 
"“If it bothers you,” he said, stuffi"
ng the Snitch back in his pocket. 
Harry had the distinct impression th
at Sirius was the only one for 
whom James would have 
stopped showing off. 
"“I’m bored,” said Sirius. “Wish it was full moon.” "
"“You might,” said Lupin darkly fr"
om behind his book. “We’ve still 
"got Transfiguration, if you’re bored "
you could test me. . . . Here.” He 
held out his book. 
Sirius snorted. “I don’t 
"need to look at that rubbish, I know it all.” "
"“This’ll liven you up, "
"Padfoot,” said James qu"
ietly. “Look who it 
is. . . .” 
"Sirius’s head turned. He had become very still, like a dog that has "
scented a rabbit. 
"“Excellent,” he said softly. “"
Snivellus.
” 
Harry turned to see what
 Sirius was looking at. 
"Snape was on his feet again, and "
was stowing the O.W.L. paper in 
his bag. As he emerged from the 
shadows of the bushes and set off 
"across the grass, Sirius and Jame"
s stood up. Lupin and Wormtail re-
mained sitting: Lupin was still st
"aring down at his book, though his "
eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his 
eyebrows. Wormtail was looking from
 Sirius and James to Snape with 
a look of avid anticipation on his face. 
"“All right, Snivellus?"
” said James loudly. 
 646 Snape reacted so fast it was as th
ough he had been expecting an at-
"tack: Dropping his bag, he plunged "
"his hand inside his robes, and his "
wand was halfway into the 
"air when James shouted, “"
Expelliarmus
!” 
Snape’s wand flew twelve feet into 
the air and fell with a little thud 
in the grass behind him. Sirius
 let out a bark of laughter. 
“
Impedimenta
"!” he said, pointing his wand at Snape, who was "
"knocked off his feet, halfway throug"
h a dive toward his own fallen 
wand. 
Students all around had turned to watch. Some of them had gotten 
to their feet and were edging near
er to watch. Some looked apprehen-
"sive, others entertained. "
Snape lay panting on the ground. 
James and Sirius advanced on 
"him, wands up, James glancing over his"
 shoulder at the girls at the wa-
ter’s edge as he went. Wormtail 
"was on his feet now, watching hun-"
"grily, edging around Lupin to get a clearer view. "
"“How’d the exam go, Sn"
ivelly?” said James. 
"“I was watching him, his nose wa"
"s touching the parchment,” said "
"Sirius viciously. “There’ll be great grease marks all over it, they won’t "
be able to read a word.” 
Several people watching laughed; Snape was clearly unpopular. 
"Wormtail sniggered shrilly. Snape was trying to get up, but the jinx "
was still operating on him; he was st
"ruggling, as though bound by in-"
visible ropes. 
"“You — wait,” he panted, staring up"
 at James with an expression of 
purest loathing. “Y
ou — wait. . . .” 
“Wait for what?” said Sirius coolly
". “What’re you going to do, Sniv-"
"elly, wipe your "
nose on us?” 
"Snape let out a stream of mixed swearwords and hexes, but his "
wand being ten feet away nothing happened. 
"“Wash out your mouth,” said James coldly. “"
Scourgify
!” 
Pink soap bubbles streamed from Snape’s mouth at once; the froth 
"was covering his lips, maki"
"ng him gag, choking him — "
   647 “Leave him ALONE!” 
James and Sirius looked around. 
James’s free hand jumped to his 
hair again. 
It was one of the girls from the la
"ke edge. She had thick, dark red "
hair that fell to her shoulders an
d startlingly green almond-shaped 
eyes — Harry’s eyes. 
Harry’s mother . . . 
"“All right, Evans?” said James, and the tone of his voice was sud-"
"denly pleasant, deeper, more mature. "
"“Leave him alone,” Lily repeated"
. She was looking at James with 
every sign of great dislike.
 “What’s he done to you?” 
"“Well,” said James, appearing to de"
"liberate the point, “it’s more the "
fact that he 
"exists,"
 if you know what
 I mean. . . .” 
Many of the surrounding watchers
" laughed, Sirius and Wormtail "
"included, but Lupin, still apparently"
 intent on his 
"book, didn’t, and "
neither did Lily. 
"“You think you’re funny,” she said "
coldly. “But you’re just an arro-
"gant, bullying toerag, Potter. Leave him "
alone.
” 
“I will if you go ou
"t with me, Evans,” said"
 James quickly. “Go on 
". . . Go out with me, an"
d I’ll never lay a wand 
on old Snivelly again.” 
"Behind him, the Impediment Jinx "
was wearing off. Snape was be-
ginning to inch toward his fallen 
"wand, spitting out soapsuds as he "
crawled. 
“I wouldn’t go out with you if it was a choice between you and the 
"giant squid,” said Lily. "
"“Bad luck, Prongs,” said Sirius bris"
"kly, turning back to Snape. “OY!” "
But too late; Snape had directed his
 wand straight at James; there 
was a flash of light and a gash appe
"ared on the side of James’s face, "
spattering his robes with blood. Jame
s whirled about; a second flash of 
"light later, Snape was hanging upside"
" down in the air, "
his robes falling 
"over his head to reveal skinny, pa"
llid legs and a pair of graying 
underpants. 
 648 Many people in the small crowd 
"watching cheered. Sirius, James, "
and Wormtail roared with laughter. 
"Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as "
though she was going to sm
"ile, said, “Let him down!” "
"“Certainly,” said James and he je"
rked his wand upward. Snape fell 
into a crumpled heap on the grou
nd. Disentangling himself from his 
"robes, he got quickly to his fe"
"et, wand up, but Sirius said, “"
Petrificus 
Totalus
!” and Snape keeled over agai
"n at once, rigid as a board. "
“LEAVE HIM ALONE!” Lily shouted. She had her own wand out 
now. James and Sirius eyed it warily. 
"“Ah, Evans, don’t make me he"
"x you,” said James earnestly. "
"“Take the curse off him, then!” "
"James sighed deeply, then turned to Snape and muttered the "
countercurse. 
"“There you go,” he said, as Snape "
"struggled to his feet again, “you’re "
"lucky Evans was here, Snivellus —” "
“I don’t need help from filthy
 little Mudbl
oods like her!” 
"Lily blinked. “Fine,” she said cool"
ly. “I won’t bother in future. And 
"I’d wash your pants if I were you, "
Snivellus.
” 
“Apologize to Evans!” James roar
"ed at Snape, his wand pointed "
threateningly at him. 
“I don’t want 
you
" to make him apologize,” "
"Lily shouted, rounding "
on James. “You’re as 
bad as he is. . . .” 
“What?” yelped James. “I’d NEVER call you a — you-know-what!” 
“Messing up your hair because you 
think it looks cool
 to look like 
you’ve just got off your broomstic
"k, showing off with that stupid "
"Snitch, walking down corridors and "
hexing anyone who annoys you 
just because you can — I’m surprise
d your broomstick can get off the 
ground with that fat head on it. You make me SICK.” 
She turned on her heel and hurried away. 
“Evans!” James shouted af
"ter her, “Hey, EVANS!” "
But she didn’t look back. 
   649 "“What is it with her?” said James, trying and failing to look as "
though this was a throwaway question
 of no real importance to him. 
"“Reading between the lines, I’d say sh"
"e thinks you’re a bit conceited, "
"mate,” said Sirius. "
"“Right,” said James,"
 who looked furiou
"s now, “right —” "
"There was another flash of light,"
 and Snape was once again hang-
ing upside down in the air. 
“Who wants to see me take
 off Snivelly’s pants?” 
But whether James really did take
" off Snape’s pants, Harry never "
"found out. A hand had closed tight over his upper arm, closed with a "
"pincerlike grip. Wincing, Harry look"
ed around to see who had hold of 
"him, and saw, with a thrill of horr"
"or, a fully grown, adult-sized Snape "
standing right beside 
"him, white with rage. "
“Having fun?” 
Harry felt himself rising into the air. The summer’s day evaporated 
"around him, he was floating upward through icy blackness, Snape’s "
hand still tight upon his upper arm.
" Then, with a swooping feeling as "
though he had turned head over h
"eels in midair, his feet hit the stone "
"floor of Snape’s dungeon, and he "
was standing again beside the Pen-
"sieve on Snape’s desk in the shadowy, present-day Potions master’s "
study. 
"“So,” said Snape, gripping Harry’"
s arm so tightly Harry’s hand was 
starting to feel numb. “
So
 . . . been enjoying
" yourself, Potter?” "
"“N-no . . .” said Harry, trying to free his arm. "
It was scary: Snape’s lips were shak
"ing, his face was white, his teeth "
were bared. 
"“Amusing man, your father, wasn’t"
" he?” said Snape, shaking Harry "
so hard that his glasse
s slipped down his nose. 
“I — didn’t —” 
Snape threw Harry from him with 
all his might. Harry fell hard 
onto the dungeon floor. 
“You will not tell 
anybody what you saw!” Snape bellowed. 
 650 "“No,” said Harry, getting to his feet"
 as far from Snape as he could. 
"“No, of course I w —” "
"“Get out, get out, I don’t want to "
see you in this office ever again!” 
And as Harry hurtled toward the 
"door, a jar of dead cockroaches "
exploded over his head. He wrenched the door open and flew away up 
"the corridor, stopping only when "
he had put three floors between 
himself and Snape. There he leaned
" against the wall, panting, and "
rubbing his bruised arm. 
He had no desire at all to return 
"to Gryffindor Tower so early, nor "
to tell Ron and Hermione what he 
had just seen. What was making 
Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or hav-
ing jars thrown at him — it was that
 he knew how it felt to be humil-
iated in the middle of a circle of 
"onlookers, knew exactly how Snape "
had felt as his father had taunted him
", and that judging from what he "
"had just seen, his father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had al-"
ways told him. 
But why haven’t you got Occlumen
cy lessons anymore?” said Her-
"mione, frowning. "
“I’ve 
told
" you,” Harry muttered. “Snape"
 reckons I can carry on by 
myself now I’ve got 
the basics. . . .” 
“So you’ve stopped having funny 
dreams?” said Hermione skepti-
cally. 
"“Pretty much,” said Har"
"ry, not looking at her. "
"“Well, I don’t think Snape should stop until you’re absolutely sure "
you can control them!” said Herm
"ione indignantly. “Harry, I think "
you should go back to him and ask —” 
"“No,” said Harry forcefully. “J"
"ust drop it, He"
"rmione, okay?” "
It was the first day of the Easter 
"holidays and Hermione, as was her "
"custom, had spent a large part of "
the day drawing up study schedules 
for the three of them. Harry and Ron 
had let her do it — it was easier 
"than arguing with her and, in any "
"case, they might "
come in useful. 
Ron had been startled to discover th
at there were only six weeks left 
until their exams. 
B 
 652 “How can that come as a shoc
"k?” Hermione demanded, as she "
tapped each little square on Ron’s schedule with her wand so that it 
flashed a different color ac
cording to its subject. 
"“I dunno . . .” said Ron, “there"
’s been a lot going on. . . .” 
"“Well, there you are,” she said, "
"handing him his schedule, “if you "
follow that you should do fine.” 
Ron looked down it gloomil
"y, but then brightened. "
“You’ve given me an ev
ening off every week!” 
“That’s for Quidditch prac
"tice,” said Hermione. "
The smile faded from Ron’s face. 
“What’s the point?” he said. “We’ve got about as much chance of 
winning the Quidditch Cup this year
 as Dad’s got of becoming Min-
ister of Magic. . . .” 
Hermione said nothing. She was 
"looking at Harry, who was staring "
blankly at the opposite wall of 
the common room while Crookshanks 
"pawed at his hand, trying to"
 get his ears scratched. 
"“What’s wrong, Harry?” "
“What?” he said quic
kly. “Nothing . . .” 
He seized his copy of 
Defensive Magical Theory
 and pretended to be 
looking something up in the index. Crookshanks gave him up as a bad 
job and slunk away under Hermione’s chair. 
"“I saw Cho earlier,” said Hermione"
" tentatively, “and she looked re-"
ally miserable too. . . . Ha
ve you two had a row again?” 
"“Wha — oh yeah, we have,” said"
" Harry, seizing gratefully on the "
excuse. 
“What about?” 
“That sneak friend of hers
", Marietta,” said Harry. "
"“Yeah, well, I don’t blame you!” sa"
"id Ron angrily, setting down his "
study schedule. “If it hadn
’t been for her . . .” 
Ron went into a rant about Ma
"rietta Edgecombe, which Harry "
"found helpful. All he had to do was look angry, nod, and say “yeah” "
  653  and “that’s right” whenever Ron drew
" breath, leaving his mind free to "
"dwell, ever more miserably, on what he had seen in the Pensieve. "
He felt as though th
e memory of it was eati
ng him from inside. 
He had been so sure that his par
ents had been wonderful people that 
he never had the slightest difficulty 
in disbelieving Snape’s aspersions 
on his father’s character. Hadn’t
 people like Hagrid and Sirius 
told
Harry how wonderful his father had been? (
"Yeah, well, look what "
"Sirius was like himself,"
 said a nagging voice in
side Harry’s head. . . . 
"He was as bad, wasn’t he"
"?) Yes, he had once overheard Professor "
McGonagall saying that his father 
and Sirius had been troublemak-
"ers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the "
"Weasley twins, and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dan-"
gling someone upside down 
for the fun of it . . 
. not unless they re-
ally loathed them . . . Perhaps 
"Malfoy, or somebody who really "
deserved it . . . 
Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had 
"suffered at James’s hands — but hadn’t Lily asked, “What’s he done to "
"you?” And hadn’t James replied, "
“It’s more the fact that he 
"exists,"
 if you 
know what I mean?” Hadn
’t James started it all 
simply because Sirius 
said he was bored? Harry remember
ed Lupin saying back in Grim-
mauld Place that Dumbledore had ma
de him prefect in the hope that 
he would be able to exercise some 
control over James and Sirius. . . . 
"But in the Pensieve, he"
 had sat there and let 
it all happen. . . . 
Harry reminded himself that Lily 
had intervened; his mother had 
"been decent, yet the memory of the "
look on her face as she had 
shouted at James disturbed him quit
e as much as anything else. She 
had clearly loathed James and Ha
rry simply could not understand 
how they could have ended up marri
ed. Once or twice he even won-
dered whether James had fo
rced her into it. . . . 
For nearly five years the thought of
 his father had been a source of 
"comfort, of inspiration. Whenever "
someone had told him he was like  
 654 James he had glowed with pride insi
de. And now . . . now he felt cold 
and miserable at th
e thought of him. 
"The weather grew breezier, brighter, and warmer as the holidays "
"passed, but Harry was stuck with th"
e rest of the fifth and seventh 
"years, who were all trapped inside, traipsing back and forth to the li-"
brary. Harry pretended that his ba
d mood had no other cause but the 
"approaching exams, and as his fello"
w Gryffindors were sick of study-
"ing themselves, his excuse went unchallenged. "
"“Harry, I’m talking to yo"
"u, can you hear me?” "
“Huh?” 
He looked around. Ginny Weasle
"y, looking very windswept, had "
joined him at the librar
y table where he had been 
sitting alone. It was 
late on Sunday evening; Hermio
ne had gone back to Gryffindor 
Tower to review Ancient Runes; Ron had Quidditch practice. 
"“Oh hi,” said Harry, pulling his books back toward him. “How "
come you’re not 
at practice?” 
"“It’s over,” said Ginny. “Ron had to"
 take Jack Sloper up to the hos-
pital wing.” 
“Why?” 
"“Well, we’re not sure, but we "
think
 he knocked himself out with his 
own bat.” She sighed heavily. “Anyway 
". . . a package just arrived, it’s "
only just got through Umbridge’s new screening process. . . .” 
She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper onto the table; it had 
"clearly been unwrapped and carelessly rewrapped, and there was a "
"scribbled note across it in red ink, reading "
inspected and passed by 
the hogwarts high inquisitor
. 
"“It’s Easter eggs from Mum,” said "
Ginny. “There’s one for you. . . . 
There you go. . . .” 
She handed him a handsome chocol
"ate egg decorated with small, "
"iced Snitches and, according to th"
"e packaging, containing a bag of "
Fizzing Whizbees. Harry looked at 
"it for a moment, then, to his hor-"
"ror, felt a hard lump rise in his throat. "
  655 "“Are you okay, Harry?” asked Ginny quietly. "
"“Yeah, I’m fine,” said Harry gruffl"
y. The lump in his throat was 
painful. He did not understand why 
an Easter egg should have made 
him feel like this. 
"“You seem really down lately,” "
"Ginny persisted. “You know, I’m "
sure if you just 
talked
 to Cho . . .” 
"“It’s not Cho I want to talk to,” said Harry brusquely. "
"“Who is it, then?” asked Ginny. "
“I . . .” 
He glanced around to make quite 
sure that nobody was listening; 
Madam Pince was several shelves away
", stamping out a pile of books "
for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott. 
"“I wish I could talk to Sirius,” he"
 muttered. “But I know I can’t.” 
More to give himself something to do than because he really 
"wanted any, Harry unwrapped his Ea"
"ster egg, broke off a large bit, "
and put it into his mouth. 
"“Well,” said Ginny slowly, helping "
"herself to a bit of egg too, “if "
"you really want to talk to Sirius, "
I expect we could think of a way to 
do it. . . .” 
"“Come on,” said Harry hopelessly. “With Umbridge policing the "
fires and reading all our mail?” 
“The thing about growing up with
" Fred and George,” said Ginny "
"thoughtfully, “is that you sort of st"
art thinking anything’s possible if 
you’ve got enough nerve.” 
Harry looked at her. Perhaps it 
was the effect of the chocolate — 
Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with demen-
tors — or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had 
"been burning inside him for a week, bu"
t he felt a bit more hopeful. . . . 
“WHAT DO YOU THIN
K YOU ARE DOING?” 
"“Oh damn,” whispered Ginny, jump"
ing to her feet. “I forgot —” 
"Madam Pince was swooping down upon them, her shriveled face "
contorted with rage. 
 656 “
Chocolate in the library
!” she screamed. “Out — 
out
 — OUT!” 
"And whipping out her wand, she ca"
"used Harry’s books, bag, and "
"ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library, whacking them "
repeatedly over the head as they ran. 
As though to underline the importance of their upcoming examina-
"tions, a batch of pamphlets, leaflets, and notices concerning various "
Wizarding careers appeared on the ta
bles in Gryffindor Tower shortly 
"before the end of the holidays, along with yet another notice on the "
"board, which read: "
CAREER ADVICE 
All fifth years will be required
 to attend a short meeting 
with their Head of House duri
ng the first week of the Sum-
"mer term, in which they will be given the opportunity to "
discuss their future careers. Times of individual appoint-
ments are listed below. 
Harry looked down the list and foun
d that he was expected in Pro-
"fessor McGonagall’s office at half-past two on Monday, which would "
mean missing most of Divination. 
He and the other fifth years spent 
a considerable part of the final week
end of the Easter break reading all 
the career information that had be
en left there for their perusal. 
"“Well, I don’t fancy Healing,” said Ron on the last evening of the "
holidays. He was immersed in a le
aflet that carried the crossed bone-
and-wand emblem of St. Mungo’s on its front. “It says here you need 
"at least an E at N.E.W.T. level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration, "
"Charms, and Defense Against the Dark "
Arts. I mean . . . blimey. . . . 
"Don’t want much, do they?” "
"“Well, it’s a very responsible job, "
isn’t it?” said Hermione absently. 
She was poring over a bright pink-a
nd-orange leaflet that was headed 
so you think you’d like to work in muggle relations
? “You don’t 
  657 seem to need many qualifications to 
liaise with Muggles. . . . All they 
want is an O.W.L. in Muggle Studies. . . 
.
 ‘
Much more important is your 
"enthusiasm, patience, and a good sense of fun"
!’” 
"“You’d need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,” "
said Harry darkly. “Good sense of wh
"en to duck, more like . . .” He "
was halfway through a pamphlet on 
Wizard banking. “Listen to this: 
“‘
"Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure, and "
"substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a position "
"with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, wh"
o are currently recruiting Curse-
Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad.
 . . .’
"They want Arithmancy, "
though. . . . You coul
"d do it, Hermione!” "
"“I don’t much fancy banking,” said Hermione vaguely, now im-"
mersed in 
have you got what it take
s to train security trolls
? 
"“Hey,” said a voice in Harry’s ear. He looked around; Fred and "
George had come to join them. “Ginny’s had a word with us about 
"you,” said Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them "
and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to 
slide off onto the floor. “She says
 you need to talk to Sirius?” 
"“What?” said Hermione sharply, "
freezing with her hand halfway 
toward picking up 
make a bang at the department of magical 
accidents and catastrophes. 
"“Yeah . . .” said Harry, "
trying to sound casual
", “yeah, I thought I’d "
like —” 
“Don’t be so ridiculo
"us,” said Hermione, straightening up and "
looking at him as though she coul
d not believe her eyes. “With Um-
bridge groping around in the fi
res and frisking all the owls?” 
"“Well, we think we can find a "
"way around that,” said George, "
stretching and smiling. 
“It’s a simple matter of causing a diversion. 
"Now, you might have noticed that "
we have been rather quiet on the 
mayhem front during th
e Easter holidays?” 
"“What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure "
time?” continued Fred. “No point at 
"all, we answered ourselves. And "
 658 "of course, we’d have messed up peop"
"le’s studying too, which would be "
the very last thing 
we’d want to do.” 
He gave Hermione a sanctimonious 
little nod. She looked rather 
taken aback by this
 thoughtfulness. 
“But it’s business as usual from 
"tomorrow,” Fred continued briskly. "
"“And if we’re going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that "
Harry can have his ch
at with Sirius?” 
"“Yes, but "
"still,"
” said Hermione with an air of explaining something 
"very simple to somebody very obtuse, “even if you "
do
 cause a diver-
"sion, how is Harry suppos"
ed to talk to him?” 
"“Umbridge’s office,” "
said Harry quietly. 
He had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could think of no 
alternative; Umbridge herself had told
 him that the only fire that was 
not being watched was her own. 
“Are — you — insane?” said He
rmione in a hushed voice. 
Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the cultivated fungus trade 
and was watching the 
conversation warily. 
"“I don’t think so,” sa"
"id Harry, shrugging. "
“And how are you going to get 
in there in the first place?” 
Harry was ready for this question. 
"“Sirius’s knife,” he said. "
“Excuse me?” 
“Christmas before last Sirius gave 
"me a knife that’ll open any lock,” "
said Harry. “So even if she’s bewitched the door so 
Alohomora
 won’t 
"work, which I bet she has —” "
“What do you think about this?” He
"rmione demanded of Ron, and "
Harry was reminded irresistibly of 
Mrs. Weasley appe
aling to her hus-
band during Harry’s first di
nner in Grimmauld Place. 
"“I dunno,” said Ron, looking alar"
med at being asked to give an 
opinion. “If Harry wants to do it
", it’s up to him, isn’t it?” "
“Spoken like a true friend and We
"asley,” said Fred, clapping Ron "
"hard on the back. “Right, then. We’re thinking of doing it tomorrow, "
  659 "just after lessons, because it shou"
ld cause maximum impact if every-
"body’s in the corridors — Harry, we’ll "
set it off in the east wing some-
"where, draw her right away from"
 her own office — I reckon we 
"should be able to guarantee you,"
" what, twenty minutes?” he said, "
looking at George. 
"“Easy,” said George. "
“What sort of diversio
n is it?” asked Ron. 
"“You’ll see, little bro,” said Fred"
", as he and George got up again. "
"“At least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy’s corridor "
round about five o’
clock tomorrow.” 
"Harry awoke very early the next day, "
feeling almost as anxious as he 
had done on the morning of his hear
ing at the Ministry of Magic. It 
was not only the prospect of breaki
ng into Umbridge’s office and us-
ing her fire to speak to Sirius th
"at was making him feel nervous, "
though that was certainly bad eno
ugh — today also happened to be 
the first time he would be in clos
e proximity with Snape since Snape 
had thrown him out of 
"his office, as they ha"
d Potions that day. 
After lying in bed for a while thin
"king about the day ahead, Harry "
got up very quietly and moved acro
ss to the window beside Neville’s 
"bed, staring out on a truly glorio"
"us morning. The sky was a clear, "
"misty, opalescent blue. Directly "
"ahead of him, Harry could see the "
towering beech tree below which 
his father had once tormented 
Snape. He was not sure what Siri
us could possibly say to him that 
"would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was des-"
"perate to hear Sirius’s own account of what had happened, to know of "
any mitigating factors there might ha
"ve been, any excuse at all for his "
father’s behavior. . . . 
Something caught Harry’s attention:
 movement on the edge of the 
Forbidden Forest. Harry squinted 
into the sun and saw Hagrid 
emerging from between the trees. He 
seemed to be limping. As Harry 
"watched, Hagrid staggered to the "
door of his cabin and disappeared 
 660 inside it. Harry watched the cabin fo
r several minutes. Hagrid did not 
"emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could "
not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire. . . . 
"Harry turned away from the window, "
"headed back to his trunk, and "
started to dress. 
With the prospect of forcing entry
" into Umbridge’s office ahead, "
Harry had never expected the day to 
"be a restful one, but he had not "
reckoned on Hermione’s almost co
ntinual attempts to dissuade him 
from what he was planning to do at 
"five o’clock. For the first time ever, "
she was at least as inattentive to 
Professor Binns in History of Magic 
"as Harry and Ron were, keeping up "
a stream of whispered admoni-
tions that Harry tried 
very hard to ignore. 
“. . . and if she does catch you ther
"e, apart from being expelled, she’ll "
be able to guess you’ve been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect 
she’ll 
force
 you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions. . . .” 
"“Hermione,” said Ron in a low and indignant voice, “are you going "
to stop telling Harry off and listen to
" Binns, or am I going to have to "
take notes instead?” 
"“You take notes for a change, it won’t kill you!” "
By the time they reached the du
"ngeons, neither Harry nor Ron was "
speaking to Hermione any longer. Un
"deterred, she took advantage of "
"their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings, all "
uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to 
waste five whole minutes checki
ng his cauldron for leaks. 
"Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry "
"were invisible. Harry was, of course, we"
"ll used to this tactic, as it was "
"one of Uncle Vernon’s favorites, an"
d on the whole was grateful he had 
"to suffer nothing worse. In fact, co"
mpared to what he usually had to 
endure from Snape in the way of ta
"unts and snide remarks, he found "
the new approach something of an
 improvement and was pleased to 
"find that when left well alone, he "
was able to concoct an Invigoration 
Draught quite easily. At the end of 
the lesson he scooped some of the 
  661 "potion into a flask, corked it, and t"
ook it up to Snape’s desk for mark-
"ing, feeling that he might at last have scraped an E. "
He had just turned away when he
 heard a smashing noise; Malfoy 
gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Ha
rry whipped around again. His po-
tion sample lay in pieces on th
"e floor, and Snape was watching him "
with a look of gloating pleasure. 
"“Whoops,” he said softly. “Ano"
"ther zero, then, Potter . . .” "
Harry was too incensed to speak. He
" strode back to his cauldron, "
intending to fill another 
flask and force Snape to
" mark it, but saw to "
his horror that the rest of
 the contents had vanished. 
“I’m sorry!” said Hermione with her hands over her mouth. “I’m 
"really sorry, Harry, I thought yo"
"u’d finished, so I cleared up!” "
Harry could not bring himself to 
answer. When the bell rang he 
hurried out of the dungeon without 
a backward glance and made sure 
that he found himself a seat betwe
en Neville and Seamus for lunch so 
that Hermione could not start naggi
ng him about using Umbridge’s 
office again. 
He was in such a bad mood by the 
time that he got to Divination 
that he had quite forgotten his ca
reer appointment with Professor 
"McGonagall, remembering only when Ron asked him why he wasn’t "
"in her office. He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only "
a few minutes late. 
"“Sorry, Professo"
"r,” he panted, as he closed"
 the door. “I forgot. . . .” 
"“No matter, Potter,” she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody "
else sniffed from the corner. Harry looked around. 
Professor Umbridge was sitting th
"ere, a clipboard on her knee, a "
fussy little pie-frill around her ne
"ck, and a small, horribly smug smile "
on her face. 
"“Sit down, Potter,” said Professo"
r McGonagall tersely. Her hands 
shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk. 
Harry sat down with his back to 
Umbridge and did 
his best to pre-
tend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard. 
 662 "“Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might "
"have, and to help you decide which "
subjects you should continue into 
"sixth and seventh years,” said Pr"
ofessor McGonagall. “Have you had 
any thoughts about what you wo
uld like to do after you leave 
Hogwarts?” 
"“Er,” said Harry. "
He was finding the scratching noise from behind him very dis-
tracting. 
“Yes?” Professor McGonagall prompted Harry. 
"“Well, I thought of, maybe, be"
"ing an Auror,” "
Harry mumbled. 
"“You’d need top grades for that,” said Professor McGonagall, ex-"
"tracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and "
opening it. “They ask for a minimum 
"of five N.E.W.T.s, and nothing "
"under ‘Exceeds Expectations’ grade,"
 I see. Then you would be re-
quired to undergo a stringent series 
of character and aptitude tests at 
"the Auror office. It’s a difficult career path, Potter; they only take the "
"best. In fact, I don’t think anybody has been taken on in the last three "
years.” 
At this moment Professor Umbrid
"ge gave a very tiny cough, as "
though she was trying to see how 
quietly she could do it. Professor 
McGonagall ignored her. 
“You’ll want to know which subjec
"ts you ought to take, I suppose?” "
"she went on, talking a little"
 more loudly than before. 
"“Yes,” said Harry. “D"
efense Against the Da
"rk Arts, I suppose?” "
"“Naturally,” said Professor McGo"
nagall crisply. “I would also 
advise —” 
Professor Umbridge gave another co
"ugh, a little more audible this "
time. Professor McGonagall closed
" her eyes for a moment, opened "
"them again, and continued as "
though nothing 
had happened. 
"“I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently "
need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell 
"you now, Potter, that I do not a"
ccept students into my N.E.W.T. 
  663 classes unless they have achieved ‘Exceeds Expectations’ or higher at 
Ordinary Wizarding Level. I’d say you’
re averaging ‘Acceptable’ at the 
"moment, so you’ll need to put in some good hard work before the ex-"
"ams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, "
"always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,” she added, with the "
merest flicker of a smile. “Poisons and antidotes are essential study for 
Aurors. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to 
take students who get anything othe
r than ‘Outstanding’ in their 
"O.W.L.s, so —” "
Professor Umbridge gave her 
most pronounced cough yet. 
"“May I offer you a cough drop, "
Dolores?” Professor McGonagall 
"asked curtly, with"
out looking at Pr
ofessor Umbridge. 
"“Oh no, thank you very much,” said Umbridge, with that simper-"
ing laugh Harry hated so much. “I 
just wondered whether I could 
make the teensiest in
"terruption, Minerva?” "
"“I daresay you’ll find you can,” "
said Professor McGonagall through 
tightly gritted teeth. 
“I was just wondering whether Mr. Potter has 
quite
 the tempera-
ment for an Auror?” said Pr
ofessor Umbridge sweetly. 
“Were you?” said Professor McGona
"gall haughtily. “Well, Potter,” "
"she continued, as though there had "
"been no interruption, “if you are "
"serious in this ambition, I would ad"
vise you to concentrate hard on 
bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Profes-
sor Flitwick has graded you betw
een Acceptable’ and ‘Exceeds Expec-
"tations’ for the last two years, so "
your Charm work seems satisfactory; 
as for Defense Against the Dark Arts
", your marks have been generally "
"high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you — "
are you quite sure 
"you wouldn’t like a cough drop, Dolores"
?” 
"“Oh, no need, thank you, Mine"
"rva,” simpered Professor Um-"
"bridge, who had just coughed her loudest yet. “I was just concerned "
that you might not have Harry’s 
most recent Defense Against the 
Dark Arts marks in front of you. I’m quite sure I slipped in a note . . .” 
 664 "“What, this thing?” said Professo"
r McGonagall in a tone of revul-
"sion, as she pulled a sheet of pink "
parchment from be
tween the leaves 
"of Harry’s folder. She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised, "
then placed it ba
ck into the folder
 without comment. 
"“Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a "
pronounced aptitude for the subjec
"t, and obviously for an Auror —” "
“Did you not understand my note
", Minerva?” asked Professor Um-"
"bridge in honeyed tones, qu"
ite forgetting to cough. 
"“Of course I understood it,” said"
" Professor McGonagall, her teeth "
clenched so tightly that the 
words came out a little muffled. 
"“Well, then, I am confused. . . . I’"
m afraid I don’t quite understand 
how you can give Mr. Potte
r false hope that —” 
“False hope?” repeated Professor Mc
"Gonagall, still refusing to look "
round at Professor Umbridge. “He ha
s achieved high marks in all his 
Defense Against the Dark Arts tests —” 
“I’m terribly sorry to have to cont
"radict you, Minerva, but as you "
"will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in "
his classes with me —” 
“I should have made my meanin
"g plainer,” said Professor McGo-"
"nagall, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes. “He has "
achieved high marks in all Defense Ag
ainst the Dark Ar
ts tests set by 
a competent teacher.” 
Professor Umbridge’s smile vanish
ed as suddenly as a lightbulb 
"blowing. She sat back in her chair,"
" turned a sheet on her clipboard, "
and began scribbling very fast indeed
", her bulging eyes rolling from "
side to side. Professor McGonagall 
"turned back to Harry, her thin "
"nostrils flared, her eyes burning. "
"“Any questions, Potter?” "
"“Yes,” said Harry. “What sort of "
character and aptitude tests do the 
"Ministry do on you, if "
you get enough N.E.W.T.s?” 
"“Well, you’ll need to demonstrate "
the ability to react well to pres- 
  665 "sure and so forth,” said Professo"
"r McGonagall, “perseverance and ded-"
"ication, because Auror training take"
"s a further three years, not to men-"
tion very high skills in practical defens
e. It will mean a lot more study 
"even after you’ve left school, so"
 unless you’re prepared to —” 
"“I think you’ll also find,” said Um"
"bridge, her voice very cold now, "
“that the Ministry looks into the re
cords of those applying to be Au-
rora. Their criminal records.” 
“— unless you’re prepared to 
take even more exams after Hog-
"warts, you should really look at another —” "
“— which means that this boy has 
as much chance of becoming an 
Auror as Dumbledore has of ever
 returning to this school.” 
"“A very good chance, then,” said Professor McGonagall. "
“Potter has a criminal record
",” said Umbridge loudly. "
“Potter has been cleared of all char
"ges,” said Professor McGonagall, "
even more loudly. 
Professor Umbridge stood up. She wa
s so short that this did not 
"make a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanor "
had given place to a hard fury that 
"made her broad, flabby face look "
oddly sinister. 
“Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!” 
Professor McGonagall got to her feet
" too, and in her "
case this was a 
much more impressive move. She 
towered over Professor Umbridge. 
"“Potter,” she said in ringing tones, "
“I will assist you to become an 
Auror if it is the last thing I do! If
 I have to coach you nightly I will 
make sure you achieve the required results!” 
“The Minister of Magic will neve
r employ Harry Potter!” said Um-
"bridge, her voice rising furiously. "
“There may well be a new Minister of Magic by the time Potter is 
ready to join!” shoute
d Professor McGonagall. 
“Aha!” shrieked Professor Umbridge
", pointing a stubby finger at "
"McGonagall. “Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Of "
"course! That’s what you want, isn’t  "
 666 "it, Minerva McGonagall? You want "
Cornelius Fudge replaced by Al-
"bus Dumbledore! You think you’ll be where I am, don’t you, Senior "
Undersecretary to the Minister and headmistress to boot!” 
"“You are raving,” said Professor "
"McGonagall, superbly disdainful. "
"“Potter, that concludes ou"
r career consultation.” 
Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the 
"room, not daring to look at Umbrid"
ge. He could hear her and Profes-
sor McGonagall continuing to shout 
at each other al
l the way back 
along the corridor. 
Professor Umbridge was 
still breathing as thou
gh she had just run 
a race when she strode into their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson 
that afternoon. 
"“I hope you’ve thought better of what you were planning to do, "
"Harry,” Hermione whispered, the "
moment they had opened their 
books to chapter thirty-four (“No
n-Retaliation and Negotiation”). 
“Umbridge looks like she’s in a re
ally bad mood already. . . .” 
Every now and then Umbridge shot
" glowering looks at Harry, who "
"kept his head down, staring at "
"Defensive Magical Theory,"
 his eyes un-
"focused, thinking. . . . "
He could just imagine Professor Mc
Gonagall’s reaction if he were 
caught trespassing in Professor Umbr
idge’s office mere hours after she 
had vouched for him. . . . There was 
nothing to stop him simply go-
ing back to Gryffindor Tower and 
hoping that sometime during the 
next summer holiday he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the 
scene he had witnessed in the Pens
"ieve. . . . Nothing, except that "
the thought of taking this sensible 
course of action made him feel as 
though a lead weight 
had dropped into his stomach. . . . And then 
"there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already "
"planned, not to mention the knife "
"Sirius had given him, which was "
currently residing in his schoolbag 
along with his father’s old Invisi-
bility Cloak. . . . 
  667 But the fact remained that if he were caught . . . 
"“Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school, Harry!” "
"whispered Hermione, raising her b"
ook to hide her face from Um-
bridge. “And if you get thrown out 
today it will all have been for 
nothing!” 
He could abandon the plan and simp
ly learn to live with the mem-
ory of what his father had done on 
a summer’s day more than twenty 
years ago. . . . 
And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffin-
dor common room. . . .”You’re less li
ke your father than I thought. 
. . . The risk would’ve been what
 made it fun for James. . . .” 
But did he want to be like his father anymore? 
"“Harry, don’t do it, please don’t "
do it!” Hermione said in anguished 
tones as the bell rang at
 the end of the class. 
He did not answer; he did not know what to do. Ron seemed de-
termined to give neither his opin
ion nor his advice. He would not 
"look at Harry, though when Herm"
ione opened her mouth to try dis-
"suading Harry some more, he said in "
"a low voice, “Give it a rest, okay? "
He can make up 
his own mind.” 
Harry’s heart beat very fa
st as he left the classroom. He was halfway 
along the corridor outside when he 
heard the unmistakable sounds of 
a diversion going off in the distan
ce. There were screams and yells 
reverberating from somewhere above them. People exiting the class-
rooms all around Harry were stopping
 in their tracks and looking up 
at the ceiling fearfully — 
Then Umbridge came pelting out of
 her classroom as fast as her 
"short legs would carry her. Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the "
opposite direction: It was now or never. 
“Harry — please!” sa
id Hermione weakly. 
But he had made up his mind — hitching his bag more securely 
"onto his shoulder he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students  "
 668 now hurrying in the opposite directio
"n, off to see what all the fuss was "
about in the ea
st wing. . . . 
Harry reached the corridor where Um
bridge’s office was situated 
and found it deserted. Dashing be
hind a large suit of armor whose 
"helmet creaked around to watch him,"
" he pulled open his bag, seized "
"Sirius’s knife, and donned the Invisi"
bility Cloak. He then crept slowly 
and carefully back out 
from behind the suit of
 armor and along the 
corridor until he reac
hed Umbridge’s door. 
He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it 
"and moved it gently up and down, th"
en withdrew it. There was a tiny 
"click,"
" and the door swung open. He ducked inside the office, closed "
the door quickly behind hi
"m, and looked around. "
It was empty; nothing was moving
 except the horrible kittens on 
the plates continuing to frolic 
on the wall above the confiscated 
broomsticks. 
"Harry pulled off his cloak and, stridi"
"ng over to the fireplace, found "
what he was looking for within seco
nds: a small box containing glit-
tering Floo powder. 
He crouched down in front of the 
"empty grate, his hands shaking. "
"He had never done this before, thou"
gh he thought he knew how it 
must work. Sticking his head into th
"e fireplace, he took a large pinch "
of powder and dropped it onto th
e logs stacked neatly beneath him. 
They exploded at once into emerald-green flames. 
"“Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!” "
Harry said loudly and clearly. 
It was one of the most curious se
nsations he had ever experienced; 
he had traveled by Floo powder before
", of course, but then it had been "
his entire body that had spun around
 and around in the flames through 
the network of Wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country: 
"This time, his knees remained firm "
upon the cold floor of Umbridge’s 
"office, and only his head hurtle"
d through the emer
ald fire. . . . 
"And then, abruptly as it had begun,"
 the spinning stopped. Feeling  
  669 rather sick and as though he was 
wearing an exceptionally hot muffler 
"around his head, Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up "
out of the kitchen fireplace at the 
"long, wooden table, where a man sat "
poring over a piec
e of parchment. 
“Sirius?” 
"The man jumped and looked around. It was not Sirius, but Lupin. "
"“Harry!” he said, looking thorou"
ghly shocked. “What are you — 
"what’s happened, is "
everything all right?” 
"“Yeah,” said Harry. “I just wonder"
"ed — I mean, I just fancied a — "
a chat with Sirius.” 
"“I’ll call him,” said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking perplexed. "
“He went upstairs to look for Kreacher
", he seems to be hiding in the at-"
tic again. . . .” 
And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of th
e kitchen. Now he was left 
with nothing to look at but the ch
air and table legs. He wondered why 
Sirius had never mentioned how ve
ry uncomfortable it was to speak 
out of the fire — his knees were al
ready objecting painfully to their 
prolonged contact with Umbr
idge’s hard stone floor. 
Lupin returned with Sirius 
at his heels moments later. 
“What is it?” said Sirius urgently
", sweeping his long dark hair out "
of his eyes and dropping to the ground
" in front of the fire, so that he "
and Harry were on a level; Lupin 
"knelt down too, looking very con-"
cerned. “Are you all righ
t? Do you need help?” 
"“No,” said Harry, “it’s "
nothing like that. . . . I just wanted to talk 
. . . about my dad. . . .” 
They exchanged a look of great 
"surprise, but Harry did not have "
time to feel awkward or embarrasse
d; his knees were becoming sorer 
"by the second, and he guessed that five minutes had already passed "
from the start of the diversion — 
George had only guaranteed him 
twenty. He therefore plunged immedi
ately into the story of what he 
had seen in the Pensieve. 
 670 "When he had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a mo-"
"ment. Then Lupin said quietly, “I wouldn’t like you to judge your "
"father on what you saw there, "
Harry. He was only fifteen —” 
“I’m fifteen!” said Harry heatedly. 
"“Look, Harry,” said Sirius placatin"
"gly, “James and Snape hated each "
"other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of "
"those things, you can understand th"
"at, can’t you? I think James was "
everything Snape wanted to be — 
"he was popular, he was good at "
"Quidditch, good at pretty much ev"
erything. And Snape was just this 
little oddball who was up to his ey
es in the Dark Arts and James — 
whatever else he may have appear
"ed to you, Harry — always hated "
the Dark Arts.” 
"“Yeah,” said Harry, “but he just "
"attacked Snape for no good reason, "
"just because — well, just because "
"you said you were bored,” he fin-"
ished with a slightly apolog
etic note in his voice. 
"“I’m not proud of it,” "
said Sirius quickly. 
Lupin looked sideways at Sirius 
"and then said, “Look, Harry, what "
you’ve got to understand is that your
 father and Sirius were the best in 
the school at whatever
 they did — everyone 
thought they were the 
height of cool — if they some
times got a bit carried away —” 
“If we were sometimes arrogant litt
"le berks, you mean,” said Sirius. "
Lupin smiled. 
"“He kept messing up his hair,” "
said Harry in a pained voice. 
Sirius and Lupin laughed. 
“I’d forgotten he used to do that
",” said Sirius affectionately. "
“Was he playing with the Snitch?” said Lupin eagerly. 
"“Yeah,” said Harry, watching unco"
mprehendingly as Sirius and 
Lupin beamed reminiscently. “Well . 
. . I thought he was a bit of an 
idiot.” 
“Of course he was a bit of an idiot!
” said Sirius bracingly. “We were 
all idiots! Well — not Moony so much
",” he said fairly, looking at "
"Lupin, but Lupin shook his head. "
  671 “Did I ever tell you to lay off Snap
e?” he said. “Did I ever have the 
guts to tell you I though
t you were out of order?” 
"“Yeah, well,” said Sirius, “you made us feel ashamed of ourselves "
sometimes. . . . That 
was something. . . .” 
"“And,” said Harry doggedly, determ"
ined to say everything that was 
"on his mind now he was here, “he kept"
 looking over at the girls by the 
"lake, hoping they we"
re watching him!” 
"“Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was "
"around,” said Sirius, shrugging. “He "
couldn’t stop himself showing off 
whenever he got near her.” 
“How come she married him?” Ha
rry asked miserably. “She hated 
him!” 
"“Nah, she didn’t,”"
 said Sirius. 
“She started going out with him 
"in seventh year,” said Lupin. "
“Once James had deflated his 
"head a bit,” said Sirius. "
“And stopped hexing people just 
"for the fun of it,” said Lupin. "
“Even Snape?” said Harry. 
"“Well,” said Lupin slowly, “Snape was a special case. I mean, he "
never lost an opportunity to curse Ja
"mes, so you couldn’t really expect "
James to take that ly
"ing down, could you?” "
“And my mum was okay with that?” 
“She didn’t know too much about it
", to tell you the truth,” said Sir-"
"ius. “I mean, James didn’t take Sn"
ape on dates with her and jinx him 
"in front of her, did he?” "
Sirius frowned at Ha
"rry, who was still looking unconvinced. "
"“Look,” he said, “your father was th"
"e best friend I ever had, and he "
was a good person. A lot of people ar
e idiots at the ag
e of fifteen. He 
grew out of it.” 
"“Yeah, okay,” said Harry heavily. "
“I just never thought I’d feel sorry 
for Snape.” 
"“Now you mention it,” said Lupin,"
 a faint crease 
between his eye-
"brows, “how did Snape "
react when he found yo
u’d seen all this?” 
 672 “He told me he’d never teach me
" Occlumency again,” said Harry "
"indifferently, “like that"
’s a big disappoint —” 
"“He WHAT?” shouted Sirius, causing Harry to jump and inhale a "
mouthful of ashes. 
"“Are you serious, Harry?” said Lu"
pin quickly. “He’s stopped giving 
you lessons?” 
"“Yeah,” said Harry, surprised at what"
 he considered a great overreac-
"tion. “But it’s okay, I don’t care, it’s"
 a bit of a relief to tell you the —” 
“I’m coming up there to have a wo
rd with Snape!” said Sirius force-
"fully and he actually made to stand up, but Lupin wrenched him back "
down again. 
“If anyone’s going to tell Snape it wi
ll be me!” he said firmly. “But 
"Harry, first of all, you’re"
 to go back to Snape and 
tell him that on no ac-
count is he to stop giving you 
lessons — when Dumbledore hears —” 
"“I can’t tell him that, he’d kill "
"me!” said Harry, outraged. “You "
didn’t see him when we go
t out of the Pensieve —” 
"“Harry, there is nothing so important as you learning Occlu-"
mency!” said Lupin sternly. “D
o you understand
 me? Nothing!” 
"“Okay, okay,” said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention "
annoyed. “I’ll . . . I’ll try and say 
something to him. . . . But it won’t 
be . . .” 
He fell silent. He could 
hear distant footsteps. 
“Is that Kreacher coming downstairs?” 
"“No,” said Sirius, glancing behind"
 him. “It must be somebody your 
end . . .” 
Harry’s heart skipped several beats. 
“I’d better go!” he said hastily an
d he pulled his head backward out 
of Grimmauld Place’s fire. For a mo
ment his head seemed to be re-
"volving on his shoulders, and then he"
 found himself kneeling in front 
"of Umbridge’s fire with his head firmly back on, watching the emerald "
flames flicker and die. 
  673 "“Quickly, quickly!” he heard a wh"
eezy voice mutter right outside 
"the office door. “Ah, she’"
s left it op
en. . . .” 
Harry dived for the Invisibility Cl
oak and had just managed to pull 
it back over himself when Filch burs
t into the office. He looked ab-
solutely delighted about something and was talking to himself fever-
"ishly as he crossed the room, pull"
ed open a drawer in Umbridge’s 
"desk, and began rifling through the papers inside it. "
“Approval for Whipping . . . Approval for Whipping . . . I can do it 
at last. . . . They’ve 
had it coming to them for years. . . .” 
He pulled out a piece of parchmen
"t, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly "
"back out of the door, clut"
ching it to his chest. 
"Harry leapt to his feet and, making "
sure that he had his bag and the 
"Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open "
"the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling "
along faster than Harry 
had ever seen him go. 
One landing down from Umbridge’s
 office and Harry thought it 
was safe to become visible again; he 
pulled off the cloa
"k, shoved it in "
his bag and hurried onward. There wa
s a great deal of shouting and 
movement coming from the entranc
e hall. He ran down the marble 
staircase and found what looked li
ke most of the school assembled 
there. 
It was just like the night when
 Trelawney had been sacked. Stu-
dents were standing all around the wa
"lls in a great ring (some of them, "
"Harry noticed, covered in a substance "
that looked very 
like Stinksap); 
teachers and ghosts were also in 
the crowd. Prominent among the on-
lookers were members of the Inquis
"itorial Squad, who were all look-"
ing exceptionally pleased with 
"themselves, and Peeves, who was "
"bobbing overhead, gazed down upon"
" Fred and George, who stood in "
the middle of the floor with the unmi
stakable look of two people who 
had just been cornered. 
"“So!” said Umbridge triumphantly, whom Harry realized was  "
 674 standing just a few stairs in fr
"ont of him, once more looking down "
upon her prey. “So . . . you think it
 amusing to turn a school corridor 
"into a swamp, do you?” "
"“Pretty amusing, yeah,” said Fred"
", looking back up"
 at her without 
the slightest sign of fear. 
Filch elbowed his way closer to 
"Umbridge, almost crying with "
happiness. 
"“I’ve got the form, Headmistress,” "
"he said hoarsely, waving the "
piece of parchment Harry had just s
een him take from her desk. “I’ve 
got the form and I’ve got the whip
s waiting. . . . 
"Oh, let me do it "
now. . . .” 
"“Very good, Argus,” she said. “You"
" two,” she went on, gazing down "
"at Fred and George, “are about to "
learn what happens to wrongdoers 
in my school.” 
“You know what?” said Fred
. “I don’t think we are.” 
He turned to his twin. 
"“George,” said Fred, “I think we’ve outgrown full-time education.” "
"“Yeah, I’ve been feeling that wa"
"y myself,” said George lightly. "
“Time to test our talents in the 
"real world, d’you reckon?” asked "
Fred. 
"“Definitely,” said George. "
And before Umbridge could say a 
"word, they raised their wands "
"and said together, “"
Accio Brooms
!” 
Harry heard a loud crash somewher
e in the distan
ce. Looking to 
his left he ducked just in time 
"— Fred and George’s broomsticks, "
one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge 
"had fastened them to the wall, were"
 hurtling along the corridor to-
ward their owners. They turned l
"eft, streaked down the stairs, and "
"stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on "
the flagged stone floor. 
"“We won’t be seeing you,” Fred to"
"ld Professor Umbridge, swinging "
his leg over his broomstick. 
  675 "“Yeah, don’t bother to keep in "
"touch,” said George, mounting his "
own. 
"Fred looked around at the assembled students, and at the silent, "
watchful crowd. 
“If anyone fancies buying
" a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated up-"
"stairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley — Weasleys’ Wiz-"
"arding Wheezes,” he said in a lo"
ud voice. “Our new premises!” 
“Special discounts to Hogwarts st
udents who swear they’re going to 
use our products to get rid of this 
"old bat,” added George, pointing at "
Professor Umbridge. 
"“STOP THEM!” shrieked Umbridge, "
but it was too late. As the In-
"quisitorial Squad closed in, Fred an"
"d George kicked off from the floor, "
"shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously "
below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his 
level above the crowd. 
"“Give her hell from us, Peeves.” "
"And Peeves, whom Harry had never "
seen take an order from a stu-
"dent before, swept his belled hat from"
 his head and sprang to a salute 
as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the 
students below and sped out of the 
open front doors into the glorious 
sunset. 
The story of Fred and George’s flight to freedom was retold so of-
ten over the next few days that 
Harry could tell it would soon 
become the stuff of Hogwarts lege
"nd. Within a week, even those who "
had been eyewitnesses were half-c
onvinced that they had seen the 
twins dive-bomb Umbridge on thei
"r brooms, pelting her with Dung-"
bombs before zooming out of the 
doors. In the immediate aftermath 
of their departure there was a great 
"wave of talk about copying them, "
so that Harry frequently heard stud
"ents saying things like, “Honestly, "
some days I just feel like jumpin
g on my broom and leaving this 
"place,” or else, “One more lesson "
like that and I might just do a 
Weasley. . . .” 
Fred and George had made sure th
at nobody was likely to forget 
"them very soon. For one thing, they "
had not left instructions on how 
to remove the swamp that now filled
 the corridor on the fifth floor of 
the east wing. Umbridge and Filch 
had been observed trying different 
means of removing it but without 
success. Eventually the area was 
"roped off and Filch, gnashing his teet"
"h furiously, was given the task of "
punting students across it to thei
r classrooms. Harry was certain that 
T 
  677 teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp 
"in an instant, but just as in the case of Fred and George’s Wildfire "
"Whiz-Bangs, they seemed to pref"
er to watch Umbridge struggle. 
Then there were the two large br
oom-shaped holes in Umbridge’s 
"office door, through which Fred "
and George’s Cleansweeps had 
smashed to rejoin their masters. 
Filch fitted a new door and removed 
Harry’s Firebolt to the dungeons wh
"ere, it was rumored, Umbridge "
"had set an armed security troll to guard it. However, her troubles were "
far from over. 
Inspired by Fred and George’s ex
"ample, a great number of students "
were now vying for the newly vacant
 positions of Troublemakers-in-
"Chief. In spite of the new door, so"
mebody managed to slip a hairy-
"snouted niffler into Umbridge’s office, which promptly tore the place "
apart in its search for shiny object
"s, leapt on Umbridge on her reen-"
"trance, and tried to gnaw the rings "
off her stubby fingers. Dungbombs 
and Stinkpellets were dropped so freq
uently in the corridors that it be-
came the new fashion for students 
to perform Bubble-Head Charms 
on themselves before leaving lessons
", which ensured them a supply of "
"fresh clean air, even though it gave "
them all the peculi
ar appearance of 
wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads. 
Filch prowled the corridors with a 
"horsewhip ready in his hands, "
"desperate to catch miscreants, but the problem was that there were "
now so many of them that he di
d not know which way to turn. The 
Inquisitorial Squad were attempting
" to help him, but odd things kept "
happening to its members. Warrin
gton of the Slytherin Quidditch 
team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that 
made him look as though he had 
been coated in cornflakes. Pansy 
"Parkinson, to Hermione’s delight, "
missed all her lessons the following 
"day, as she had sprouted antlers. "
Meanwhile it became clear just ho
w many Skiving Snackboxes Fred 
and George had managed to sell b
efore leaving Hogwarts. Umbridge 
only had to enter her 
classroom for the student
s assembled there to 
 678 "faint, vomit, develop dangerous fever"
"s, or else spout blood from both "
nostrils. Shrieking with rage and fr
ustration she attempted to trace the 
mysterious symptoms to their sour
"ce, but the students told her stub-"
bornly they were suffering “Umbridg
e-itis.” After putting four succes-
sive classes in detention and failin
g to discover their secret she was 
forced to give up and allow the 
"bleeding, swooning, sweating, and "
vomiting students to leav
e her classes in droves. 
But not even the users of the Snac
kboxes could compete with that 
"master of chaos, Peeves, who seem"
ed to have taken Fred’s parting 
words deeply to heart. Cackling ma
"dly, he soared through the school, "
"upending tables, bursting out of "
"blackboards, and toppling statues "
"and vases. Twice he shut Mrs. Norris inside suits of armor, from which "
"she was rescued, yowling loudly, by "
the furious caretaker. He smashed 
"lanterns and snuffed out candles, "
juggled burning torches over the 
"heads of screaming students, caused"
 neatly stacked piles of parchment 
"to topple into fires or out of windows, flooded the second floor when "
he pulled off all the taps in the 
"bathrooms, dropped "
a bag of tarantu-
las in the middle of th
e Great Hall during brea
"kfast and, whenever he "
"fancied a break, spent ho"
urs at a time floating along after Umbridge 
and blowing loud raspberrie
s every time she spoke. 
None of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help 
"her. Indeed, a week after Fred and "
George’s departure Harry witnessed 
Professor McGonagall walking ri
"ght past Peeves, who was deter-"
minedly loosening a crystal chandeli
"er, and could have sworn he heard "
her tell the poltergeist out of the co
"rner of her mouth, “It unscrews "
the other way.” 
"To cap matters, Montague had stil"
l not recovered from his sojourn 
in the toilet. He remained confuse
d and disorientated and his parents 
were to be observed one Tuesday mo
"rning striding up the front drive, "
looking extremely angry. 
"“Should we say something?” said Hermione in a worried voice, "
pressing her cheek against the Char
ms window so that she could see 
  679 Mr. and Mrs. Montague marching 
inside. “About what happened to 
him? In case it helps 
Madam Pomfrey cure him?” 
"“’Course not, he’ll recover,"
” said Ron indifferently. 
"“Anyway, more trouble for Umbridge"
", isn’t it?” said Harry in a sat-"
isfied voice. 
He and Ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be 
charming with their wands. Harry’s spouted four very short legs that 
would not reach the desk and wriggl
ed pointlessly in midair. Ron’s 
grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with 
"great difficulty, trembled for a few "
"seconds, then folded, causing the "
cup to crack into two. 
“
Reparo
"!” said Hermione quickly, m"
ending Ron’s cup with a wave 
"of her wand. “That’s all very well, but what if Montague’s perma-"
nently injured?” 
"“Who cares?” said Ron irritably,"
 while his teacup stood drunkenly 
"again, trembling violently at th"
e knees. “Montague shouldn’t have 
tried to take all those points from 
"Gryffindor, should he? If you want "
"to worry about anyone, He"
"rmione, worry about me!” "
"“You?” she said, catching her teacup as it scampered happily away "
across the desk on four sturdy little willow-patterned legs and replac-
ing it in front of he
r. “Why should I be
 worried about you?” 
“When Mum’s next letter finally gets through Umbridge’s screen-
"ing process,” said Ron bitterly, now "
holding his cup up while its frail 
legs tried feebly to support its weig
"ht, “I’m going to be in deep trou-"
ble. I wouldn’t be 
surprised if she’s sent a Howler again.” 
“But —” 
“It’ll be my fault Fred and George
" left, you wait,” said Ron darkly. "
“She’ll say I should’ve stopped them
" leaving, I should’ve grabbed the "
ends of their brooms and hung on or 
"something. . . . Yeah, it’ll be all "
my fault. . . .” 
"“Well, if she "
does
" say that it’ll be very unfair, you couldn’t have done "
"anything! But I’m sure she won’t, I mean, if it’s really true they’ve got "
 680 "premises in Diagon Alley now, they "
must have been pl
anning this for 
ages. . . .” 
"“Yeah, but that’s another thing, how did they get premises?” said "
"Ron, hitting his teacup so hard with"
 his wand that its legs collapsed 
"again and it lay twitching before him. “It’s a bit dodgy, isn’t it? They’ll "
need loads of Galleons to afford the 
"rent on a place in Diagon Alley, "
she’ll want to know what they’ve been 
"up to, to get their hands on that "
sort of gold. . . .” 
"“Well, yes, that occurred to me too,” said Hermione, allowing her "
"teacup to jog in neat little circles around Harry’s, whose stubby little "
legs were still unable to touch 
the desktop. “I’ve been wondering 
whether Mundungus has persuaded 
them to sell stolen goods or 
something awful. . . .” 
"“He hasn’t,” said Harry curtly. "
“How do you know?” said Ro
n and Hermione together. 
"“Because —” Harry hesitated, bu"
t the moment to confess finally 
seemed to have come. There was no good to be gained in keeping 
silent if it meant anyone suspected that Fred and George were crimi-
nals. “Because they got the gold fr
om me. I gave them my Triwizard 
winnings last June.” 
"There was a shocked silence, then "
Hermione’s teacup jogged right 
over the edge of the desk 
and smashed on
 the floor. 
"“Oh, Harry, you "
didn’t
!”
she said. 
"“Yes, I did,” said Harry mutinously. “And I don’t regret it either — "
"I didn’t need the gold, and they’ll "
be great at a jo
ke shop. . . .” 
"“But this is excellent!” said Ron, lo"
"oking thrilled. “It’s all your fault, "
Harry — Mum can’t blame me 
at all! Can 
I tell her?” 
"“Yeah, I suppose you’d better,” sa"
id Harry dully. “’Specially if she 
thinks they’re receiving stolen cauldrons or something. . . .” 
Hermione said nothing at all for 
"the rest of the lesson, but Harry "
had a shrewd suspicion that her self
-restraint was bound to crack be- 
  681 "fore long. Sure enough, once they "
had left the castle for break and 
"were standing around in the weak May sunshine, she fixed Harry with "
a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air. 
Harry interrupted her before
 she had even started. 
"“It’s no good nagging me, it’s done,” he said firmly. “Fred and "
George have got the gold
 — spent a good bit of it
" too, by the sounds "
of it — and I can’t get it back from
 them and I don’t want to. So save 
"your breath, Hermione.” "
“I wasn’t going to say anything ab
out Fred and George!” she said in 
an injured voice. 
Ron snorted disbelievingly and 
Hermione threw him a very dirty 
look. 
"“No, I wasn’t!” she said angrily. “A"
"s a matter of fact, I was going to "
ask Harry when he’s going to go 
back to Snape and ask for Occlu-
mency lessons again!” 
Harry’s heart sank. Once they had 
exhausted the subject of Fred 
"and George’s dramatic departure,"
 which admittedly had taken many 
"hours, Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news of Sirius. As "
Harry had not confided in them the re
ason he had wanted to talk to 
"Sirius in the first place, it had be"
en hard to think of things to tell 
them. He had ended up saying to them truthfully that Sirius wanted 
Harry to resume Occlumency lessons.
 He had been regretting this 
ever since; Hermione would not let 
the subject drop and kept revert-
ing to it when Harry least expected it. 
"“You can’t tell me you’ve stopped having funny dreams,” Hermione "
"said now, “because Ron told me last"
 night you were muttering in your 
sleep again. . . .” 
Harry threw Ron a furious look. 
Ron had the grace to look 
ashamed of himself. 
“You were only muttering a bi
"t,” he mumbled apologetically. "
“Something about ‘just a bit farther.’” 
 682 “I dreamed I was watching you lo
"t play Quidditch,” Harry lied "
brutally. “I was trying to
 get you to stretch out a 
bit farther to grab the 
Quaffle.” 
Ron’s ears went red. Harry felt a kind
 of vindictive pleasure: He had 
"not, of course, dreamed anything of the sort. "
Last night he had once again ma
de the journey along the Depart-
ment of Mysteries corridor. He had 
"passed through the circular room, "
then the room full of clicking an
"d dancing light, until he found him-"
self again inside that cavernous r
oom full of shelves on which were 
ranged dusty glass spheres. . . . 
He had hurried straight toward 
"row number ninety-seven, turned "
"left, and ran along it. . "
. . It had probably been
 then that he had spo-
ken aloud. . . . 
Just a bit farther
 . . . for he could feel his conscious self 
struggling to wake . . . and before 
"he had reached the end of the row, "
he had found himself lying in bed ag
"ain, gazing up at the canopy of "
his four-poster. 
“You are 
trying
" to block your mind, aren’t"
" you?” said Hermione, look-"
ing beadily at Harry. “You are keep
ing going with your Occlumency?” 
"“Of course I am,” said Harry, trying"
 to sound as though this ques-
"tion was insulting, but not quite m"
eeting her eye. The truth was that 
he was so intensely curious about wh
at was hidden in that room full 
of dusty orbs that he was quite 
keen for the dreams to continue. 
The problem was that with just under a month to go until the ex-
ams and every free moment devote
"d to studying, his mind seemed "
saturated with information when he we
nt to bed so that he found it 
very difficult to get to sleep at all.
" When he did, his overwrought brain "
presented him most nights with st
upid dreams about the exams. He 
also suspected that part of his mi
nd — the part that
 often spoke in 
Hermione’s voice — now felt guilty 
on the occasions it strayed down 
that corridor ending in the black door
", and sought to wake him before "
he could reach journey’s end. 
"“You know,” said Ron, whose ears"
" were still flaming red, “if Mon-"
  683 tague doesn’t recover before Slytheri
"n play Hufflepuff, we might be in "
with a chance of winning the Cup.” 
"“Yeah, I s’pose so,” said Harry,"
 glad of a change of subject. 
"“I mean, we’ve won one, lost one "
— if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff 
next Saturday —” 
"“Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry, lo"
sing track of what he was agree-
ing to: Cho Chang had just walked
" across the courtyard, deter-"
minedly not looking at him. 
The final match of the Quidditch 
"season, Gryffindor versus Raven-"
"claw, was to take place on the last weekend of May. Although "
Slytherin had been narrowly defeated
 by Hufflepuff in their last 
"match, Gryffindor was not daring "
"to hope for victory, due mainly "
(though of course nobody said it 
to him) to Ron’s abysmal goalkeep-
"ing record. He, howeve"
"r, seemed to have found a new optimism. "
"“I mean, I can’t get any worse, "
can I?” he told Harry and Hermione 
grimly over breakfast on the mornin
g of the match. “Nothing to lose 
"now, is there?” "
"“You know,” said Hermione, as "
she and Harry walked down to the 
pitch a little later in the midst of 
a very excitable crow
"d, “I think Ron "
might do better without Fred and George around. They never exactly 
gave him a lot of 
confidence. . . .” 
Luna Lovegood overtook them with 
what appeared to be a live ea-
gle perched on top of her head. 
"“Oh gosh, I forgot!” said Hermione"
", watching the eagle flapping its "
wings as Luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing 
"Slytherins. “Cho will be playing, won’t she?” "
"Harry, who had not forgotte"
"n this, merely grunted. "
They found seats in the topmost ro
"w of the stands. It was a fine, "
clear day. Ron could not wish fo
"r better, and Harry found himself "
hoping against hope that Ron would 
not give the Slytherins cause for 
more rousing choruses of “Weasley Is Our King.” 
 684 "Lee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred and George "
"had left, was commentating as usual. As the teams zoomed out onto "
the pitches he named the players wi
th something less than his usual 
gusto. 
“. . . Bradley . . . Davies . . . 
"Chang,” he said, and Harry felt his "
"stomach perform, less of a back "
"flip, more a feeble lurch as Cho "
"walked out onto the pitch, her shiny "
black hair rippling in the slight 
breeze. He was not sure what he 
"wanted to happen anymore, except "
that he could not stand any more rows. Even the sight of her chatting 
animatedly to Roger Davies as th
ey prepared to 
mount their brooms 
caused him only a slight
 twinge of jealousy. 
“And they’re off!” said Lee. “And
 Davies takes the Quaffle immedi-
"ately, Ravenclaw Captain Davies wi"
"th the Quaffle, he dodges John-"
"son, he dodges Bell, he dodges Spinnet "
as well. . . . He’s going straight 
for goal! He’s going to shoot 
— and — and —” Lee swore very 
loudly. “And he’s scored.” 
Harry and Hermione groaned with the rest of the Gryffindors. Pre-
"dictably, horribly, the Slytherins on "
the other side of the stands began 
to sing: 
Weasley cannot 
"save a thing, "
He cannot block a single ring . . .
"“Harry,” said a hoarse voice in"
 Harry’s ear. “H
ermione . . .” 
Harry looked around and saw Hagrid’s enormous bearded face 
sticking between the seats; apparen
tly he had squeezed his way all 
"along the row behind, for the first an"
d second years he had just passed 
"had a ruffled, flattened look about "
"them. For some reason, Hagrid was "
bent double as though anxious not to
" be seen, though he was still at "
least four feet taller
 than everybody else. 
"“Listen,” he whispered, “can yeh "
come with me? No
w? While ev’ry-
one’s watchin’ the match?” 
  685 "“Er . . . can’t it wait, Hagrid?” "
asked Harry. “Till the match is 
over? 
"“No,” said Hagrid. “No, Harry, it’s"
 gotta be now . . . while ev’ry-
one’s lookin’ the other 
way. . . . Please?” 
Hagrid’s nose was gently dripping
 blood. His eyes were both black-
ened. Harry had not seen him this close up since his return to the 
school; he looked utterly woebegone. 
"“’Course,” said Harry at once"
", “’course we’ll come. . . .” "
He and Hermione edged back alon
"g their row of seats, causing "
much grumbling among the students 
who had to stand up for them. 
The people in Hagrid’s row were no
"t complaining, merely attempting "
to make themselves as small as possible. 
"“I ’ppreciate this, you two, I really"
" do,” said Hagrid as they reached "
the stairs. He kept looking around
 nervously as they descended to-
ward the lawn below. “I jus’ hope she doesn’ notice us goin’. . . .” 
"“You mean Umbridge?” said Harry. “She won’t, she’s got her whole "
"Inquisitorial Squad sitting with her,"
 didn’t you see? She must be ex-
pecting trouble at the match.” 
"“Yeah, well, a bit o’ trouble wouldn’ hurt,” said Hagrid, pausing to "
peer around the edge of the stands to
 make sure the stretch of lawn be-
tween there and his cabin was desert
ed. “Give us more time . . .” 
"“What is it, Hagrid?” said Herm"
"ione, looking up at him with a "
concerned expression on her face as
 they hurried across the lawn to-
ward the edge of the forest. 
"“Yeh — yeh’ll see in a mo’,” said "
"Hagrid, looking ov"
er his shoulder 
as a great roar rose from the st
ands behind them. “Hey — did some-
one jus’ score?” 
"“It’ll be Ravenclaw,” said Harry heavily. "
“Good . . . good . . .” said Hagrid
 distractedly. “Tha’s good. . . .” 
"They had to jog to keep up with him as he strode across the lawn, "
looking around with every other st
"ep. When they reached his cabin, "
Hermione turned automatically le
"ft toward the front door; Hagrid, "
 686 "however, walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the out-"
"ermost edge of the forest, where he picked up a crossbow that was "
leaning against a tree. When he realized
" they were no longer with him, "
he turned. 
"“We’re goin’ in here,” he said, je"
rking his shaggy head behind him. 
“Into the forest?” said
" Hermione, perplexed. "
"“Yeah,” said Hagrid. “C’mon now, quick, before we’re spotted!” "
Harry and Hermione looked at each
" other, then ducked into the "
"cover of the trees behind Hagrid, who was already striding away from "
"them into the green gloom, his crossbow over his arm. Harry and "
Hermione ran to catch up with him. 
"“Hagrid, why are you armed?” said Harry. "
"“Jus’ a precaution,” said Hagrid, "
shrugging his massive shoulders. 
“You didn’t bring your crossbow 
the day you showed us the thes-
"trals,” said Hermione timidly. "
"“Nah, well, we weren’ goin’ in so"
" far then,” said Hagrid. “An’ any-"
"way, tha’ was before"
 Firenze left the 
"forest, wasn’ it?” "
“Why does Firenze leaving make
 a difference?” asked Hermione 
curiously. 
"“’Cause the other centaurs are good an’ riled at me, tha’s why,” said "
"Hagrid quietly, glancing around. “They used ter be — well, yeh "
couldn’ call ’em friendly — but we go
t on all righ’. Kept ’emselves to 
"’emselves, bu’ always turned up if I wanted a word. Not anymore . . .” "
He sighed deeply. 
“Firenze said that they’re angry be
cause he went to work for Dum-
"bledore?” Harry asked, tripping on "
a protruding root because he was 
busy watching Hagrid’s profile. 
"“Yeah,” said Hagrid heavily. “W"
"ell, angry doesn’ cover it. Ruddy "
"livid. If I hadn’ stepped in, I re"
ckon they’d’ve kicked Firenze ter 
death —” 
“They attacked him?” said He
"rmione, sounding shocked. "
  687 "“Yep,” said Hagrid gruffly, fo"
rcing his way through several low-
hanging branches. “He had ha
lf the herd onto him —” 
"“And you stopped it?” said Harry, amazed and impressed. “By "
yourself?” 
"“’Course I did, couldn’t stand by"
 an’ watch ’em ki
"ll him, could I?” "
"said Hagrid. “Lucky I was passin’, rea"
lly . . . an’ I’d’ve thought Firenze 
mighta remembered tha’ before he started sendin’ me stupid warnin’s!” 
he added hotly an
d unexpectedly. 
Harry and Hermione looked at each
" other, startled, but Hagrid, "
"scowling, did not elaborate. "
"“Anyway,” he said, breathing a little"
" more heavily than usual, “since "
then the other centaurs’ve bin livid wi
"th me an’ the trouble is, they’ve "
got a lot of influence in the forest. . 
. . Cleverest creatures in here . . .” 
"“Is that why we’re here, Hagrid?” asked Hermione. “The centaurs?” "
"“Ah no,” said Hagrid, shaking his head dismissively, “no, it’s not "
"them. . . . Well, o’ course, they co"
"uld complicate the problem, yeah. "
. . . But yeh’ll see what 
I mean in a bit. . . .” 
On this incomprehensible note he fell silent and forged a little 
"ahead, taking one stride for every three of theirs, so that they had great "
trouble keeping up with him. 
The path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew 
so closely together as they walked 
farther and farther into the forest 
that it was as dark as dusk. They 
were soon a long way past the clear-
ing where Hagrid had shown them 
"the thestrals, but Harry felt no "
sense of unease until Hagrid step
ped unexpectedly off the path and 
began wending his way in and out of trees toward the dark heart of 
the forest. 
"“Hagrid?” said Harry, fighting "
his way through thickly knotted 
brambles over which Hagrid had 
stepped easily and remembering 
very vividly what had happened to him
 on the other occasions he had 
stepped off the forest path. “Where are we going?” 
 688 "“Bit further,” said Hagrid over "
"his shoulder. “C’mon, Harry. . . . "
We need ter keep to
gether now. . . .” 
It was a great struggle to keep up
" with Hagrid, what with branches "
and thickets of thorn through which Hagrid marched as easily as 
"though they were cobwebs, but wh"
ich snagged Harry and Hermione’s 
"robes, frequently entangling them so "
severely that they had to stop for 
minutes at a time to fr
ee themselves. Harry’s arms
 and legs were soon 
covered in small cuts and scratches. 
They were so deep in the forest 
now that sometimes all Harry could s
ee of Hagrid in the gloom was a 
massive dark shape ahead of him. An
y sound seemed threatening in the 
muffled silence. The breaking of a 
twig echoed loudly and the tiniest 
"rustle of movement, though it migh"
t have been made by an innocent 
"sparrow, caused Harry to peer th"
rough the gloom for a culprit. It 
occurred to him that he had never ma
naged to get this far into the for-
est without meeting some kind of cr
eature — their absence struck him 
as rather ominous. 
"“Hagrid, would it be all right if"
 we lit our wands?” said Hermione 
quietly. 
"“Er . . . all righ’,” Hagrid wh"
ispered back. “In fact . . .” 
He stopped suddenly and turned around; Hermione walked right 
into him and was knocked over ba
ckward. Harry caught her just be-
fore she hit the forest floor. 
“Maybe we bes’ jus’ stop fer a mom
"en’, so I can . . . fill yeh in,” said "
"Hagrid. “Before we ge’ there, like.” "
"“Good!” said Hermione, as Harry set her back on her feet. They "
both murmured “
Lumos
!” and their wand tips 
ignited. Hagrid’s face 
swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and 
Harry saw that he looked nervous and sad again. 
"“Righ,” said Hagrid. “Well . . . "
see . . . the thing is . . .” 
He took a great breath. 
"“Well, there’s a good chance I’m goin’ ter be gettin’ the sack any day "
"now,” he said. "
  689 Harry and Hermione looked at ea
"ch other, then back at him. "
“But you’ve lasted this long —” 
Hermione said tentatively. “What 
makes you think —” 
“Umbridge reckons it wa
s me that put tha’ niffler in her office.” 
"“And was it?” said Harry, be"
fore he could stop himself. 
"“No, it ruddy well wasn’!” said Ha"
grid indignantly. “On’y anythin’ 
ter do with magical creatures an’ she thinks it’s got somethin’ ter do 
with me. Yeh know she’s 
bin lookin’ fer a chance 
ter get rid of me ever 
"since I got back. I don’ wan’ ter go, o’ course, but if it wasn’ fer . . . "
"well . . . the special circumstances I’m abou’ ter explain to yeh, I’d "
"leave righ now, before she’s go’ th"
e chance ter do it in front o’ the 
"whole school, like she "
did with Trelawney.” 
"Harry and Hermione both made noises of protest, but Hagrid "
overrode them with a wave of
 one of his enormous hands. 
"“It’s not the end o’ the world, I’ll be able ter help Dumbledore once "
"I’m outta here, I can be useful ter the Order. An’ you lot’ll have "
"Grubbly-Plank, yeh’ll — yeh’ll get "
through yer exams fine. . . .” His 
voice trembled and broke. 
"“Don’ worry abou’ me,” he said ha"
"stily, as Hermione made to pat "
his arm. He pulled his enormou
s spotted handkerchief from the 
pocket of his waistcoa
t and mopped his eyes wi
"th it. “Look, I wouldn’ "
"be tellin’ yer this at all if I didn’ have ter. See, if I go . . . well, I can’ "
leave withou’ . . . withou’ tellin’ someone . . . because I’ll — I’ll need 
"you two ter help me. An’ Ron, if he’s willin’.” "
"“Of course we’ll help you,” said"
 Harry at once. “What do you want 
us to do?” 
Hagrid gave a great sniff and pa
tted Harry wordlessly on the shoul-
der with such force th
at Harry was knocked si
deways into a tree. 
"“I knew yeh’d say yes,” said Hagr"
"id into his handkerchief, “but I "
won’ . . . never . . . forget . . . Well 
. . . c’mon . . . jus’ a little bit fur-
ther through here . . . Watch yersel
"ves, now, there’s nettles. . . .” "
They walked on in silence for 
another fifteen minutes. Harry had 
 690 opened his mouth to ask how much 
farther they had to go when Ha-
grid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop. 
"“Really easy,” he said soft"
"ly. “Very quiet, now . . .” "
They crept forward and Harry saw th
"at they were facing a large, "
smooth mound of earth nearly as tall 
"as Hagrid that he thought, with "
"a jolt of dread, was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal. Trees "
had been ripped up at th
e roots all around the mo
"und, so that it stood "
on a bare patch of ground surrounde
d by heaps of trunks and boughs 
that formed a kind of fence or
" barricade, behind which Harry, "
"Hermione, and Ha"
grid now stood. 
"“Sleepin’,” breathed Hagrid. "
"Sure enough, Harry could hear a dist"
"ant, rhythmic rumbling that "
sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work. He glanced sideways 
"at Hermione, who was ga"
zing at the mound with
 her mouth slightly 
open. She looked ut
terly terrified. 
"“Hagrid,” she said in a whisper bare"
ly audible over the sound of the 
"sleeping creature, “who is he?” "
Harry found this an odd question. . . 
. “What is it?” was the one he 
had been planning on asking. 
"“Hagrid, you told us,” said He"
"rmione, her wand now shaking in "
"her hand, “you told us none "
of them wanted to come!” 
Harry looked from her to Hagrid an
"d then, as realization hit him, "
he looked back at the mound 
with a small gasp of horror. 
"The great mound of earth, on "
"which he, Hermione, and Hagrid "
"could easily have stood, was moving "
slowly up and down in time with 
"the deep, grunting breathing. It wa"
s not a mound at all. It was the 
curved back of what
 was clearly . . . 
“Well — no — he didn’ want ter 
"come,” said Hagrid, sounding "
desperate. “But I had ter br
"ing him, Hermione, I had ter!” "
"“But why?” asked Hermione, who "
sounded as though she wanted 
"to cry. “Why — what — oh, "
Hagrid
!” 
"“I knew if I jus’ got him back,” said Hagrid, sounding close to tears "
  691 "himself, “an’ — an’ taught him a few manners — I’d be able ter take "
him outside an’ show ev’ryone he’s harmless!” 
"“Harmless!” said Hermione shrilly, and Hagrid made frantic hush-"
ing noises with his hands as th
e enormous creature before them 
grunted loudly and shifted in its sl
eep. “He’s been hurting you all this 
"time, hasn’t he? That’s why yo"
u’ve had all th
ese injuries!” 
“He don’ know his own strength!” sa
id Hagrid earnestly. “An’ he’s 
"gettin’ better, he’s not figh"
tin’ so much anymore —” 
“So this is why it took you tw
o months to get home!” said 
Hermione distractedly. “Oh Hagrid
", why did you bring him back if "
"he didn’t want to come, wouldn’t he have been happier with his own "
people?” 
"“They were all bullyin’ him, Hermio"
"ne, ’cause he’s so small!” said "
Hagrid. 
“Small?” said Hermione. “
Small
?” 
"“Hermione, I couldn’ leave him,” said Hagrid, tears now trickling "
down his bruised face into his be
ard. “See — he’s my brother!” 
"Hermione simply stared at him, her mouth open. "
"“Hagrid, when you say ‘brother,’"
"” said Harry slowly, “do you "
mean — ?” 
"“Well — half-brother,” amended "
Hagrid. “Turns out me mother 
took up with another giant when she 
"left me dad, an’ she went an’ had "
Grawp here —” 
“Grawp?” said Harry. 
"“Yeah . . . well, tha’s what it soun"
"ds like when he says his name,” "
said Hagrid anxiously. “He don’ spea
k a lot of English.
 . . . I’ve bin 
tryin’ ter teach him. . . . Anyway
", she don’ seem ter have liked him "
"much more’n she liked me. . . . See,"
" with giantesses, what counts is "
"producin’ good big kids, and he’s always been a bit on the runty side "
fer a giant — on’y 
sixteen foot —” 
"“Oh yes, tiny!” said Hermione, with"
 a kind of hysterical sarcasm. 
“Absolutely minuscule!” 
 692 “He was bein’ kicked around by al
l o’ them — I jus’ couldn’ leave 
him —” 
“Did Madame Maxime want to bring him back?” asked Harry. 
"“She — well, she could see it was "
"right importan’ ter me,” said Ha-"
"grid, twisting his enormous hands. “Bu’ — bu’ she got a bit tired of "
"him after a while, I must admit . . . so we split up on the journey "
home. . . . She promised not te
r tell anyone though. . . .” 
“How on earth did you get him 
back without an
yone noticing?” 
said Harry. 
"“Well, tha’s why it took so long"
", see,” said Hagrid. “Could on’y "
travel by nigh an’ through wild coun
"try an’ stuff. ’Course, he covers "
the ground pretty well when he want
"s ter, but he kep’ wantin’ ter go "
back. . . .” 
"“Oh Hagrid, why on earth didn’t"
" you let him!” said Hermione, "
flopping down onto a ripped-up tr
ee and burying her face in her 
hands. “What do you think you’re 
going to do with a violent giant 
who doesn’t even wa
nt to be here!” 
"“Well, now — ‘violent’ — tha’s a bit harsh,” said Hagrid, still "
twisting his hands agitat
edly. “I’ll admit he migh
ta taken a couple o’ 
swings at me when he’s bin in a bad 
"mood, but he’s gettin’ better, loads "
"better, settlin’ do"
wn well. . . .” 
"“What are those ropes for,"
 then?” Harry asked. 
He had just noticed ropes thick as 
saplings stretching from around 
the trunks of the largest nearby 
trees toward the place where Grawp 
lay curled on the ground 
with his back to them. 
“You have to keep him tied 
up?” said Hermione faintly. 
"“Well . . . yeah . . .” said Hagrid, "
looking anxious. “See — it’s like I 
say — he doesn’ really 
know his strength —” 
Harry understood now why there had 
been such a suspicious lack 
of any other living creature 
in this part of the forest. 
“So what is it you want Harry 
and Ron and me to do?” Hermione 
asked apprehensively. 
  693 "“Look after him,” said Hagrid "
croakily. “After
 I’m gone.” 
Harry and Hermione exchanged 
"miserable looks, Harry uncom-"
fortably aware that he 
had already promised Hagrid that he would do 
whatever he asked. 
"“What — what does that involve,"
 exactly?” Hermione inquired. 
“Not food or anythin’!” said Hagr
id eagerly. “He can get his own 
"food, no problem. Birds an’ deer an"
"’ stuff . . . No, it’s company he "
needs. If I jus’ knew someone was ca
rryin’ on tryin’ ter help him a bit 
". . . teachin’ him,"
 yeh know . . .” 
"Harry said nothing, but "
turned to look back 
at the gigantic form 
lying asleep on the ground in front of them. Grawp had his back to 
"them. Unlike Hagrid, who simply looked like a very oversize hu-"
"man, Grawp looked strangely miss"
hapen. What Harry had taken to 
be a vast mossy boulder to the le
ft of the great earthen mound he 
now recognized as Grawp’s head. It 
was much larger in proportion to 
"the body than a human head, almo"
st perfectly round and covered 
"with tightly curling, close-growin"
g hair the color of bracken. The 
"rim of a single large, fleshy ear wa"
s visible on top of
" the head, which "
"seemed to sit, rather like Uncle Vernon’s, directly upon the shoulders "
"with little or no neck in between. The back, under what looked like "
a dirty brownish smock comprised of
 animal skins sewn roughly to-
"gether, was very broad, and as Grawp slept, it seemed to strain a lit-"
tle at the rough seams of the skins. The legs were curled up under 
the body; Harry could see the soles 
"of enormous, filt"
"hy, bare feet, "
"large as sledges, restin"
g one on top of the other on the earthy forest 
floor. 
"“You want us to teach him,” Harry "
said in a hollow voice. He now 
understood what Firenze’s warning had meant. 
His attempt is not work-
ing. He would do better to abandon it.
" Of course, the other creatures "
who lived in the forest would have he
ard Hagrid’s fruitless attempts to 
teach Grawp English. . . . 
"“Yeah — even if yeh jus’ talk ter him a bit,” said Hagrid hopefully. "
 694 "“’Cause I reckon, if he can talk ter "
"people, he’ll understand more that "
we all like him re
"ally, an’ want him "
to stay. . . .” 
"Harry looked at Hermione, who peer"
ed back at him from between 
the fingers over her face. 
“Kind of makes you wish we had No
"rbert back, doesn’t it?” he said "
and she gave a very shaky laugh. 
"“Yeh’ll do it, then?” said Hagrid, "
who did not seem to have caught 
what Harry had just said. 
"“We’ll . . .” said Harry, already "
"bound by his promise. “We’ll try, "
Hagrid. . . .” 
"“I knew I could count on yeh, Harry,” Hagrid said, beaming in a "
very watery way and dabbing at his 
face with his handkerchief again. 
"“An’ I don’ wan’ yeh ter put yerself out too much, like. . . . I know "
yeh’ve got exams. . . . If yeh could jus’ nip down here in yer Invisibil-
ity Cloak maybe once a week an’ have 
a little chat with him . . . I’ll 
"wake him up, then "
— introduce you —” 
"“Wha — no!” said Hermione, ju"
"mping up, “Hagrid, no, don’t "
"wake him, really, "
we don’t need —” 
But Hagrid had already stepped over the great trunk in front of 
them and was proceeding toward 
Grawp. When he was around ten 
"feet away, he lifted a long, broken "
"bough from the ground, smiled re-"
"assuringly over his shoulder at Harry and Hermione, and then poked "
Grawp hard in the middle of the ba
ck with the end 
of the bough. 
The giant gave a roar that echoed 
around the silent forest. Birds in 
the treetops overhead rose twitteri
ng from their perches and soared 
"away. In front of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp "
"was rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed an enor-"
mous hand upon it to push himself 
onto his knees and turned his head 
to see who and what 
had disturbed him. 
"“All righ’, Grawpy?” said Hagrid "
"in a would-be cheery voice, back-"
ing away with the long bough rais
"ed, ready to poke Grawp again. "
"“Had a nice sleep, eh?” "
  695 Harry and Hermione retreated as far 
as they could while still keep-
ing the giant within their sights
. Grawp knelt between two trees he 
had not yet uprooted. They
" looked up into his startlingly huge face, "
which resembled a gray full moon swimming in the gloom of the 
clearing. It was as though the fe
atures had been hewn onto a great 
stone ball. The nose was stubby an
"d shapeless, the mouth lopsided "
and full of misshapen yellow teeth th
e size of half-bricks. The small 
eyes were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were half gummed 
together with sleep. Grawp raised di
rty knuckles as big as cricket balls 
"to his eyes, rubbed vigorously, then, without warning, pushed himself "
to his feet with surprisi
ng speed and agility. 
"“Oh my . . .” Harry heard Hermione squeal, terrified, beside him. "
The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp’s 
wrists and ankles were attached crea
"ked ominously. He was, as Hagrid "
"had said, at least sixteen feet tall. "
"Gazing blearily around, he reached "
out a hand the size of a beach umbrel
"la, seized a bird’s nest from the "
upper branches of a towering pine 
and turned it upside down with a 
roar of apparent displeasure that th
ere was no bird in it — eggs fell 
like grenades toward the ground an
d Hagrid threw his arms over his 
head to protect himself. 
"“Anyway, Grawpy,” shouted Hagrid"
", looking up apprehensively in "
"case of further falling eggs, “I’ve "
brought some friend
s ter meet yeh. 
"Remember, I told yeh I might? Remember, when I said I might have "
ter go on a little trip an’ leave th
em ter look after yeh fer a bit? Re-
"member that, Grawpy?” "
But Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard to say 
whether he was listening to Hagrid 
or whether he even recognized the 
sounds Hagrid was making as speech. He had now seized the top of 
"the pine tree and was pulling it toward him, evidently for the simple "
pleasure of seeing ho
w far it would spring 
back when he let go. 
"“Now, Grawpy, don’ do that!” shouted Hagrid. “Tha’s how you "
ended up pullin’ up the others —” 
 696 "And sure enough, Harry could see the earth around the tree’s roots "
beginning to crack. 
“I got company fer yeh!” Hagrid 
"shouted. “Company, see! Look "
"down, yeh big buffoon, I br"
ought yeh some friends!” 
"“Oh Hagrid, don’t,” moaned Herm"
"ione, but Hagrid had already "
raised the bough again and ga
ve Grawp’s knee 
a sharp poke. 
The giant let go of the top of 
"the pine tree, which swayed menac-"
"ingly and deluged Hagrid with a rain of needles, and looked down. "
“
"This,"
"” said Hagrid, hastening over"
 to where Harry and Hermione 
"stood, “is Harry, Grawp! Harry Potter!"
 He migh’ be comin’ ter visit 
"yeh if I have ter go away, understand?” "
The giant had only just realiz
ed that Harry and Hermione were 
"there. They watched, in great trepid"
"ation, as he lowered his huge boul-"
der of a head so that he co
uld peer blearily at them. 
"“An’ this is Hermione, see? Her "
—” Hagrid hesitated. Turning to 
"Hermione he said, “Would yeh mind"
" if he called yeh Hermy, Hermi-"
one? On’y it’s a difficult name
 fer him ter remember. . . .” 
"“No, not at all,” "
squeaked Hermione. 
"“This is Hermy, Grawp! An’ she’s gonna be comin’ an’ all! Is’n tha’ "
nice? Eh? Two friends fer 
"yeh ter — GRAWPY, NO!” "
Grawp’s hand had shot out of nowhere toward Hermione — Harry 
"seized her and pulled her backward behind the tree, so that Grawp’s "
fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air. 
"“BAD BOY, GRAWPY!” Harry heard "
"Hagrid yelling, as Hermione "
"clung to Harry behind the tree, "
shaking and whimpering. “VERY 
BAD BOY! YEH DON’ GRAB — OUCH!” 
Harry poked his head 
out from around the 
trunk and saw Hagrid 
"lying on his back, his hand over his nose. Grawp, apparently losing in-"
"terest, had straightened up again "
and was again engaged in pulling 
back the pine as fa
r as it would go. 
"“Righ’,” said Hagrid thickly, getti"
ng up with one hand pinching his  
  697 bleeding nose and the other graspi
ng his crossbow. “Well . . . there 
yeh are. . . . Yeh’ve met him an’ — an’ now he’ll know yeh when yeh 
come back. Yeah . 
. . well . . .” 
"He looked up at Grawp, who wa"
s now pulling back the pine with 
an expression of detached pleasure
 on his boulderish face; the roots 
were creaking as he ripped th
em away from the ground. . . . 
"“Well, I reckon tha’s enough fer one day,” said Hagrid. “We’ll — "
"er — we’ll go back now, shall we?” "
Harry and Hermione nodded. Hagr
id shouldered his crossbow 
"again and, still pinching his nose, "
led the way back into the trees. 
"Nobody spoke for a while, not ev"
en when they heard the distant 
crash that meant Grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last. 
Hermione’s face was pale and set.
 Harry could not think of a single 
thing to say. What on earth wa
s going to happen when somebody 
found out that Hagrid had hidden 
Grawp in the forest? And he had 
"promised that he, Ron, and Herm"
ione would continue Hagrid’s to-
"tally pointless attempts to civilize the giant. . . . How could Hagrid, "
even with his immense ca
pacity to delude hims
elf that fanged mon-
"sters were lovably harmless, fool him"
self that Grawp would ever be fit 
to mix with humans? 
"“Hold it,” said Hagrid abruptly"
", just as Harry and Hermione were "
struggling through a patch of thic
k knotgrass behind him. He pulled 
an arrow out of the quiver over his
 shoulder and fitted it into the 
crossbow. Harry and Hermione raised 
their wands; now that they had 
"stopped walking, they"
 too could hear mo
vement close by. 
"“Oh blimey,” said Hagrid quietly. "
"“I thought that we told you, Hagrid,” said a deep male voice, “that "
you are no longer welcome here?” 
A man’s naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating toward 
them through the dappled green half
-light. Then they saw that his 
waist joined smoothly with a horse’
s chestnut body. This centaur had  
 698 "a proud, high-cheekboned face and long black hair. Like Hagrid, he "
was armed: A quiverful of arrows an
d a long bow were slung over his 
shoulders. 
"“How are yeh, Magorian?” said Hagrid warily. "
The trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more emerged 
behind him. Harry recognized th
"e black-bodied and bearded Bane, "
whom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met 
Firenze. Bane gave no sign that he had ever seen Harry before. 
"“So,” he said, with a nasty inflecti"
"on in his voice, before turning "
immediately to Magorian. “We agreed
", I think, what we would do if "
this human showed
 his face in the forest again?” 
"“‘This human’ now, am I?” said Hagr"
id testily. “Jus’ fer stoppin’ all 
of yeh committin’ murder?” 
"“You ought not to have meddled, Hagrid,” said Magorian. “Our "
"ways are not yours, nor are our la"
ws. Firenze has betrayed and dis-
honored us.” 
"“I dunno how yeh work that out,” said Hagrid impatiently. “He’s "
done nothin’ except help
 Albus Dumbledore —” 
“Firenze has entered into servitude 
"to humans,” said a gray centaur "
"with a hard, deeply lined face. "
“
Servitude
!” said Hagrid scathingly. “He’s doin’ Dumbledore a favor 
is all —” 
"“He is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans,” said "
Magorian quietly. “There can be 
no return from such disgrace.” 
"“If yeh say so,” said Hagrid, sh"
"rugging, “but personally I think "
yeh’re makin’ a big mistake —” 
"“As are you, human,” said Bane, “c"
oming back into our forest when 
we warned you —” 
"“Now, you listen ter me,” said Hagrid"
 angrily. “I’ll have less of the 
"‘our’ forest, if it’s all the same ter you. It’s not up ter you who comes "
an’ goes in here —” 
  699 "“No more is it up to you, Hagrid,” said Magorian smoothly. “I shall "
let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young —” 
"“They’re not his!” interrupted Bane contemptuously. “Students, "
"Magorian, from up at the school! Th"
ey have probably already profited 
from the traitor Firenz
e’s teachings. . . .” 
"“Nevertheless,” said Magorian calm"
"ly, “the slaughter of foals is a "
terrible crime. . . . We do not touc
"h the innocent. Today, Hagrid, you "
"pass. Henceforth, stay away from this place. You forfeited the friend-"
ship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor Firenze escape us.” 
“I won’ be kept outta the fores’ by
 a bunch of mules like you!” said 
Hagrid loudly. 
"“Hagrid,” said Hermione in a high-pitched and terrified voice, as "
both Bane and the gray centaur pawed 
"at the ground, “let’s go, please "
lets go! 
"Hagrid moved forward, but his cr"
ossbow was still raised and his 
eyes were still fixed thre
ateningly upon Magorian. 
“We know what you are keeping in
" the forest, Hagr"
id!” Magorian 
"called after them, as the centaurs sl"
ipped out of sight.
 “And our toler-
ance is waning!” 
Hagrid turned and gave every a
ppearance of wanting to walk 
straight back to Magorian again. 
“You’ll tolerate him as long as he’s
" here, it’s as much his forest as "
"yours!” he yelled, while Harry and "
Hermione both pushed with all 
their might against Hagrid’s moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep 
him moving forward. Still scowling
", he looked down; his expression "
changed to mild surprise at the si
ght of them both pushing him. He 
seemed not to have felt it. 
"“Calm down, you two,” he said, tu"
rning to walk on while they 
panted along behind him. “Rud
"dy old nags though, eh?” "
"“Hagrid,” said Hermione breathless"
"ly, skirting the patch of nettles "
they had passed on their way ther
"e, “if the centaurs don’t want  "
 700 "humans in the forest, it doesn’t rea"
lly look as though Harry and I will 
be able —” 
"“Ah, you heard what they said,” said Hagrid dismissively “They "
"wouldn’t hurt foals — I mean, kids. "
"Anyway, we can’ let ourselves be "
pushed around by that lot. . . .” 
"“Nice try,” Harry murmured to Herm"
"ione, who looked crestfallen. "
At last they rejoined the path 
"and after another ten minutes, the "
trees began to thin. They were able
 to see patches of clear blue sky 
"again and hear, in the distance, th"
e definite sounds of cheering and 
shouting. 
“Was that another goal?” asked Ha
"grid, pausing in the shelter of "
the trees as the Quidditch stadium 
came into view. “Or d’you reckon 
the match is over?” 
"“I don’t know,” said Hermione miser"
ably. Harry saw that she looked 
"much the worse for wear; her hair was full of bits of twig and leaves, "
her robes were ripped in several 
places and there were numerous 
scratches on her face and arms. He knew he could look little better. 
"“I reckon it’s over, yeh know!” said Hagrid, still squinting toward "
the stadium. “Look — there’s people
 comin’ out alre
ady — if you two 
hurry yeh’ll be able ter blend in with the crowd an’ no one’ll know you 
weren’t there!” 
"“Good idea,” said Harry. “Well . . . s"
"ee you later, then, Hagrid. . . .” "
"“I don’t believe him,” said Hermione in a very unsteady voice, the "
moment they were out of earshot of
 Hagrid. “I don’t believe him. I 
really
 don’t believe him. . . .” 
"“Calm down,” said Harry. "
“Calm down!” she said feverishly. “A
 giant! A giant in the forest! 
And we’re supposed to give him Engl
"ish lessons! Always assuming, of "
"course, we can get past the herd of"
 murderous centaurs on the way in 
and out! I — don’t — 
believe
 — him!” 
“We haven’t got to do anything yet!” 
Harry tried to reassure her in  
  701 "a quiet voice, as they joined a stre"
am of jabbering Hufflepuffs heading 
back toward the castle. “He’s not 
asking us to do anything unless he 
gets chucked out and that 
might not even happen —” 
"“Oh come off it, Harry!” said Herm"
"ione angrily, stopping dead in "
her tracks so that the people behind her had to swerve to avoid her. 
“Of course he’s going to be chucked 
"out and to be perfectly honest, af-"
"ter what we’ve just seen, "
who can blame Umbridge?” 
There was a pause in which Harry glar
"ed at her, and her eyes filled "
slowly with tears. 
“You didn’t mean
" that,” said Harry quietly. "
"“No . . . well . . . all right . . . I didn’t,” she said, wiping her eyes "
angrily. “But why does he have to ma
ke life so difficult for himself — 
for 
us
?” 
“I dunno —” 
"Weasley is our King, "
"Weasley is our King, "
"He didn’t let the Quaffle in, "
Weasley is our King . . .
"“And I wish they’d stop singing that stupid song,” said Hermione "
"miserably, “haven’t they gloated enough?” "
A great tide of students was moving
 up the sloping lawns from the 
pitch. 
"“Oh, let’s get in before we have to meet the Slytherins,” said "
Hermione. 
"Weasley can save anything, "
He never leaves a single ring 
That’s why Gryffindors all sing: 
Weasley is our King. 
 702 “Hermione . . .” said Harry slowly. 
"The song was growing louder, but it was issuing not from a crowd "
"of green-and-silver-clad Slytherins, "
but from a mass of red and gold 
"moving slowly toward the castle, "
which was bearing a solitary figure 
upon its many shoulders. . . . 
"Weasley is our King, "
"Weasley is our King, "
"He didn’t let the Quaffle in, "
Weasley is our King . . .
“No!” said Hermione in a hushed voice. 
“YES!” said Harry loudly. 
"“HARRY! HERMIONE!” yelled Ron,"
 waving the silver Quidditch 
Cup in the air and looking quite beside himself. “WE DID IT! WE 
WON!” 
They beamed up at him as he pa
ssed; there was a scrum at the door 
of the castle and Ron’s head got rath
"er badly bumped on the lintel, but "
"nobody seemed to want to put him down. Still singing, the crowd "
squeezed itself into the entrance 
hall and out of sight. Harry and 
"Hermione watched them go, beaming, until the last echoing strains of "
"“Weasley Is Our King” died away. Then they turned to each other, "
their smiles fading. 
"“We’ll save our news till tomorrow, shall we?” said Harry. "
"“Yes, all right,” said Hermione wear"
ily. “I’m not in any hurry. . . .” 
They climbed the steps together. 
At the front doors both instinc-
tively looked back at the Forb
idden Forest. Harry was not sure 
whether it was his imagination or no
"t, but he rather thought he saw a "
small cloud of birds erupting into th
e air over the treetops in the dis-
"tance, almost as though the tree in"
 which they had been nesting had 
just been pulled up by the roots. 
Ron’s euphoria at helping Gryffi
ndor scrape the Quidditch Cup 
was such that he could not settle
 to anything next day. All he 
wanted to do was talk over the match and Harry and Hermione found 
it very difficult to find an opening
 in which to mention Grawp — not 
that either of them tried very hard; 
neither was keen to be the one to 
bring Ron back to reality in quite su
ch a brutal fashio
n. As it was an-
"other fine, warm day, they persuade"
d him to join them in studying 
under the beech tree on the edge of
" the lake, where they stood less "
chance of being overheard than 
in the common room. Ron was not 
particularly keen on this idea at fi
rst; he was thoroughly enjoying be-
ing patted on the back by Gryffin
"dors walking past his chair, not to "
"mention the occasional outbursts of “Weasley Is Our King,” but "
agreed after a while that some
 fresh air might do him good. 
They spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat 
down while Ron talked them through 
his first save of the match for 
what felt like the dozenth time. 
"“Well, I mean, I’d already let in that"
" one of Davies’s, so I wasn’t feel-"
"ing that confident, but I dunno, wh"
"en Bradley came toward me, just "
R 
 704 "out of nowhere, I thought — "
you can do this
! And I had about a sec-
"ond to decide which way to fly, yo"
"u know, because he looked like he "
was aiming for the right goal hoop 
"— my right, obviously, his left — "
but I had a funny feeling that he 
"was feinting, and so I took the "
chance and flew left 
"— his right, I mean — and — well — you saw "
"what happened,” he conc"
"luded modestly, sweeping his hair back quite "
unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing 
around to see whether the people 
nearest to them — a bunch of gos-
"siping third-year Hufflepuffs — had heard him. “And then, when "
Chambers came at me about five 
"minutes later — what?” Ron said, "
stopping mid-sentence at
 the look on Harry’s face. “Why are you 
grinning?” 
"“I’m not,” said Harry quickly, l"
ooking down at his Transfiguration 
notes and attempting to straighten
 his face. The truth was that Ron 
had just reminded Harry forcibly 
of another Gryffindor Quidditch 
player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree. “I’m 
"just glad we won, that’s all.” "
"“Yeah,” said Ron slowly, savoring the words, “"
we won.
 Did you see 
the look on Chang’s face when Ginny
 got the Snitch right out from 
under her nose?” 
"“I suppose she cried, did "
she?” said Harry bitterly. 
"“Well, yeah — more out of temper than anything, though . . .” "
Ron frowned slightly. “But you sa
w her chuck her broom away when 
"she got back to the ground, didn’t you?” "
“Er —” said Harry. 
"“Well, actually . . . no, Ron,” said Hermione with a heavy sigh, "
putting down her book and looking 
at him apologetic
ally. “As a mat-
"ter of fact, the only bit of the ma"
tch Harry and I saw wa
s Davies’s first 
goal.” 
Ron’s carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment. 
“You didn’t watch?” he said faintly
", looking from one to the other. "
“You didn’t see me make
 any of those saves?” 
   705 "“Well — no,” said Hermione, stre"
tching out a placatory hand to-
"ward him. “But Ron, we didn’t"
 want to leave — we had to!” 
"“Yeah?” said Ron, whose face was growing rather red. “How come?” "
"“It was Hagrid,” said Harry. “He de"
cided to tell us why he’s been 
covered in injuries ever since he go
t back from the giants. He wanted 
"us to go into the forest with him, we had no choice, you know how he "
gets. . . . Anyway . . .” 
The story was told in 
"five minutes, by the "
end of which Ron’s in-
dignation had been replaced by 
a look of total incredulity. 
“
He brought one back and hid it in the forest
?” 
"“Yep,” said Harry grimly. "
"“No,” said Ron, as though by saying this he could make it untrue. "
"“No, he can’t have. . . .” "
"“Well, he has,” said Hermione fi"
rmly. “Grawp’s about sixteen feet 
"tall, enjoys ripping up twenty-foot pine trees, and knows me,” she "
"snorted, “as "
Hermy.
” 
Ron gave a nervous laugh. 
“And Hagrid wants us to . . . ?” 
"“Teach him English, yeah,” said Harry. "
"“He’s lost his mind,” said Ro"
n in an almost
 awed voice. 
"“Yes,” said Hermione irri"
"tably, turning a page of "
Intermediate 
Transfiguration
 and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl 
turning into a pair of opera glasses. 
"“Yes, I’m starting to think he has. "
"But unfortunately, he made"
 Harry and me promise.” 
"“Well, you’re just going to have to break your promise, that’s all,” "
"said Ron firmly. “I mean, come on . . . We’ve got exams and we’re "
"about that far,” he held up his ha"
nd to show thumb and forefinger a 
"millimeter apart, “from being chucked "
out as it is. And anyway . . . re-
member Norbert? Remember Aragog? 
Have we ever come off better 
for mixing with any of 
Hagrid’s monster mates?” 
"“I know, it’s just that — we promised,” said Hermione in a small "
voice. 
 706 Ron smoothed his hair flat ag
"ain, looking preoccupied. "
"“Well,” he sighed, “Hagrid hasn’t "
"been sacked yet, has he? He’s "
"hung on this long, mayb"
e he’ll hang on till th
e end of term and we 
won’t have to go near Grawp at all.” 
The castle grounds were gleaming in
 the sunlight as though freshly 
painted; the cloudless sky smiled at
 itself in the smoothly sparkling 
"lake, the satin-green lawns rippled occa"
sionally in a gent
le breeze: June 
"had arrived, but to the fifth years "
this meant only one thing: Their 
O.W.L.s were upon
 them at last. 
Their teachers were no longer 
setting them ho
mework; lessons 
were devoted to reviewing those topics their teachers thought most 
"likely to come up in the exams. The purposeful, feverish atmosphere "
"drove nearly everything but the O.W.L.s from Harry’s mind, though "
he did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had 
ever told Snape that he must 
continue giving Harry Occlumency 
"tuition: If he had, then Snape had "
ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he 
was now ignoring Harry. This su
ited Harry very well; he was quite 
busy and tense enough without extra cl
"asses with Snape, and to his re-"
lief Hermione was much too preoccu
pied these days to badger him 
about Occlumency. She was spending 
a lot of time muttering to her-
self and had not laid out any elf clothes for days. 
She was not the only person ac
ting oddly as the O.W.L.s drew 
steadily nearer. Ernie Macmillan had 
developed an irritating habit of 
interrogating people ab
out their study habits. 
“How many hours d’you think you’
re doing a day?” he demanded 
of Harry and Ron as they queued 
"outside Herbology, a manic gleam "
in his eyes. 
"“I dunno,” said Ron. “A few . . .” "
“More or less than eight?” 
"“Less, I s’pose,” said Ron,"
 looking slightly alarmed. 
"“I’m doing eight,” said Ernie, puff"
ing out his chest. “Eight or nine. 
   707 I’m getting an hour in before breakf
ast every day. Eight’s my average. 
I can do ten on a good weekend day.
 I did nine and a half on Monday. 
Not so good on Tuesday — only seven and a quarter. Then on 
Wednesday —” 
Harry was deeply thankful that Pro
fessor Sprout ushered them into 
"greenhouse three at that point, forcing Ernie to abandon his recital. "
Meanwhile Draco Malfoy had foun
d a different way to induce 
panic. 
"“Of course, it’s not what you know"
",” he was heard to tell Crabbe "
and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few
 days before the exams were to 
"start, “it’s who you know. Now, Father"
’s been friendly with the head of 
the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years — old Griselda 
Marchbanks — we’ve had her round fo
r dinner and everything. . . .” 
“Do you think that’s true?” 
Hermione whispered to Harry and 
"Ron, looking frightened. "
“Nothing we can do about it if
" it is,” said Ron gloomily. "
"“I don’t think it’s true,” said Neville quietly from behind them. "
“Because Griselda Marchbanks is a fr
"iend of my gran’s, and she’s never "
mentioned the Malfoys.” 
"“What’s she like, Neville?” asked He"
rmione at once. “Is she strict?” 
"“Bit like Gran, really,” said"
 Neville in a subdued voice. 
“Knowing her won’t hurt
" your chances though, will it?” Ron told "
him encouragingly. 
"“Oh, I don’t think it will make any di"
"fference,” said Neville, still more "
miserably. “Gran’s always telling Professor Marchbanks I’m not as good 
as my dad. . . . Well . . . you saw what
 she’s like at St. Mungo’s. . . .” 
Neville looked fixedly at the 
"floor. Harry, Ron, and Hermione "
"glanced at one another, but didn’t kn"
ow what to say. It was the first 
time that Neville had ac
knowledged that they 
had met at the Wizard-
ing hospital. 
Meanwhile a flourishing black-mark
et trade in aids to concentra-
"tion, mental agility, "
and wakefulness had spru
ng up among the fifth 
 708 and seventh years. Harry and Ron we
re much tempted by the bottle 
of Baruffio’s Brain Elixir offered to
 them by Ravenclaw sixth year Ed-
"die Carmichael, who swore it was "
solely responsible for the nine 
“Outstanding” O.W.L.s he had gai
ned the previous summer and was 
offering the whole pint for a mere 
twelve Galleons. Ron assured Harry 
he would reimburse him 
for his half the moment he left Hogwarts 
"and got a job, but before they "
"could close the deal, Hermione had "
confiscated the bottle 
from Carmichael and poured the contents 
down a toilet. 
"“Hermione, we wanted to buy that!” shouted Ron. "
"“Don’t be stupid,” she snarled. “You might as well take Harold "
Dingle’s powdered dragon claw
 and have done
 with it.” 
“Dingle’s got powdered dragon
 claw?” said Ron eagerly. 
"“Not anymore,” said Hermione. “I"
 confiscated that too. None of 
these things actually
 works you know —” 
“Dragon claw does work!” said Ron. 
"“It’s supposed to be incredible, "
"really gives your brain a boost, yo"
u come over all cunning for a few 
"hours — Hermione, let me have a pi"
"nch, go on, it can’t hurt —” "
"“This stuff can,” said Hermione gr"
"imly. “I’ve had a look at it, and "
it’s actually drie
d doxy droppings.” 
This information took the edge of
f Harry and Ron’s desire for brain 
stimulants. 
They received their examination sc
hedules and details of the proce-
dure for O.W.L.s duri
ng their next Transfiguration lesson. 
"“As you can see,” Professor McGona"
gall told the class while they 
copied down the dates and times of 
their exams from 
"the blackboard, "
“your O.W.L.s are spread over two 
successive weeks. You will sit the 
theory exams in the morn
ings and the practice
 in the afternoons. 
"Your practical Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at "
night. 
"“Now, I must warn you that the most stringent Anti-Cheating "
Charms have been applied to your
 examination papers. Auto-Answer 
   709 Quills are banned from
" the examination hall, "
"as are Remembralls, "
"Detachable Cribbing Cuffs, and Self"
"-Correcting Ink. Every year, I am "
"afraid to say, seems to harbor at "
least one student who thinks that he 
or she can get around the Wizardin
g Examinations Au
thority’s rules. 
I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor. Our new — head-
mistress” — Professor McGonagall 
pronounced the word with the 
same look on her face that Aunt
 Petunia had whenever she was con-
templating a particularly stubborn 
bit of dirt — “has asked the Heads 
of House to tell their students that 
cheating will be punished most se-
"verely — because, of course, your"
 examination results will reflect 
upon the headmistress’s new regime at the school. . . .” 
Professor McGonagall gave a tiny 
sigh. Harry saw the nostrils of 
her sharp nose flare. 
"“However, that is no reason not to do your very best. You have your "
own futures to think about.” 
"“Please, Professor,” said Hermione, "
"her hand in the air, “when will "
we find out our results?” 
“An owl will be sent to you some
" time in July,” said Professor "
McGonagall. 
"“Excellent,” said Dean Thomas in "
"an audible whisper, “so we don’t "
have to worry about it till the holidays. . . .” 
Harry imagined sitting in his bedroo
m in Privet Drive in six weeks’ 
"time, waiting for his O.W.L. results"
". Well, he thought, at least he "
would be sure of one bit of
 post next summer. . . . 
"Their first exam, Theory of Charms, was scheduled for Monday "
morning. Harry agreed to test He
rmione after lunch on Sunday but 
regretted it almost at once. She wa
s very agitated and kept snatching 
the book back from him to check 
that she had gotten the answer com-
"pletely right, finally hi"
tting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge 
of 
Achievements in Charming.
“Why don’t you just do it yourself
"?” he said firmly, handing the "
"book back to her, his eyes watering. "
 710 Meanwhile Ron was reading two years of Charms notes with his 
"fingers in his ears, his lips moving "
soundlessly; Seamus was lying flat 
on his back on the fl
"oor, reciting the definition of a Substantive "
"Charm, while Dean checked it against "
"The Standard Book of Spells, "
Grade 5
"; and Parvati and Lavender, who "
were practicing basic loco-
"motion charms, were making their p"
encil cases race each other around 
the edge of the table. 
Dinner was a subdued affair that 
night. Harry and Ron did not talk 
"much, but ate with gusto, having st"
udied hard all day. Hermione on 
the other hand kept putting down he
r knife and fork and diving un-
"der the table for her bag, from whic"
h she would seize a book to check 
some fact or figure. Ron was just te
lling her that she ought to eat a de-
cent meal or she would not sleep th
"at night, when her fork slid from "
her limp fingers and landed with
 a loud tinkle 
on her plate. 
"“Oh, my goodness,” she said faintly"
", staring into th"
e entrance hall. 
“Is that them? Is th
at the examiners?” 
Harry and Ron whipped around on
 their bench. Through the 
doors to the Great Hall they could 
see Umbridge standing with a 
small group of ancient-looking 
"witches and wizards. Umbridge, "
"Harry was pleased to see, looked rather nervous. "
“Shall we go and have a 
closer look?” said Ron. 
Harry and Hermione nodded and th
ey hastened toward the double 
"doors into the entrance hall, slowin"
g down as they stepped over the 
threshold to walk sedately past 
the examiners. Harry thought Profes-
"sor Marchbanks must be the tiny, stoop"
ed witch with a face so lined it 
looked as though it 
had been draped in cobwebs; Umbridge was 
speaking to her very deferentially. Pr
ofessor Marchbanks
 seemed to be 
a little deaf; she was answering Umbr
idge very loudly 
considering that 
they were only a foot apart. 
"“Journey was fine, journey was fine, we’ve made it plenty of times "
before!” she said impatiently. “Now
", I haven’t heard from Dumbledore "
"lately!” she added, peering around th"
e hall as though hopeful he might 
   711 "suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard. “No idea where he is, I "
suppose?” 
"“None at all,” said Umbridge, shoo"
"ting a malevolent look at Harry, "
"Ron, and Hermione, who were now "
dawdling around the foot of 
the stairs as Ron pretended to do 
up his shoelace. “But I daresay the 
Ministry of Magic will track 
him down soon enough. . . .” 
"“I doubt it,” shouted tiny Profe"
"ssor Marchbanks, “not if Dumble-"
dore doesn’t want to be found! I 
should know. . . . Examined him 
personally in Transfiguration and 
Charms when he did N.E.W.T.s . . . 
Did things with a wand I’d never seen before . . .” 
“Yes . . . well . . .” said Pro
"fessor Umbridge as Harry, Ron, and "
Hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they 
"dared, “let me show you to the staffroom . . . I daresay you’d like a cup "
of tea after your journey. . . .” 
It was an uncomfortable sort of an
 evening. Everyone was trying to 
do some last-minute studying but nobody seemed to be getting very 
far. Harry went to bed early but th
en lay awake for what felt like 
hours. He remembered his careers consultation and McGonagall’s fu-
rious declaration that she would help
 him become an Auror if it was 
the last thing she did. . . . He wished he had expressed a more achiev-
able ambition now that exam time was here. . . . He knew that he was 
not the only one lying aw
"ake, but none of the ot"
hers in the dormitory 
"spoke and finally, one by "
"one, they fell asleep. "
None of the fifth years talked very
 much at breakfast next day ei-
ther. Parvati was practicing incant
ations under her breath while the 
salt cellar in front of her tw
"itched, Hermione was rereading "
Achieve-
ment in Charming
 so fast that her eyes a
"ppeared blurred, and Neville "
kept dropping his knife and fork 
and knocking over the marmalade. 
"Once breakfast was over, the fifth and seventh years milled around "
in the entrance hall while the other 
"students went off to lessons. Then, "
"at half-past nine, they were called "
forward class by class to reenter the 
"Great Hall, which was now arranged"
 exactly as Harry had seen it in 
 712 "the Pensieve when his father, Sirius"
", and Snape had been taking their "
O.W.L.s. The four House tables 
had been removed and replaced in-
"stead with many tables for one, al"
l facing the staff-table end of the 
Hall where Professor Mc
Gonagall stood facing th
em. When they were 
"all seated and quiet she said, “You"
" may begin,” and turned over an "
enormous hourglass on the desk beside
" her, on which were also spare "
"quills, ink bottles, an"
d rolls of parchment. 
"Harry turned over his paper, his heart thumping hard. . . . Three "
rows to his right and four seats 
"ahead, Hermione was already scrib-"
bling. . . . He lowered his 
eyes to the first question: 
a) Give the incanta-
"tion, and b) describe the wand movement required to make objects fly. . . ."
Harry had a fleeting memory of a cl
ub soaring high into the air and 
landing loudly on the thick skull of 
"a troll. . . . Smiling slightly, he "
bent over the paper and 
began to write. . . . 
"“Well, it wasn’t too bad, was it?”"
 asked Hermione anxiously in the en-
"trance hall two hours later, still "
clutching the exam paper. “I’m not 
sure I did myself justice on Chee
"ring Charms, I just ran out of "
time — did you put in the countercharm for hiccups? I wasn’t sure 
"whether I ought to, it felt like too much — and on question twenty-"
three —” 
"“Hermione,” said Ron sternly, “we’"
ve been through this before. . . . 
We’re not going through every exam 
"afterward, it’s bad enough doing "
them once.” 
The fifth years ate lunch with the re
st of the school (the four House 
tables reappeared over the lunch hour) and then trooped off into the 
"small chamber beside the Great Hall, where they were to wait until "
called for their practical examinatio
n. As small groups of students 
were called forward in alphabetical 
"order, those left behind muttered "
incantations and practiced wand mo
"vements, occasionally poking one "
another in the back or eye by mistake. 
Hermione’s name was called. Trembl
"ing, she left the chamber with "
   713 "Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle, and Daphne Greengrass. Stu-"
"dents who had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry "
and Ron had no idea ho
w Hermione had done. 
“She’ll be fine — remember she go
t a hundred and twelve percent 
on one of our Charms tests?” said Ron. 
"Ten minutes later, Professor Flit"
"wick called, “Parkinson, Pansy — "
"Patil, Padma — Patil, Pa"
"rvati — Potter, Harry.” "
"“Good luck,” said Ron quietly. Ha"
"rry walked into the Great Hall, "
clutching his wand so ti
ghtly his hand shook. 
"“Professor Tofty is free, Potter,” squeaked Professor Flitwick, who "
was standing just inside the door
. He pointed Harry
 toward what 
looked like the very ol
"dest and baldest examiner, who was sitting be-"
hind a small table in a 
"far corner, a short distance from Professor "
"Marchbanks, who was halfway through testing Draco Malfoy. "
"“Potter, is it?” said "
"Professor Tofty, consulti"
ng his notes and peering 
over his pince-nez at Harry as he 
approached. “The famous Potter?” 
"Out of the corner of his eye, Ha"
rry distinctly saw Malfoy throw a 
scathing look over at him; the wine 
glass Malfoy had been levitating 
fell to the floor and smashed. Harr
y could not suppress a grin. Profes-
sor Tofty smiled back 
at him encouragingly. 
"“That’s it,” he said in his quave"
"ry old voice, “no need"
 to be nervous. 
". . . Now, if I could ask you to take"
 this eggcup and make it do some 
cartwheels for me. . . .” 
On the whole Harry thought it went
 rather well; his Levitation 
Charm was certainly much better th
"an Malfoy’s had been, though he "
wished he had not mixed up the in
cantations for Co
lor-Change and 
"Growth Charms, so that the rat he "
was supposed to be turning orange 
swelled shockingly and was the size
 of a badger before Harry could 
rectify his mistake. He was glad He
rmione had not been in the Hall at 
the time and neglected to mention it to her afterward. He could tell 
"Ron, though; Ron had caused a dinner"
 plate to mutate into a large 
mushroom and had no idea
 how it had happened. 
 714 There was no time to relax that ni
ght — they went straight to the 
common room after dinner and submerged themselves in studying for 
Transfiguration next day. Harry went
" to bed, his he"
ad buzzing with 
complex spell models and theories. 
He forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his written 
"exam next morning, but thought his practical could have been a lot "
worse. At least he managed to vani
"sh the whole of his iguana, whereas "
poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and 
somehow managed to multiply her fe
"rret into a flock of flamingos, "
causing the examination to be halt
ed for ten minutes while the birds 
were captured and carr
ied out of the Hall. 
They had their Herbology exam on
 Wednesday (other than a small 
"bite from a Fanged Geranium, Harr"
y felt he had do
ne reasonably 
"well) and then, on Thur"
"sday, Defense Against the Dark Arts. Here, for "
"the first time, Harry felt sure he ha"
d passed. He had no problem with 
any of the written questions and took
" particular pleasure, during the "
"practical examination, in performi"
ng all the counterjinxes and defen-
"sive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from "
near the doors into 
the entrance hall. 
"“Oh bravo!” cried Professor Tofty,"
" who was examining Harry again, "
when Harry demonstrated a perfect 
boggart banishing spell. “Very 
"good indeed! Well, I think that’s al"
"l, Potter . . . "
unless . . .” 
He leaned forward a little. 
"“I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can pro-"
duce a Patronus? For a 
bonus point . . . ?” 
"Harry raised his wand, looked dire"
"ctly at Umbridge, and imagined "
her being sacked. 
“
Expecto Patronum
!” 
The silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the 
length of the hall. All of the exam
iners looked around to watch its 
progress and when it dissolved into
" silver mist, Professor Tofty "
clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically. 
   715 “Excellent!” he said. “Very 
"well, Potter, you may go!” "
As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door their eyes met. There 
"was a nasty smile playing around her wide, slack mouth, but he did "
not care. Unless he was very much mi
staken (and he was not planning 
"on saying it to anybody, in case he was), he had just achieved an “Out-"
standing” O.W.L. 
"On Friday, Harry and Ron had "
a day off while Hermione sat 
"her Ancient Runes exam, and as they had the whole weekend in front "
"of them, they permitted themselv"
es a break from studying. They 
stretched and yawned beside the 
"open window, through which warm "
summer air wafted over them as they
 played a desultory game of wiz-
"ard chess. Harry could see Hagrid in the distance, teaching a class on "
the edge of the forest. He was trying
 to guess what creatures they were 
examining — he thought it must 
"be unicorns, because the boys "
seemed to be standing 
back a little — when the 
portrait hole opened 
"and Hermione clambered in, looking thoroughly bad tempered. "
“How were the runes?” said 
"Ron, yawning and stretching. "
"“I mistranslated ‘ehwaz,’” said He"
rmione furiously. “It means ‘part-
"nership,’ not ‘defense,’ I mi"
xed it up with ‘eihwaz.’” 
"“Ah well,” said Ron lazily, “that’s "
"only one mistake, isn’t it, you’ll "
still get —” 
"“Oh shut up,” said Hermione angril"
"y, “it could be the one mistake "
that makes the difference between 
"a pass and a fail. And what’s more, "
"someone’s put another niffler in Umbridge’s office, I don’t know how "
"they got it through that new door, "
but I just walked
 past there and 
Umbridge is shrieking her head off 
"— by the sound of it, it tried to "
take a chunk out of her leg —” 
"“Good,” said Harry and Ron together. "
“It is 
not
 good!” said Hermione hotly. “She thinks it’s Hagrid doing 
"it, remember? And we do "
not 
want Hagrid chucked out!” 
"“He’s teaching at the moment, sh"
"e can’t blame him,” said Harry, "
gesturing out of the window. 
 716 "“Oh, you’re so "
naive
" sometimes, Harry, you "
really thin
k Umbridge 
will wait for proof?” said Hermione
", who seemed determined to be in "
"a towering temper, and "
"she swept off toward the girls’ dormitories, "
banging the door behind her. 
"“Such a lovely, sweet-tempered girl"
",” said Ron, very quietly, prod-"
ding his queen forward so that sh
e could begin beating up one of 
Harry’s knights. 
Hermione’s bad mood persisted fo
"r most of the weekend, though "
Harry and Ron found it quite easy to
 ignore as they spent most of 
Saturday and Sunday studying for 
"Potions on Monday, the exam to "
which Harry was looking forward le
ast and which he was sure would 
be the one that would be the downfall
 of his ambitions to become an 
"Auror. Sure enough, he found the wr"
"itten exam difficult, though he "
thought he might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice 
Potion: He could describe its effec
"ts extremely accurately, having "
taken it illegally in his second year. 
The afternoon practical was not as dr
eadful as he had expected it to 
be. With Snape absent from the proceedings he found that he was 
much more relaxed than he usually 
"was while making potions. Neville, "
"who was sitting very near Harry, al"
so looked happier than Harry had 
ever seen him during a Potions cl
ass. When Professor Marchbanks 
"said, “Step away from your cauldrons,"
" please, the examination is over,” "
Harry corked his sample flask feeling 
that he might not have achieved 
"a good grade but that he had,"
" with luck, av"
oided a fail. 
"“Only four exams left,” said Parvati Patil wearily as they headed "
back to Gryffindor common room. 
“Only!” said Hermione snappishly. 
“I’ve
 got Arithmancy and it’s 
probably the toughest subject there is!” 
Nobody was foolish enough to snap 
"back, so she was "
unable to vent 
her spleen on any of them and was 
reduced to telling off some first 
years for giggling too loud
ly in the common room. 
   717 Harry was determined to perform we
ll in Tuesday’s Care of Magi-
cal Creatures exam so as not to le
t Hagrid down. The practical exam-
ination took place in the afternoon 
on the lawn on the edge of the 
"Forbidden Forest, where students were"
 required to correctly identify 
the knarl hidden among a dozen hedg
ehogs (the trick was to offer 
"them all milk in turn: knarls, highly"
 suspicious creatures whose quills 
"had many magical properties, generall"
y went berserk at what they saw 
as an attempt to poison them); th
en demonstrate correct handling of 
"a bowtruckle, feed and clean a fire"
-crab without sustaining serious 
"burns, and choose, from a wide selection of food, the diet they would "
give a sick unicorn. 
Harry could see Hagrid watching 
anxiously out of his cabin win-
"dow. When Harry’s examiner, a plump litt"
"le witch this time, smiled at "
him and told him he could leav
"e, Harry gave Hagrid a fleeting "
thumbs-up before heading 
back up to the castle. 
The Astronomy theory exam on 
Wednesday morning went well 
enough; Harry was not convinced he had got the names of all of 
"Jupiter’s moons right, but was at least confident that none of them was "
inhabited by mice. They had to wait
 until evening for their practical 
Astronomy; the afternoon was devoted instead to Divination. 
Even by Harry’s low standards in 
"Divination, the exam went very "
badly. He might as well have tried to
 see moving pictures in the desk-
top as in the stubbornly blank crysta
l ball; he lost his head completely 
"during tea-leaf reading, saying it "
looked to him as though Professor 
Marchbanks would shortly be meetin
"g a round, dark, soggy stranger, "
and rounded off the whole fiasco by 
mixing up the life and head lines 
on her palm and informing her that 
she ought to have died the previ-
ous Tuesday. 
"“Well, we were always going to fail that one,” said Ron gloomily as "
they ascended the marb
le staircase. He had 
just made Harry feel 
rather better by telling him how he told the examiner in detail about  
 718 the ugly man with a wart on his nose
" in his crystal ball, only to look "
up and realize he had 
been describing his examiner’s reflection. 
“We shouldn’t have taken the stupid 
"subject in the first place,” said "
Harry. 
"“Still, at least we can give it up now.” "
"“Yeah,” said Harry. “No more pr"
etending we care what happens 
when Jupiter and Uranus 
get too friendly . . .” 
"“And from now on, I don’t ca"
re if my tea leaves spell 
"die, Ron, die"
 — 
I’m just chucking them in 
the bin where they belong.” 
Harry laughed just as Hermione 
came running up behind them. 
He stopped laughing
" at once, in case"
 it annoyed her. 
"“Well, I think I’ve done all righ"
"t in Arithmancy,” she said, and "
Harry and Ron both sighed with reli
ef. “Just time for a quick look 
over our star charts befo
"re dinner, then . . .” "
When they reached the top of th
e Astronomy Tower at eleven 
o’clock they found a perfect night fo
"r stargazing, clou"
dless and still. 
"The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight, and there was a slight "
chill in the air. Each of them set 
"up his or her telescope and, when "
Professor Marchbanks gave the word
", proceeded to fill in the blank "
star chart he or she had been given. 
Professors Marchbanks and Toft
"y strolled among them, watching "
as they entered the precise positions 
of the stars and planets they were 
observing. All was quiet except for 
"the rustle of parchment, the occa-"
"sional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand, and the scrib-"
bling of many quills. Half an hour
" passed, then an hour; the little "
squares of reflected gold light flickering on the ground below started 
to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished. 
As Harry completed the constellatio
"n Orion on his chart, however, "
the front doors of the castle opene
d directly below the parapet where 
"he was standing, so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way "
across the lawn. Harry glanced down as
 he made a slight adjustment  
   719 to the position of his telescope an
d saw five or six elongated shadows 
moving over the brightly lit grass 
before the doors swung shut and the 
lawn became a sea of darkness once more. 
Harry put his eye back 
to his telescope and 
"refocused it, now ex-"
amining Venus. He looked down at hi
"s chart to enter the planet there, "
but something distracted him. Pausin
g with his quill suspended over 
"the parchment, he squinted down in"
to the shadowy grounds and saw 
half a dozen figures walking over th
e lawn. If they had not been mov-
"ing, and the moonlight had not been "
gilding the tops 
"of their heads, "
they would have been indistinguis
hable from the dark ground on 
which they stood. Even at this di
"stance, Harry had a funny feeling "
that he recognized the walk of th
"e squattest among them, who seemed "
to be leading the group. 
He could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll outside 
"past midnight, much less accompan"
ied by five others. Then some-
"body coughed behind him, and he re"
membered that he was halfway 
through an exam. He had quite fo
rgotten Venus’s position — jam-
"ming his eye to his telescope, he "
found it again and was again on the 
point of entering it on his chart 
"when, alert for any odd sound, he "
heard a distant knock that echoed 
"through the deserted grounds, fol-"
lowed immediately by the muff
led barking of a large dog. 
"He looked up, his heart hammering. There were lights on in Ha-"
grid’s windows and the people he ha
d observed crossing the lawn were 
now silhouetted against them. The 
door opened and he distinctly saw 
six tiny but sharply defined figures 
walk over the threshold. The door 
closed again and there was silence. 
Harry felt very uneasy. He glanced around to see whether Ron or 
"Hermione had noticed what he had,"
 but Professor Marchbanks came 
walking behind him at that moment
", and not wanting to appear as "
though he was sneaking 
looks at anyone else’s 
"work, he hastily bent "
over his star chart and pretended to be
 adding notes to it while really  
 720 peering over the top of the parapet to
ward Hagrid’s cabi
n. Figures were 
"now moving across the cabin windows,"
 temporarily blocking the light. 
He could feel Professor Marchbanks
’s eyes on the back of his neck 
"and pressed his eye again to his telescope, staring up at the moon "
though he had marked its position
" an hour ago, but as Professor "
Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that 
echoed through the darkness right to
 the top of the 
Astronomy Tower. 
Several of the people around Ha
rry ducked out from behind their 
telescopes and peered 
instead in the direction of Hagrid’s cabin. 
Professor Tofty gave anot
her dry little cough. 
"“Try and concentrate, now, boys"
" and girls,” he said softly. "
Most people returned to their tele
scopes. Harry looked to his left. 
Hermione was gazing tr
ansfixed at Hagrid’s. 
“Ahem — twenty minutes to go
",” said Professor Tofty. "
Hermione jumped and returned at once to her star chart; Harry 
looked down at his own and noticed 
that he had mislabelled Venus as 
Mars. He bent to correct it. 
There was a loud 
BANG 
from the grounds. Several people said 
“Ouch!” as they poked themselves in
 the face with the ends of their 
"telescopes, hastening to see what was going on below. "
Hagrid’s door had burst open and by
 the light flooding out of the 
"cabin they saw him quite clearly, a massive figure roaring and bran-"
"dishing his fists, surrounded by si"
"x people, all of "
"whom, judging by "
the tiny threads of red light they we
"re casting in his direction, seemed "
to be attempting to Stun him. 
“No!” cried Hermione. 
“My dear!” said Professor Tofty in 
a scandalized voice. “This is an 
examination!” 
But nobody was paying the slightes
t attention to their star charts 
anymore: Jets of red light were sti
"ll flying beside Hagrid’s cabin, yet "
somehow they seemed to be bouncing
 off him. He was still upright  
   721 "and still, as far as Harry could see, fighting. Cries and yells echoed "
"across the grounds; a man yelled, “B"
"e reasonable, Hagrid!” and Hagrid "
"roared, “Reasonable be damned, yeh wo"
"n’ take me like this, Dawlish!” "
Harry could see the tiny outline of
" Fang, attempting"
 to defend Ha-
"grid, leaping at the wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell "
"caught him and he fell to the ground. Hagrid gave a howl of fury, "
lifted the culprit bodily from th
"e ground, and threw him: The man "
flew what looked like ten feet 
and did not get up again. Hermione 
"gasped, both hands over her mouth;"
 Harry looked around at Ron and 
saw that he too was looking scared
. None of them had ever seen Ha-
grid in a real te
mper before. . . . 
"“Look!” squealed Parvati, who wa"
s leaning over the parapet and 
pointing to the foot of the castle 
where the front doors seemed to have 
opened again; more light had spilled out onto the dark lawn and a sin-
gle long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn. 
"“Now, really!” said Professor To"
fty anxiously. “Only sixteen min-
"utes left, you know!” "
But nobody paid him the slightes
t attention: They were watching 
the person now sprinting toward th
e battle beside Hagrid’s cabin. 
“How dare you!” the figure shouted as she ran. “How 
dare
 you!” 
“It’s McGonagall!” 
whispered Hermione. 
“Leave him alone! 
"Alone,"
 I say!” said Professor McGonagall’s voice 
through the darkness. “On what gr
ounds are you attacking him? He 
"has done nothing, nothin"
g to warrant such —” 
"Hermione, Parvati, and Lavender a"
ll screamed. No fewer than four 
Stunners had shot from the figures around the cabin toward Professor 
McGonagall. Halfway between cabin and castle the red beams col-
lided with her. For a moment she l
"ooked luminous, illuminated by an "
"eerie red glow, then was lifted right "
"off her feet, landed hard on her "
"back, and moved no more. "
"“Galloping gargoyles!” shouted Professor Tofty, who seemed to  "
 722 have forgotten the exam completely. “Not so much as a warning! Out-
rageous behavior!” 
"“COWARDS!” bellowed Hagrid, his"
 voice carrying clearly to the 
"top of the tower, and several lights "
flickered back on inside the castle. 
“RUDDY COWARDS! HAVE SOME O’ THAT — AN’ THAT —” 
“Oh my —” gasped Hermione. 
Hagrid took two massive swipes at 
his closest attackers; judging by 
their immediate co
"llapse, they had been knocked cold. Harry saw him "
double over and thought 
for a moment that he had finally been over-
"come by a spell, but on the cont"
"rary, next moment Hagrid was stand-"
ing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back — then Harry 
realized that Fang’s limp body 
was draped around his shoulders. 
"“Get him, get him!” screamed Um"
"bridge, but her remaining helper "
"seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of Hagrid’s fists. Indeed, "
he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious 
colleagues and fell over. Hagrid had turned and begun to run with 
Fang still hung around his neck; 
Umbridge sent one last Stunning 
"Spell after him but it missed, and Ha"
"grid, running full-"
pelt toward the 
"distant gates, disappea"
red into the darkness. 
There was a long minute’s quiver
"ing silence, everybody gazing "
openmouthed into the grounds. Then 
Professor Tofty’s voice said fee-
"bly, “Um . . . five minute"
"s to go, everybody . . .” "
Though he had only filled in tw
"o-thirds of his chart, Harry was "
"desperate for the end of the exam. When it came at last he, Ron, and "
Hermione forced their telescopes ha
phazardly back into their holders 
and dashed back down the spiral st
aircase. None of the students were 
going to bed — they were all talkin
g loudly and excitedly at the foot 
of the stairs about what
 they had 
witnessed. 
“That evil woman!” gasped Hermio
"ne, who seemed to be having "
difficulty talking due to rage. “Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the 
dead of night!” 
   723 “She clearly wanted to avoid anot
"her scene like Trelawney’s,” said "
"Ernie Macmillan sagely, sque"
ezing over to join them. 
"“Hagrid did well, didn’t"
" he?” said Ron, who looked more alarmed "
than impressed. “How come all the spells bounced off him?” 
"“It’ll be his giant blood,” said Hermione shakily. “It’s very hard to "
"Stun a giant, they’re like trolls, really tough. . . . But poor Professor "
McGonagall. . . . Four Stunners straig
"ht in the chest, and she’s not ex-"
"actly young, is she?” "
"“Dreadful, dreadful,” said Erni"
"e, shaking his head pompously. "
"“Well, I’m off to bed. "
". . . ’Night, all . . .” "
People around them were drifting 
"away, still talking excitedly about "
what they had just seen. 
“At least they didn’t get to take 
"Hagrid off to Azkaban,” said Ron. "
“I ’spect he’s gone to jo
"in Dumbledore, hasn’t he?” "
"“I suppose so,” said Hermione, who "
"looked tearful. “Oh, this is aw-"
"ful, I really thought Dumbledore wo"
"uld be back before long, but now "
we’ve lost Hagrid too. . . .” 
They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full. 
The commotion out in the ground
"s had woken several people, who "
"had hastened to rouse their friends. Seamus and Dean, who had ar-"
"rived ahead of Harry, Ron, and Herm"
"ione, were now telling everyone "
what they had heard from the 
top of the Astronomy Tower. 
“But why sack Hagrid now?” aske
"d Angelina Johnson, shaking her "
"head. “It’s not like Trelawney, he"
’s been teaching much better than 
usual this year!” 
"“Umbridge hates part-humans,” said Hermione bitterly, flopping "
down into an armchair. “She was al
ways going to try and get Hagrid 
out.” 
“And she thought Hagrid was putting
" nifflers in her office,” piped "
up Katie Bell. 
"“Oh blimey,” said Lee Jordan, coveri"
ng his mouth. “It’s me’s been  
 724 "putting the nifflers in her office, Fr"
"ed and George left me a couple, "
I’ve been levitating them in
 through her window. . . .” 
"“She’d have sacked him anyway,” said Dean. “He was too close to "
Dumbledore.” 
"“That’s true,” said Harry, sinkin"
g into an armchair beside Her-
mione’s. 
“I just hope Professor McGonagall’s 
"all right,” said Lavender tearfully. "
“They carried her back up to the 
"castle, we watched through the dor-"
"mitory window,” said Colin Creevey “S"
he didn’t look very well. . . .” 
"“Madam Pomfrey will sort her out,” said Alicia Spinnet firmly. "
“She’s never failed yet.” 
It was nearly four in the mo
rning before the common room 
cleared. Harry felt wide awake — the 
image of Hagrid sprinting away 
into the dark was haunting him. He
 was so angry wi
th Umbridge he 
could not think of a punishment 
"bad enough for her, though Ron’s "
suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts 
had its merits. He fell asleep co
ntemplating hideous revenges and 
arose from bed three hours late
r feeling distinctly unrested. 
"Their final exam, History of Magic, "
was not to take place until that 
afternoon. Harry would very much have 
liked to go back to bed after 
"breakfast, but he had b"
een counting on the morning for a spot of last-
"minute studying, so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the "
"common room window, trying hard not to doze off as he read through "
some of the notes stacked three-and-
a-half feet high that Hermione 
had lent him. 
The fifth years entered the Great Ha
ll at two o’cloc
k and took their 
places in front of their overturned examination papers. Harry felt ex-
hausted. He just wanted this to be over so that he could go and sleep. 
"Then tomorrow, he and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch "
pitch — he was going to have a fl
y on Ron’s broom and savor their 
freedom from studying. . . . 
   725 "“Turn over your papers,” said Pr"
ofessor Marchbanks from the front 
"of the Hall, flicking over the giant hourglass. “You may begin. . . .” "
Harry stared fixedly at 
the first question. It 
was several seconds be-
fore it occurred to him that he had 
not taken in a word of it; there was 
a wasp buzzing distractingly agains
"t one of the high windows. Slowly, "
"tortuously, he began "
to write an answer. 
He was finding it very difficult 
to remember names and kept con-
fusing dates. He simply skipped question four: 
"In your opinion, did "
"wand legislation contribute to, or lead"
" to better control of, goblin riots of"
the eighteenth century
? thinking that he would go
 back to it if he had 
time at the end. He had a stab at question five: 
How was the Statute of 
Secrecy breached in 
1749
 and what measures were introduced to prevent a 
recurrence
? but had a nagging suspicion th
at he had missed several im-
portant points. He had a feeling va
mpires had come into the story 
somewhere. . . . 
He looked ahead for a question he
 could definitely answer and his 
eyes alighted upon number ten. 
Describe the circumstances that le
d to the Formation of the Interna-
tional Confederation of Wizards and 
explain why the warlocks of Liecht-
enstein refused to join.
"I know this,"
" Harry thought, though his brain felt torpid and slack. "
"He could visualize a heading,"
 in Hermione’s handwriting: 
The Forma-
tion of the International Confederation of Wizards.
 . . He had read these 
notes only this morning. . . . 
"He began to write, looking up "
now and again to check the large 
hourglass on the desk beside Prof
essor Marchbanks. 
He was sitting 
"right behind Parvati Patil, whose long"
 dark hair fell below the back of 
her chair. Once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden 
lights that glistened in it when sh
e moved her head very slightly and 
had to give his own head 
a little shake to clear it. 
. . . 
the first Supreme Mugwump of th
e International Confederation
 726 "of Wizards was Pierre Bonaccord, b"
ut his appointment was contested by 
"the Wizarding community of Liechtenstein, because "
— 
All around Harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurry-
"ing, burrowing rats. The sun was ve"
ry hot on the back of his head. 
What was it that Bonaccord had do
ne to offend the wizards of Liecht-
enstein? Harry had a feelin
g it had something to do with trolls. . . . 
He gazed blankly at the back of Parv
ati’s head again. If he could only 
perform Legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and 
see what it was about trolls that 
had caused the breach between Pierre 
Bonaccord and Liechtenstein. . . . 
Harry closed his eyes and buried his
" face in his hands, so that the "
glowing red of his eyelids grew da
rk and cool. Bonaccord had wanted 
to stop troll-hunting and give the trolls rights . . . but Liechtenstein 
was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain 
trolls. . . . That was it. . . . 
He opened his eyes; they stung and 
watered at the sight of the blaz-
ing-white parchment. Slowly he wrote two lines about the trolls then 
read through what he had done so 
far. It did not seem very informa-
"tive or detailed, yet he was sure"
 Hermione’s notes on the confedera-
tion had gone on for 
pages and pages. . . . 
"He closed his eyes again, trying to see them, trying to remember. "
. . . The confederation had met for the 
"first time in France, yes, he had "
written that already. . . . 
Goblins had tried to attend and been ousted. . . . He had written 
that too. . . . 
And nobody from Liechtenstei
n had wanted to come . . . 
"Think,"
" he told himself, his face in "
"his hands, while all around him "
quills scratched out never-ending 
answers and the sand trickled 
through the hourglass 
at the front. . . . 
He was walking along th
"e cool, dark corridor "
to the Department of 
"Mysteries again, walking with a firm and purposeful tread, breaking  "
   727 "occasionally into a run, determined to"
 reach his destination at last. . . . 
The black door swung open for him as 
"usual, and here he was in the "
circular room with 
its many doors. . . . 
Straight across the stone floor an
d through the second door . . . 
patches of dancing ligh
t on the walls and floo
r and that odd mechan-
"ical clicking, but no"
" time to explore, "
he must hurry. . . . 
He jogged the last 
"few feet to the third door, which swung open "
just like the others. . . . 
Once again he was in 
the cathedral-sized room full of shelves and 
glass spheres. . . . His heart was beat
ing very fast now. . . . He was go-
ing to get there this time. . . . Wh
en he reached number ninety-seven 
he turned left and hurried along 
the aisle between 
two rows. . . . 
But there was a shape on the floor
" at the very end, a black shape "
moving upon the floor like a wo
unded animal. . . . Harry’s stomach 
contracted with fear . . 
. with excite
ment. . . . 
A voice issued from his own mout
"h, a high, cold voice empty of "
"any human kindness, “Take it for me. "
". . . Lift it down, now. . . . I "
cannot touch it . . . 
but you can. . . .” 
The black shape upon the floor sh
ifted a little. Harry saw a long-
fingered white hand clut
ching a wand rise on the end of his own arm 
". . . heard the high, "
"cold voice say, “"
Crucio
!” 
"The man on the floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand "
"but fell back, writhing. Harry was la"
"ughing. He raised his wand, the "
"curse lifted, and the figure gr"
oaned and became
 motionless. 
“Lord Voldemort is waiting. . . .” 
"Very slowly, his arms trembling, th"
e man on the ground raised his 
shoulders a few inches and lifted his head. His face was bloodstained 
"and gaunt, twisted in pain ye"
t rigid with defiance. . . . 
"“You’ll have to kill me,” whispered Sirius. "
"“Undoubtedly I shall in the end,” sa"
id the cold voice. “But you will 
"fetch it for me first, Black. . . . You "
think you have felt 
pain thus far?  
 728 Think again. . . . We have hours ah
ead of us and nobody to hear you 
scream. . . .” 
But somebody screamed as Voldemort lowered his wand again; 
somebody yelled and fell sideways o
ff a hot desk onto the cold stone 
"floor. Harry hit the ground and awoke, "
"still yelling, his scar on fire, as "
the Great Hall erupted all around him. 
I’m not going. . . . I don’t need 
the hospital wing. . . . I don’t 
want . . .” 
"He was gibbering, trying to pull away from Professor Tofty, who "
was looking at him with much co
"ncern, and who had just helped "
Harry out into the entrance hall while the students all around them 
stared. 
"“I’m — I’m fine, sir,” Harry stamme"
"red, wiping the sweat from his "
face. “Really . . . I ju
st fell asleep. . . . 
Had a nightmare . . .” 
“Pressure of examinations!” said
" the old wizard sympathetically, "
patting Harry shakily on the should
"er. “It happens, young man, it "
"happens! Now, a cooling drink of water, and perhaps you will be ready "
"to return to the Great Hall? The examination is nearly over, but you "
may be able to round off yo
ur last answer nicely?” 
"“Yes,” said Harry wildly. “I mean "
. . . no . . . I’ve done — done as 
"much as I can, "
I think. . . .” 
"“Very well, very well,” said the old "
wizard gently. “I shall go and 
"collect your examination paper, and "
I suggest that you go and have a 
nice lie down. . . .” 
I 
 730 "“I’ll do that,” said Harry, noddi"
ng vigorously. “Thanks very 
much.” 
He waited for the second when the old man’s heels disappeared 
over the threshold into the Great 
"Hall, then ran up the marble stair-"
case and then more staircases toward
" the hospital wing, hurtling along "
the corridors so fast that the port
"raits he passed muttered reproaches, "
and burst through the double doors 
"like a hurricane, causing Madam "
"Pomfrey, who had been "
spooning some bright blue liquid into Mon-
"tague’s open mouth, to shriek in alarm. "
"“Potter, what do you "
think you’re doing?” 
“I need to see Professor McGonaga
"ll,” gasped Harry, the breath "
tearing his lungs. “Now . 
. . It’s urgent. . . .” 
"“She’s not here, Potter,” said Mada"
m Pomfrey sadly. “She was trans-
ferred to St. Mungo’s this morning. 
Four Stunning Spells straight to 
the chest at her age?
 It’s a wonder they
 didn’t kill her.” 
“She’s . . . gone?” sa
"id Harry, stunned. "
The bell rang just outside the do
"rmitory, and he heard the usual "
distant rumbling of students starti
ng to flood out into the corridors 
above and below him. He remained
" quite still, looking at Madam "
Pomfrey. Terror was rising inside him. 
There was nobody left to tell. 
"Dumbledore had gone, Hagrid had "
"gone, but he had always expected Pr"
"ofessor McGonagall to be there, "
"irascible and inflexible, perhaps, but always dependably, solidly "
present. . . . 
"“I don’t wonder you’re shocked, Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey with "
a kind of fierce approval in her fa
ce. “As if one of them could have 
Stunned Minerva McGonagall face on 
"by daylight! Cowardice, that’s "
what it was. . . . Despicable coward
ice . . . If I wasn’t worried what 
would happen to you students without 
"me, I’d resign in "
protest. . . .” 
"“Yes,” said Harry blankly. "
He strode blindly from
 the hospital wing in
to the teeming corridor 
"where he stood, buffeted by the crowd, the panic expanding inside "
   731 him like poison gas so that his 
head swam and he could not think 
what to do. . . . 
"Ron and Hermione,"
 said a voice in his head. 
"He was running again, pushing st"
"udents out of the way, oblivious "
to their angry protests and shouts
. He sprinted back down two floors 
and was at the top of the marble st
aircase when he saw them hurrying 
toward him. 
"“Harry!” said Hermione at once, looking very frightened. “What "
happened? Are you all right? Are you ill?” 
“Where have you been?” demanded Ron. 
"“Come with me,” Harry said quickly. “Come on, I’ve got to tell "
you something. . . .” 
He led them along the first-fl
"oor corridor, peering through door-"
"ways, and at last found an empty cl"
"assroom into which he dived, clos-"
ing the door behind Ron and Hermione the moment they were inside 
"and leaning against it, facing them. "
“Voldemort’s got Sirius.” 
“
What
?” 
“How d’you — ?” 
“Saw it. Just now. When I fell asleep in the exam.” 
“But — but where? How?” said He
"rmione, whose face was white. "
"“I dunno how,” said Harry. “But "
I know exactly where. There’s a 
room in the Department of Mysterie
s full of shelves covered in these 
"little glass balls, and they’re at the "
end of row ninety-seven . . . He’s 
trying to use Sirius to get whatever 
it is he wants from in there. . . . 
He’s torturing him. . . . Says he
’ll end by killing him . . .” 
"Harry found his voice was shaking, as were his knees. He moved "
"over to a desk and sat down on it, trying to master himself. "
“How’re we going to get there?” he asked them. 
There was a moment’s silence. 
"Then Ron said, “G-get there?” "
“Get to the Department
" of Mysteries, so we can rescue Sirius!” "
Harry said loudly. 
 732 “But — Harry . . .” said Ron weakly. 
“What? 
What
?” said Harry. 
He could not understand why they were both gaping at him as 
though he was as
king them someth
ing unreasonable. 
"“Harry,” said Hermione in a rather frightened voice, “er . . . how "
. . . how did Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without any-
body realizing 
he was there?” 
“How do I know?” bellowed Har
ry. “The question is how 
we’re
going to get in there!” 
"“But . . . Harry, think about this,”"
" said Hermione, taking a step "
"toward him, “it’s five o’clock in "
the afternoon. . . . The Ministry of 
Magic must be full of workers. . . . How would Voldemort and Sirius 
have got in without be
ing seen? Harry . . . they
’re probably the two 
most wanted wizards in the world. 
. . . You think they could get into 
a building full of Aurors undetected?” 
"“I dunno, Voldemort used an Invi"
sibility Cloak or something!” 
"Harry shouted. “Anyway, the Depart"
ment of Mysteries has always 
been completely empty wh
enever I’ve been —” 
"“You’ve never been there, Harry,” "
said Hermione quietly. “You’ve 
"dreamed about the place, that’s all.” "
“They’re not normal dreams!” Har
"ry shouted in her face, standing "
up and taking a step closer to her 
in turn. He wanted to shake her. 
"“How d’you explain Ron’s dad then,"
" what was all that about, how "
come I knew what ha
d happened to him?” 
"“He’s got a point,” said Ron qu"
"ietly, looking at Hermione. "
“But this is just — just so 
unlikely
!” said Hermione desperately. 
"“Harry, how on earth co"
uld Voldemort have got hold of Sirius when 
he’s been in Grimmauld Place all the time?” 
“Sirius might’ve cracked and just wa
"nted some fresh air,” said Ron, "
sounding worried. “He’s been desperate to get out of that house for 
ages —” 
   733 "“But why,” Hermione persisted, “why on earth would Voldemort "
want to use 
Sirius
" to get the weapon, or whatever the thing is?” "
"“I dunno, there could be loads of"
 reasons!” Harry yelled at her. 
“Maybe Sirius is just someone Voldemort doesn’t care about seeing 
hurt —” 
"“You know what, I’ve just though"
"t of something,” said Ron in a "
hushed voice. “Sirius’s brother was 
"a Death Eater, wasn’t he? Maybe he "
told Sirius the secret of
 how to get the weapon!” 
“Yeah — and that’s why Dumbledore’
s been so keen to keep Sirius 
locked up all the time!” said Harry. 
"“Look, I’m sorry,” cried Hermione, “b"
ut neither of you are making 
"sense, and we’ve got no proof for an"
"y of this, no proof Voldemort and "
Sirius are even there —” 
"“Hermione, Harry’s seen them!” "
"said Ron, rounding on her. "
"“Okay,” she said, looking frightened"
" yet determined, “I’ve just got "
to say this. . . .” 
“What?” 
"“You . . . This isn’t a criticism, Ha"
rry! But you do . . . sort of . . . I 
mean — don’t you think you’ve got a bit of a — a — 
saving-people-
thing
?” she said. 
He glared at her. “And what’s 
"that supposed to mean, a ‘saving-"
people-thing’?” 
“Well . . . you . . .” She looked 
more apprehensive than ever. “I 
"mean . . . last year, for instance . . "
. in the lake . . . during the Tourna-
ment . . . you shouldn’t have . . . I 
"mean, you didn’t need to save that "
little Delacour girl. . . . You got 
a bit . . . carried away . . .” 
"A wave of hot, prickly anger sw"
ept Harry’s body — how could she 
remind him of th
at blunder now? 
"“. . . I mean, it was really grea"
"t of you and everything,” said "
"Hermione quickly, looking positively"
 petrified at the look on Harry’s 
face. “Everyone thought it wa
s a wonderful thing to do —” 
 734 "“That’s funny,” said Harry in a trembl"
"ing voice, “because I definitely "
remember Ron saying
 I’d wasted time 
acting the hero.
 . . . Is that what 
you think this is? You reckon I 
want to act th
e hero again?” 
"“No, no, no!” said Hermione, lo"
oking aghast. “That’s not what I 
mean at all!” 
"“Well, spit out what you’ve got to"
" say, because we’re wasting time "
here!” Harry shouted. 
“I’m trying to say — Voldemort 
"knows you, Harry! He took Ginny "
"down into the Chamber of Secrets to lure you there, it’s the kind of "
"thing he does, he knows you’re the "
— the sort of person who’d go to 
Sirius’s aid! What if he’s just tryi
ng to get you into the Department of 
Myst — ?” 
"“Hermione, it doesn’t matter if he’s done it to get me there or "
not — they’ve taken McGonagall to 
"St. Mungo’s, there isn’t anyone "
left from the Order at Hogwarts wh
"o we can tell, and if we don’t go, "
Sirius is dead!” 
“But Harry — what if your drea
"m was — was just that, a dream?” "
Harry let out a roar of frustration.
 Hermione actually stepped back 
"from him, looking alarmed. "
“You don’t get it!” Harry shouted 
at her. “I’m not having night-
"mares, I’m not just dreaming! Wh"
at d’you think all the Occlumency 
"was for, why d’you think Dumble"
dore wanted me prevented from 
seeing these things? Because they
"’re REAL, Hermione — Sirius is "
trapped — I’ve seen him — Voldem
"ort’s got him, and no one else "
"knows, and that means we’re the only"
" ones who can save him, and if "
"you don’t want to do it, fine, but I’"
"m going, understand? And if I re-"
"member rightly, you didn’t have a problem with my "
saving-people-thing
when it was you I was saving from 
"the dementors, or” — he rounded "
on Ron — “when it was your sister 
I was saving from the basilisk —” 
“I never said I had a prob
lem!” said Ron heatedly. 
"“But Harry, you’ve just said it,”"
 said Hermione fiercely. “Dumble- 
   735 dore wanted you to learn to shut th
"ese things out of your mind, if "
you’d done Occlumency properly yo
u’d never have 
seen this —” 
“IF YOU THINK I’M JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE I 
HAVEN’T SEEN —” 
“Sirius told you there was nothin
g more important than you learn-
ing to close your mind!” 
"“WELL, I EXPECT HE’D SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF "
HE KNEW WHAT I’D JUST —” 
"The classroom door opened. Harry,"
" Ron, and Hermione whipped "
"around. Ginny walked in, looking cu"
"rious, followed by Luna, who as "
usual looked as though she 
had drifted in 
accidentally. 
"“Hi,” said Ginny uncertainly. "
“We recognized Harry’s voice — 
what are you yelling about?” 
"“Never you mind,” sa"
id Harry roughly. 
Ginny raised her eyebrows. 
“There’s no need to take that tone 
"with me,” she said coolly. “I was "
only wondering whether I could help.” 
"“Well, you can’t,” sa"
id Harry shortly. 
"“You’re being rather rude, you "
"know,” said Luna serenely. "
Harry swore and turned away. The 
very last thing he wanted now 
was a conversa
tion with Luna Lovegood. 
"“Wait,” said Hermione suddenly. “Wait . . . Harry, they "
can
 help.” 
Harry and Ron looked at her. 
"“Listen,” she said urgently, “Har"
"ry, we need to establish whether "
Sirius really has le
ft headquarters —” 
"“I’ve told you, I saw —” "
"“Harry, I’m begging you, please!”"
 said Hermione desperately. 
“Please let’s just check that Sirius is
n’t at home before we go charging 
off to London — if we find out he
’s not there then I swear I won’t try 
"and stop you, I’ll come, I’ll d-do "
whatever it takes to try and save 
him —” 
 736 “Sirius is being tortured NOW!” 
shouted Harry. “We haven’t got 
time to waste —” 
“But if this is a trick of V-Voldem
"ort’s — Harry, we’ve got to check, "
we’ve got to —” 
“How?” Harry demanded. “How
’re we going to check?” 
“We’ll have to use Umbridge’s fire
" and see if we can contact him,” "
"said Hermione, who looked positively"
 terrified at the thought. “We’ll 
"draw Umbridge away again, but we"
"’ll need lookouts, and that’s where "
we can use Ginny and Luna.” 
Though clearly struggling to unde
"rstand what was going on, Ginny "
"said immediately, “Yeah, we’ll do it,” and Luna said, “When you say "
"‘Sirius,’ are you talking about Stubby Boardman?” "
Nobody answered her. 
"“Okay,” Harry said aggressively to Hermione, “Okay, if you can "
think of a way of doing this quickl
"y, I’m with you, otherwise I’m go-"
ing to the Department of
 Mysteries right now —” 
"“The Department of Mysteries?” said Luna, looking mildly sur-"
prised. “But how are you going to get there?” 
"Again, Harry ignored her. "
"“Right,” said Hermione, twisting her hands together and pacing up "
and down between the desks. “Right . . 
. well . . . One of us has to go 
"and find Umbridge and — and send her off in the wrong direction, "
keep her away from her office. They
 could tell her 
— I don’t know — 
that Peeves is up to something awful as usual. . . .” 
"“I’ll do it,” said Ron at once. “I’"
ll tell her Peeves is smashing up the 
"Transfiguration department or something, it’s miles away from her of-"
fice. Come to think of it
", I could probably"
 persuade Peeves to do it if 
I met him on the way. . . .” 
It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made 
no objection to the smashing up 
of the Transfiguration department. 
"“Okay,” she said, her brow furrowed as she continued to pace.  "
   737 "“Now, we need to keep students away"
 from her office while we force 
"entry, or some Slytherin’s bound "
to go and tip her off. . . .” 
“Luna and I can stand at either 
"end of the corridor,” said Ginny "
"promptly, “and warn people not to"
 go down there because someone’s 
let off a load of Garroting Gas.” Hermione looked surprised at the 
readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie. Ginny shrugged 
"and said, “Fred and George were planni"
ng to do it before they left.” 
"“Okay,” said Hermione, “well then, Harry, you and I will be under "
"the Invisibility Cloak, and we’ll snea"
k into the office and you can talk 
to Sirius —” 
"“He’s not there, Hermione!” "
"“I mean, you can — can check whet"
her Sirius is at home or not 
"while I keep watch, I don’t think you should be in there alone, Lee’s "
already proved the window’s a we
"ak spot, sending those nifflers "
through it.” 
Even through his anger and impa
tience Harry recognized Her-
mione’s offer to accompany him into 
Umbridge’s office as a sign of 
solidarity and loyalty. 
"“I . . . okay, thanks,” he muttered. "
"“Right, well, even if we do all of "
"that, I don’t think we’re going to "
be able to bank on more than fi
"ve minutes,” said Hermione, looking "
relieved that Harry seemed to have 
"accepted the plan, “not with Filch "
and the wretched Inquisitoria
l Squad floating around.” 
"“Five minutes’ll be enough,” sa"
"id Harry. “C’mon, let’s go —” "
“
Now
"?” said Hermione, looking shocked. "
“Of course now!” said Harry angril
"y. “What did you think, we’re "
going to wait until after dinner or 
"something? Hermione, Sirius is be-"
ing tortured 
right now
!” 
"“I — oh all right,” she said desper"
ately. “You go and get the Invisi-
bility Cloak and we’ll meet you at
" the end of Umbridge’s corridor, "
okay?” 
 738 "Harry did not answer, but flung himself out of the room and began "
to fight his way through 
the milling crowds outside. Two floors up he 
"met Seamus and Dean, who hailed him jovially and told him they "
were planning a dusk-till-dawn en
d-of-exams celebration in the com-
mon room. Harry barely heard them
. He scrambled through the por-
trait hole while they were still ar
guing about how many black-market 
butterbeers they would need and was 
"climbing back out of it, the In-"
visibility Cloak and Sirius’s knife secu
"re in his bag, be"
fore they noticed 
he had left them. 
"“Harry, d’you want to chip in a couple of Galleons? Harold Dingle "
reckons he could 
sell us some firewhisky. . . .” 
"But Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor, and a "
"couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron, "
"Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, who were"
 huddled together at the end 
of Umbridge’s corridor. 
"“Got it,” he panted. “Ready to go, then?” "
"“All right,” whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth years "
"passed them. “So Ron — you go and head Umbridge off. . . . Ginny, "
"Luna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor. . . . Harry "
and I will get the cloak on and wait
 until the coast is
 clear. . . .” 
"Ron strode away, his bright red hair"
 visible right to the end of the 
"passage. Meanwhile, Ginny’s equa"
lly vivid head bobbed between the 
"jostling students surrounding them in the other direction, trailed by "
Luna’s blonde one. 
"“Get over here,” muttered Hermio"
"ne, tugging at Harry’s wrist and "
pulling him back into a recess where 
the ugly stone head of a medieval 
wizard stood muttering to itself on a column. “Are — are you sure 
"you’re okay, Harry? You’re"
 still very pale. . . .” 
"“I’m fine,” he said shortly, tuggin"
g the Invisibility Cloak from out 
"of his bag. In truth, his scar was aching, but not so badly that he "
thought Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius
 a fatal blow. It had hurt much 
worse than this when Voldemort 
had been punishing Avery. . . . 
   739 "“Here,” he said. He threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them "
and they stood listening carefully 
over the Latin mumblings of the 
bust in front of them. 
“You can’t come down here!” Ginny 
"was calling to the crowd. “No, "
"sorry, you’re going to have to go "
"round by the swiveling staircase, "
someone’s let off Garroting 
Gas just along here —” 
They could hear people complainin
"g; one surly voice said, “I can’t "
see no gas . . .” 
"“That’s because it’s colorless,” sa"
id Ginny in a convincingly exas-
"perated voice, “but if you want to"
" walk through it, carry on, then we’ll "
have your body as proof for the next
 idiot who didn’t 
believe us. . . .” 
Slowly the crowd thinned. The news about the Garroting Gas 
seemed to have spread — people were not coming this way anymore. 
When at last the surrounding area 
"was quite clear, Hermione said qui-"
"etly, “I think that’s as good as we"
"’re going to get,"
" Harry — come on, "
let’s do it.” 
"Together they moved forward, co"
vered by the cloak. Luna was 
standing with her back to them at 
the far end of the corridor. As they 
"passed Ginny, Hermione whispered, "
“Good one . . . don’t forget the 
signal . . .” 
"“What’s the signal?” muttered Harry, as they approached Urn-"
bridge’s door. 
“A loud chorus of ‘Weasley Is Ou
r King’ if they see Umbridge com-
"ing,” replied Hermione, as Harry insert"
ed the blade of Sirius’s knife in 
the crack between door and wall. The 
"lock clicked open, and they en-"
tered the office. 
The garish kittens were basking 
in the late afternoon sunshine 
"warming their plates, but otherwise th"
e office was as still and empty as 
last time. Hermione brea
thed a sigh of relief. 
“I thought she might have added extra security after the second 
niffler. . . .” 
They pulled off the cloak. Hermio
ne hurried over to the window 
 740 "and stood out of sight, peering down "
into the grounds with her wand 
out. Harry dashed over to the firepl
"ace, seized the pot of Floo powder, "
"and threw a pinch into the grate, ca"
using emerald flames to burst into 
"life there. He knelt down quickly, "
thrust his head into the dancing 
"fire, and cried, “Number "
"twelve, Grimmauld Place!” "
His head began to spin 
as though he had just
 got off a fairground 
ride though his knees remained firm
ly planted upon the cold office 
floor. He kept his eyes screwed up 
"against the whirling ash, and when "
"the spinning stopped, he opened th"
em to find himself looking out 
"upon the long, cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place. "
"There was nobody there. He had expected this, yet was not pre-"
pared for the molten wa
ve of dread and panic 
that seemed to burst 
through his stomach floor at the sight of the deserted room. 
"“Sirius?” he shouted. “Sirius, are you there?” "
"His voice echoed around the room, "
but there was no answer except 
a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire. 
"“Who’s there?” he called, wonderin"
g whether it was just a mouse. 
Kreacher the house-elf came creepin
g into view. He looked highly 
"delighted about something, though he seemed to have recently sus-"
tained a nasty injury 
"to both hands, which were heavily bandaged. "
“It’s the Potter boy’s head in the 
"fire,” Kreacher informed the empty "
"kitchen, stealing furtive, oddly tr"
iumphant glances at Harry. “What 
"has he come for, Kreacher wonders?” "
"“Where’s Sirius, Kreach"
er?” Harry demanded. 
The house-elf gave a wheezy chuckl
"e. “Master has gone out, Harry "
Potter.” 
“Where’s he gone? 
"Where’s he gone, Kreacher"
?” 
Kreacher merely cackled. 
"“I’m warning you!” said Harry, fully"
 aware that his scope for inflict-
ing punishment upon Kreacher was almost nonexistent in this position. 
“What about Lupin? Mad-Eye? Any 
"of them, are any of them here?” "
   741 "“Nobody here but Kreacher!” said the elf gleefully, and turning "
away from Harry he began to walk 
slowly toward the door at the end 
of the kitchen. “Kreacher thinks he will have a little chat with his 
"Mistress now, yes, he hasn’t had a "
"chance in a long time, Kreacher’s "
Master has been keeping him away from her —” 
“Where has Sirius gone?” 
Harry yelled after the elf. “
"Kreacher, has "
he gone to the Department of Mysteries
?” 
Kreacher stopped in his tracks. Harry could just make out the back 
of his bald head through the fo
rest of chair legs before him. 
“Master does not tell poor Kreacher 
"where he is going,” said the elf "
quietly. 
“But you know!” shouted Harry.
 “Don’t you? You know where 
he is!” 
"There was a moment’s silence, then "
the elf let out his loudest cackle 
yet. “Master will not come back from the Department of Mysteries!” 
he said gleefully. “Kreacher an
d his Mistress ar
e alone again!” 
And he scurried forward and disa
ppeared through the door to the 
hall. 
“You — !” 
But before he could utter a single
" curse or insult, Harry felt a great "
pain at the top of his head. He in
"haled a lot of ash and, choking, "
found himself being dragged backward
" through the flames until, with "
"a horrible abruptness, he was staring "
"up into the wide, pallid face of "
"Professor Umbridge, who had dragge"
d him backward out of the fire 
by the hair and was now bending his ne
ck back as far as it would go as 
though she was going 
to slit his throat. 
"“You think,” she whispered, b"
ending Harry’s neck back even far-
"ther, so that he was looking up at"
" the ceiling above him, “that after "
two nifflers I was going to let one mo
"re foul, scavenging little creature "
enter my office without my knowledg
e? I had Stealth Sensoring Spells 
placed all around my doorway after 
"the last one got in, you foolish  "
 742 "boy. Take his wand,” she barked at"
" someone he could not see, and he "
felt a hand grope inside the chest po
cket of his robes and remove the 
wand. “Hers too . . .” 
Harry heard a scuffle over by th
e door and knew that Hermione 
had just had her wand wr
ested from her as well. 
“I want to know why you are in 
"my office,” said Umbridge, shak-"
ing the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered. 
“I was — trying to get my 
Firebolt!” Harry croaked. 
“Liar.” She shook his head again. 
“Your Firebolt is under strict 
"guard in the dungeons, as you very well know, Potter. You had your "
head in my fire. With whom have you been communicating?” 
"“No one —” said Harry, trying to"
 pull away from her. He felt sev-
eral hairs part comp
any with his scalp. 
“
Liar
"!” shouted Umbridge. She threw him from her, and he "
slammed into the desk. Now he co
uld see Hermione pinioned against 
the wall by Millicent Bulstrode. Malfoy was leaning on the win-
"dowsill, smirking as he threw Har"
ry’s wand into the air one-handed 
and then caught it again. 
There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins 
"entered, each gripping Ron, Ginn"
"y, Luna, and — to Harry’s bewil-"
"derment — Neville, who was trappe"
d in a stranglehold by Crabbe 
and looked in imminent danger of suffocation. All four of them had 
been gagged. 
"“Got ’em all,” said Warrington, "
shoving Ron roughly forward into 
the room. “
That
 one.” he poked a thick finger
" at Neville, “tried to stop "
me taking 
"her,"
"” he pointed at Ginny, who was trying to kick the shins "
of the large Slytherin girl holding 
"her, “so I brough"
t him along too.” 
"“Good, good,” said Umbridge, watc"
"hing Ginny’s struggles. “Well, "
"it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley-free zone, "
doesn’t it?” 
Malfoy laughed loudly and sycoph
antically. Umbridge gave her  
   743 "wide, complacent smile and settled "
herself into a chintz-covered arm-
"chair, blinking up at"
 her captives like a toad in a flowerbed. 
"“So, Potter,” she said. “You statio"
ned lookouts around my office 
"and you sent this buffoon,” she n"
"odded at Ron, and Malfoy laughed "
"even louder, “to tell me the polter"
geist was wreaking havoc in the 
Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was 
busy smearing ink on the eyepieces 
of all the school
" telescopes, Mr. "
Filch having just informed me so. 
"“Clearly, it was very important for you to talk to somebody. Was it "
"Albus Dumbledore? Or the half-breed, Hagrid? I doubt it was Min-"
"erva McGonagall, I hear "
she is still too ill to 
talk to anyone. . . .” 
Malfoy and a few of the other me
mbers of the Inquisitorial Squad 
laughed some more at that. Harry foun
d he was so full of rage and ha-
tred he was shaking. 
“It’s none of your business 
"who I talk to,”"
 he snarled. 
Umbridge’s slack face seemed to tighten. 
"“Very well,” she said in her most "
dangerous and falsely sweet voice. 
"“Very well, Mr. Potter . . . I offered "
you the chance to tell me freely. 
You refused. I have no alternative but to force you. Draco — fetch 
Professor Snape.” 
Malfoy stowed Harry’s wand inside his robes and left the room 
"smirking, but Harry hardly noticed. He had just realized some-"
thing; he could not beli
eve he had been so stupid
 as to forget it. He 
"had thought that all the members of the Order, all those who could "
"help him save Sirius, were gone — but he had been wrong. There "
was still a member of the Order 
of the Phoenix 
at Hogwarts — 
Snape. 
There was silence in the office ex
cept for the fidgetings and scuf-
flings resultant from the Slytherins
’ efforts to keep Ro
n and the others 
under control. Ron’s lip was bleedin
g onto Umbridge’s carpet as he 
struggled against Warrington’s half 
nelson. Ginny was still trying to  
 744 stamp on the feet of the sixth-year 
girl who had both her upper arms 
in a tight grip. Neville was turning steadily more purple in the face 
"while tugging at Crabbe’s arms, an"
d Hermione was attempting vainly 
"to throw Millicent Bulstrode off her. Luna, however, stood limply by "
"the side of her captor, gazing vaguely out of the window as though "
rather bored by the proceedings. 
"Harry looked back at Umbridge, "
who was watching him closely. 
He kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were 
heard in the corridor outside and Dr
aco Malfoy came back into the 
"room, holding open "
the door for Snape. 
"“You wanted to see me, Headmistress?” said Snape, looking around "
at all the pairs of struggling studen
ts with an expression of complete 
indifference. 
"“Ah, Professor Snape,” said Umbridge, smiling widely and standing "
"up again. “Yes, I would like another "
bottle of Veritase
"rum, as quick as "
"you can, please.” "
“You took my last bottle to inte
"rrogate Potter,” he said, observing "
her coolly through his greasy curtai
ns of black hair. “Surely you did 
not use it all? I told you that 
three drops would 
be sufficient.” 
Umbridge flushed. 
"“You can make some more, can’t "
"you?” she said, her voice becom-"
ing more sweetly girlish as it al
ways did when she was furious. 
"“Certainly,” said Snape, his lip cu"
rling. “It takes a 
full moon cycle 
"to mature, so I should have it "
ready for you in around a month.” 
“A month?” squawked Umbridge
", swelling toadishly. “A "
month
? 
"But I need it this evening, Snape! "
I have just found Potter using my 
fire to communicate with a 
person or persons unknown!” 
"“Really?” said Snape, showing his firs"
"t, faint sign of interest as he "
"looked around at Harry. “Well, it do"
esn’t surprise me. Potter has never 
shown much inclination to follow school rules.” 
"His cold, dark eyes were boring "
"into Harry’s, who met his gaze un- "
   745 "flinchingly, concentrating hard on"
" what he had seen in his dream, "
willing Snape to read it in 
"his mind, to understand . . . "
"“I wish to interrogate him!” shouted Umbridge angrily, and Snape "
looked away from Harry back into her furiously quivering face. “I 
wish you to provide me with a potion
 that will force him to tell me 
the truth!” 
"“I have already told you,” said Sn"
"ape smoothly, “that I have no fur-"
ther stocks of Veritaserum. Unless 
you wish to poison Potter — and I 
assure you I would have the greatest
 sympathy with you if you did — 
I cannot help you. The only trouble 
is that most venoms act too fast 
to give the victim much time
 for truth-telling. . . .” 
"Snape looked back at Harry, who "
"stared at him, frantic to commu-"
nicate without words. 
Voldemort’s got Sirius in t
"he Department of Mysteries,"
 he thought des-
perately. 
Voldemort’s got Sirius 
— 
“You are on probation!” shrieked
" Professor Umbridge, and Snape "
"looked back at her, his eyebrows slightly raised. “You are being delib-"
"erately unhelpful! I expected better, "
Lucius Malfoy always speaks most 
highly of you! Now get out of my office!” 
Snape gave her an ironic bow and 
turned to leave. Harry knew his 
last chance of letting the Order kn
ow what was going on was walking 
out of the door. 
“He’s got Padfoot!” he shouted. 
“He’s got Padfoot at the place 
where it’s hidden!” 
Snape had stopped with his hand
 on Umbridge’s
 door handle. 
“Padfoot?” cried Professor Umbrid
"ge, looking eagerly from Harry "
to Snape. “What is Padfoot? Wher
e what is hidden? What does he 
"mean, Snape?” "
Snape looked around at Harry. His face was inscrutable. Harry 
could not tell whether he had unders
"tood or not, but he did not dare "
speak more plainly in front of Umbridge. 
 746 "“I have no idea,” said Snape co"
"ldly. “Potter, when I want nonsense "
shouted at me I shall give you 
"a Babbling Beverage. And Crabbe, "
"loosen your hold a little, if Longbott"
om suffocates it will mean a lot of 
"tedious paperwork, and I am afraid I "
shall have to mention it on your 
reference if ever you apply for a job.” 
"He closed the door behind him with a snap, leaving Harry in a state "
of worse turmoil than before: Snap
e had been his very last hope. He 
"looked at Umbridge, who seemed to"
 be feeling the same way; her 
chest was heaving with 
rage and frustration. 
"“Very well,” she said, and she pull"
ed out her wand. “Very well . . . 
I am left with no alternative. . . . T
his is more than a matter of school 
discipline. . . . This is an issue of
 Ministry security. . . . Yes . . . 
yes . . .” 
She seemed to be talking herself 
into something. She was shifting 
her weight nervously from foot to 
"foot, staring at Harry, beating her "
wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily. Harry felt horri-
bly powerless without his own wand as he watched her. 
"“You are forcing me, Potter. . . . "
"I do not want to,” said Umbridge, "
still moving restlessly on the spot
", “but sometimes circumstances jus-"
tify the use . . . I am sure the Mini
ster will understand that I had no 
choice. . . .” 
Malfoy was watching her with a 
hungry expression on his face. 
"“The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,” said Um-"
bridge quietly. 
“No!” shrieked Hermione. “Professo
r Umbridge — it’s illegal” — 
but Umbridge took no notice. There 
"was a nasty, eager, excited look "
on her face that Harry had never 
seen before. She raised her wand. 
“The Minister wouldn’t want you 
"to break the law, Professor Um-"
bridge!” cried Hermione. 
“What Cornelius doesn’t know wo
"n’t hurt him,” said Umbridge, "
who was now panting slightly as sh
e pointed her wand at different  
   747 "parts of Harry’s body in turn, appar"
ently trying to decide what would 
hurt the most. “He never knew I or
dered dementors after Potter last 
"summer, but he was delighted to be "
"given the chance to expel him, all "
the same. . . .” 
“It was 
you
?” gasped Harry. “
You
 sent the dementors after me?” 
“
Somebody
" had to act,” breathed Umbridge, as her wand came to "
rest pointing directly at Harry’s 
forehead. “They were all bleating 
about silencing you somehow — di
screditing you — but I was the 
one who actually 
did
 something about it. . . 
. Only you wriggled out 
"of that one, didn’t yo"
"u, Potter? Not today, "
"though, not now . . .” "
And taking a deep br
"eath, she cried, “"
Cruc
 —” 
“NO!” shouted Hermione in a cracked voice from behind Milli-
cent Bulstrode. “No — 
"Harry — Harry, we’ll have to tell her!” "
"“No way!” yelled Harry, staring at "
the little of Hermione he could 
see. 
"“We’ll have to, Harry, she’ll force "
"it out of you anyway, what’s . . . "
what’s the point. . . ?” 
And Hermione began to cry weakly 
into the back of Millicent Bul-
strode’s robes. Millicent stopped tryi
ng to squash her against the wall 
immediately and dodged out of 
her way looking disgusted. 
"“Well, well, well!” said Umbrid"
"ge, looking triumphant. “Little "
Miss Question-All is going to give 
"us some answers! Come on then, "
"girl, come on!” "
“Er — my — nee — no!” shou
ted Ron through his gag. 
Ginny was staring at Hermione as
 though she had never seen her 
"before; Neville, still choking for br"
"eath, was gazing at her too. But "
Harry had just noticed something. Though Hermione was sobbing 
"desperately into her hands, ther"
e was no trace of a tear. . . . 
"“I’m — I’m sorry everyone,” said "
Hermione. “But — I can’t stand 
it —” 
"“That’s right, that’s right, girl!”"
" said Umbridge, seizing Hermione  "
 748 "by the shoulders, thrusting her into the abandoned chintz chair and "
leaning over her. “Now then . . . with whom was Potter communicat-
ing just now?” 
"“Well,” gulped Hermione into "
"her hands, “well, he was "
trying
 to 
speak to Professor Dumbledore. . . .” 
"Ron froze, his eyes wide; Ginny "
stopped trying to stamp on her 
Slytherin captor’s toes; even Luna looked mildly surprised. Fortu-
"nately, the attention of Umbridge"
 and her minions was focused too 
exclusively upon Hermione to no
tice these suspicious signs. 
“Dumbledore?” said Umbridge eagerly. “You know where Dumb-
"ledore is, then?” "
“Well . . . no!” sobbed Hermione
. “We’ve tried 
the Leaky Caul-
dron in Diagon Alley and the Thr
ee Broomsticks and even the Hog’s 
Head —” 
"“Idiot girl, Dumbledore won’t be "
sitting in a pub when the whole 
Ministry’s looking for him!” sh
"outed Umbridge, disappointment "
etched in every saggin
g line of her face. 
“But — but we needed 
to tell him somethin
g important!” wailed 
"Hermione, holding her hands more "
"tightly over her face, not, Harry "
"knew, out of anguish, but to disgui"
se the continued absence of tears. 
“Yes?” said Umbridge with a 
sudden resurgence of excitement. 
“What was it you wanted to tell him?” 
“We . . . we wanted to
 tell him it’s r-read
y!” choked Hermione. 
“What’s ready?” demanded Um
"bridge, and now she grabbed "
"Hermione’s shoulders again and shook her slightly. “What’s ready, "
girl?” 
“The . . . the weapon
",” said Hermione. "
"“Weapon? Weapon?” said Umbridge, and her eyes seemed to pop "
with excitement. “You have been 
developing some method of resis-
tance? A weapon you could use ag
ainst the Ministry? On Professor 
Dumbledore’s orders
", of course?” "
   749 "“Y-y-yes,” gasped Hermione. “But he"
 had to leave before it was fin-
ished and n-n-now we’ve finished it 
"for him, and we c-c-can’t find him "
t-t-to tell him!” 
“What kind of weapon is it?” sa
"id Umbridge harshly, her stubby "
hands still tight on He
rmione’s shoulders. 
"“We don’t r-r-really understand it,”"
" said Hermione, sniffing loudly. "
“We j-j-just did what P-P-Profe
ssor Dumbledore told us t-t-to 
do . . .” 
"Umbridge straightened up, looking exultant. "
“Lead me to the we
"apon,” she said. "
“I’m not showing . . . 
them
",” said Hermione shrilly, looking around "
at the Slytherins th
rough her fingers. 
“It is not for you to set condit
"ions,” said Professor Umbridge "
harshly. 
"“Fine,” said Hermione, now sobbin"
"g into her hands again, “fine "
". . . let them see it, I hope they use it on you! In fact, I wish you’d in-"
vite loads and loads of people to 
come and see! Th-that would serve 
"you right — oh, I’d love it if the wh"
"-whole school knew where it was, "
"and how to u-use it, and then if you "
annoy any of them they’ll be able 
to s-sort you out!” 
These words had a powerful impact on Umbridge. She glanced 
swiftly and suspiciously around at 
"her Inquisitorial Squad, her bulging "
eyes resting for a moment on Malfoy
", who was too slow to disguise the "
look of eagerness and greed th
at had appeared on his face. 
Umbridge contemplated Hermione
 for another long moment and 
then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice. “All 
"right, dear, let’s make it just you an"
"d me . . . and we’ll take Potter too, "
"shall we? Get up, now —” "
"“Professor,” said Malfoy eagerl"
"y, “Professor Umbridge, I think "
some of the squad should come
 with you to look after —” 
“I am a fully qualified Ministry offi
"cial, Malfoy, do you really think  "
 750 I cannot manage two wandless t
eenagers alone?” asked Umbridge 
"sharply. “In any case, it does not sound as though this weapon is "
something that schoolchildren should
 see. You will remain here until 
I return and make sure none of thes
"e” — she gestured around at Ron, "
"Ginny, Neville, and Luna — “escape.” "
"“All right,” said Malfoy, lo"
oking sulky and disappointed. 
"“And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way,” said Um-"
"bridge, pointing at Harry and "
Hermione with her wand. “Lead 
on. . . .” 
Harry had no idea what Herm
"ione was planning, or even "
whether she had a plan. He walked
 half a pace behind her as 
they headed down the corridor outsid
"e Umbridge’s office, knowing it "
would look very suspicious if he 
appeared not to know where they 
were going. He did not dare attemp
t to talk to her; Umbridge was 
walking so closely behind them th
at he could hear her ragged 
breathing. 
Hermione led the way down the stai
rs into the entrance hall. The 
din of loud voices and the clatter of
 cutlery on plates echoed from out 
of the double doors to the Great Hall
. It seemed incredible to Harry 
that twenty feet away were people
" who were enjoying dinner, cele-"
"brating the end of exams, not "
a care in the 
world. . . . 
Hermione walked straight out of
 the oak front doors and down the 
stone steps into the balmy evening ai
r. The sun was falling toward the 
tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now as Hermione marched 
"purposefully across the grass, Umbr"
idge jogging to keep up. Their 
long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks. 
H 
 752 "“It’s hidden in Hagrid’s hut, is it"
?” said Umbridge eagerly in Harry’s 
ear. 
"“Of course not,” said Hermione sc"
athingly. “Hagrid might have set 
it off accidentally.” 
"“Yes,” said Umbridge, whose exci"
tement seemed to be mounting. 
"“Yes, he would have done, of course"
", the great half-breed oaf. . . .” "
She laughed. Harry felt a strong urge to swing around and seize her 
"by the throat, but resisted. His scar"
 was throbbing in the soft evening 
air but it had not yet burned white-ho
"t, as he knew it would if Volde-"
mort had moved in 
for the kill. . . . 
“Then . . . where is it?” asked Um
"bridge, with a hint of uncertainty "
in her voice as Hermione continue
d to stride toward the forest. 
"“In there, of course,” said Hermio"
"ne, pointing into the dark trees. "
“It had to be somewhere that student
s weren’t going to find it acci-
"dentally, di"
dn’t it?” 
"“Of course,” said Umbridge, thou"
gh she sounded a little apprehen-
"sive now. “Of course . . . very well, then . . . you two stay ahead of "
me.” 
"“Can we have your wand, then, "
if we’re going fi
rst?” Harry asked 
her. 
"“No, I don’t think so, Mr. Potter,”"
" said Umbridge sweetly, poking "
him in the back with it. “The Minist
ry places a rather higher value on 
"my life than yours, I’m afraid.” "
"As they reached the cool shade of the first trees, Harry tried to catch "
Hermione’s eye; walking into the fo
rest without wand
s seemed to him 
to be more foolhardy than anything 
they had done so far this evening. 
"She, however, merely gave Umbridge a contemptuous glance and "
"plunged straight into the trees, movi"
"ng at such a pace that Umbridge, "
with her shorter le
"gs, had difficulty"
 in keeping up. 
"“Is it very far in?” Umbridge asked,"
 as her robe ripped on a bramble. 
"“Oh yes,” said Hermione. "
"“Yes, it’s well hidden.” "
Harry’s misgivings increased. He
rmione was not taking the path 
   753 "they had followed to visit Grawp, "
but the one he had followed three 
years ago to the lair of the mo
nster Aragog. Hermione had not been 
with him on that occasion; he doubt
ed she had any idea what danger 
lay at the end of it. 
“Er — are you sure this is the ri
ght way?” he asked her pointedly. 
"“Oh yes,” she said in a steely "
"voice, crashing through the under-"
growth with what he thought was 
a wholly unnecessary amount of 
"noise. Behind them, Umbridge tri"
pped over a fallen sapling. Neither 
"of them paused to help her up again; Hermione merely strode on, "
"calling loudly over her shoulder, “It’s a bit further in!” "
"“Hermione, keep your voice dow"
"n,” Harry muttered, hurrying to "
catch up with her. “Anything co
uld be listening in here —” 
"“I want us heard,” she answered qu"
"ietly, as Umbridge jogged nois-"
ily after them. “You
’ll see. . . .” 
"They walked on for what seemed a long time, until they were once "
again so deep into the forest that 
the dense tree canopy blocked out all 
light. Harry had the feeling he had ha
"d before in the forest, one of be-"
ing watched by unseen eyes. . . . 
“How much further?” demanded Umbridge angrily from behind 
him. 
"“Not far now!” shouted Hermione, as they emerged into a dim, "
dank clearing. “Jus
t a little bit —” 
An arrow flew through the air and 
landed with a menacing thud in 
the tree just over her head. The air was suddenly full of the sound of 
hooves. Harry could feel the forest floor trembling; Umbridge gave a 
little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield — 
He wrenched himself free of her an
d turned. Around fifty centaurs 
"were emerging on every side, their bo"
"ws raised and loaded, pointing at "
"Harry, Hermione, and Umbridge, who "
backed slowly into the center 
"of the clearing, Umbridge uttering"
 odd little whimpers of terror. 
Harry looked sideways at Hermione. She was wearing a triumphant 
smile. 
 754 “Who are you?” said a voice. 
Harry looked left. The chestnut-b
odied centaur called Magorian 
"was walking toward them out of the circle; his bow, like the others’, "
"was raised. On Harry’s right, Um"
"bridge was still whimpering, her "
wand trembling violently as she poin
ted it at the advancing centaur. 
"“I asked you who are you, huma"
"n,” said Magorian roughly. "
“I am Dolores Umbridge!” said Um
"bridge in a high-pitched, terri-"
fied voice. “Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic and Head-
mistress and High Inquis
itor of Hogwarts!” 
“You are from the Ministry of Magi
"c?” said Magorian, as many of "
the centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly. 
“That’s right!” said Um
bridge in an even higher voice. “So be very 
careful! By the laws laid down by 
the Department for the Regulation 
"and Control of Magical Creatures, an"
y attack by half-breeds such as 
yourselves on a human —” 
“
What
 did you call us?” shouted a 
"wild-looking black centaur, "
whom Harry recognized as Bane. Th
ere was a great deal of angry mut-
tering and tightening of bowstrings around them. 
“Don’t call them that!” Hermione 
"said furiously, but Umbridge did "
not appear to have heard her. St
ill pointing her shaking wand at 
"Magorian, she continued, “Law Fift"
een B states clearly that ‘Any at-
tack by a magical creature who is 
deemed to have near-human intelli-
"gence, and therefore considered "
responsible for its actions —’” 
"“‘Near-human intelligence’?” repeated Magorian, as Bane and sev-"
eral others roared with rage and 
pawed the ground. “We consider that 
"a great insult, human! Our intelligence, thankfully, far outstrips your "
own —” 
“What are you doing in our forest?”
 bellowed the hard-faced gray 
centaur whom Harry and Hermione had 
seen on their last trip into 
the forest. “Why are you here?” 
“
Your
" forest?” said Umbridge, shakin"
g now not only with fright but 
"also, it seemed, with indignation. "
“I would remind you that you live 
   755 here only because the Ministry of 
Magic permits you certain areas of 
land —” 
An arrow flew so close to her head 
that it caught at her mousy hair 
in passing. She let out an earsplitti
ng scream and thre
w her hands over 
her head while some of the centaurs
 bellowed their approval and oth-
ers laughed raucously. The sound 
"of their wild, neighing laughter "
echoing around the dimly lit cleari
ng and the sight 
of their pawing 
hooves was extremely unnerving. 
"“Whose forest is it now, human?” bellowed Bane. "
“Filthy half-breeds!” she screamed
", her hands still tight over her "
head. “Beasts! Uncontrolled animals!” 
"“Be quiet!” shouted Hermione, bu"
t it was too late — Umbridge 
pointed her wand at Ma
"gorian and screamed, “"
Incarcerous
!” 
Ropes flew out of midair like th
"ick snakes, wrapping themselves "
tightly around the centaur’s torso an
d trapping his arms. He gave a cry 
of rage and reared onto 
"his hind legs, attempting"
" to free himself, while "
the other centaurs charged. 
Harry grabbed Hermione and pulled
 her to the ground. Facedown 
on the forest floor he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered 
"around him, but the centaurs leap"
"t over and around them, bellowing "
and screaming with rage. 
“Nooooo!” he heard Umbridge shri
ek. “Noooooo . . . I am Senior 
Undersecretary . . . you cannot . 
". . unhand me, you animals . . . "
nooooo!” 
He saw a flash of red light and knew that she had attempted to Stun 
one of them — then she screamed ve
ry loudly. Lifting his head a few 
"inches, Harry saw that Umbridge "
had been seized from behind by 
"Bane and lifted high into the air, "
wriggling and yelling with fright. 
Her wand fell from her hand to the 
"ground and Harry’s heart leapt, if "
he could just reach it — 
"But as he stretched out a hand toward it, a centaur’s hoof descended "
upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half. 
 756 “Now!” roared a voice in Harry’
s ear and a thick hairy arm de-
scended from thin air and dragge
d him upright; Hermione too had 
been pulled to her feet. Over th
"e plunging, many-colored backs and "
heads of the centaurs Harry saw Um
bridge being borne away through 
"the trees by Bane, still screaming no"
nstop; her voice grew fainter and 
fainter until they could no longer he
ar it over the trampling of hooves 
surrounding them. 
“And these?” said the hard-faced
", gray centaur holding Hermione. "
"“They are young,” said a slow, "
doleful voice from behind Harry. 
“We do not attack foals.” 
"“They brought her here, Ronan,” re"
plied the centaur who had such 
a firm grip on Harry. “And they are 
not so young. . . . He is nearing 
"manhood, this "
one. . . .” 
He shook Harry by the 
neck of his robes. 
"“Please,” said Hermione "
"breathlessly, “please, don’t attack us, we "
"don’t think like her, we aren’t Mi"
nistry of Magic employees! We only 
came in here because we hoped 
you’d drive her off for us —” 
Harry knew at once from the look 
on the face of the gray centaur 
holding Hermione that she had made a 
terrible mistake in saying this. 
The gray centaur threw back his he
"ad, his back legs stamping furi-"
"ously, and bellowed, “You see, Ro"
nan? They already have the arro-
gance of their kind! So we were 
"to do your dirty work, were we, "
"human girl? We were to act as your servants, drive away your enemies "
like obedient hounds?” 
“No!” said Hermione in a horrorstruck squeak. “Please — I didn’t 
mean that! I just ho
ped you’d be able to
 — to help us —” 
But she seemed to be going from bad to worse. 
“We do not help humans!” snar
"led the centaur holding Harry, "
tightening his grip and re
aring a little at the sa
"me time, so that Harry’s "
feet left the ground momentarily. 
“We are a race apart and proud to 
"be so. . . . We will not permit you to walk from here, boasting that we "
did your bidding!” 
   757 “We’re not going to say anything 
like that!” Harry shouted. “We 
know you didn’t do anything be
cause we wanted you to —” 
But nobody seemed to be listen
ing to him. A bearded centaur to-
"ward the back of the crowd shouted,"
" “They came here unasked, they "
must pay the consequences!” 
A roar of approval met these words and a dun-colored centaur 
"shouted, “They can join the woman!” "
“You said you didn’t hurt the in
"nocent!” shouted Hermione, real "
tears sliding down her face now. “We haven’t done anything to hurt 
"you, we haven’t used wands or threats, we just want to go back to "
"school, please let us go back —” "
“We are not all like the traitor Fi
"renze, human girl!” shouted the "
"gray centaur, to more neighing ro"
ars of approval from his fellows. 
“Perhaps you thought us pretty talk
ing horses? We are an ancient peo-
ple who will not stand wizard inva
sions and insults! We do not recog-
"nize your laws, we do not acknowle"
"dge your superiority, we are —” "
But they did not hear what else ce
"ntaurs were, for at that moment "
there came a crashing noise on the edge
 of the clearing so loud that all 
"of them — Harry, Hermione, and the "
fifty or so centaurs filling the 
clearing — looked around. Harry’s c
entaur let him fall to the ground 
again as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows; Hermione 
"had been dropped too, and Harry hurri"
ed toward her as two thick tree 
trunks parted ominously and the mo
nstrous form of Grawp the giant 
appeared in the gap. 
The centaurs nearest him backed 
into those behind. The clearing 
was now a forest of bows and arrows 
"waiting to be fired, all pointing "
upward at the enormous grayish fa
ce now looming over them from 
just beneath the thick canopy of 
branches. Grawp’s lopsided mouth 
was gaping stupidly. They could s
ee his bricklike yellow teeth glim-
"mering in the half-light, his dull sludge-colored eyes narrowed as he "
squinted down at the creatures at 
his feet. Broken ropes trailed from 
both ankles. 
 758 He opened his mouth even wider. 
“Hagger.” 
Harry did not know what “hagger” me
"ant, or what language it was "
"from, nor did he much care — he"
" was watching Grawp’s feet, which "
were almost as long as Harry’s wh
ole body. Hermione gripped his arm 
tightly; the centaurs were quite sile
"nt, staring up at the giant, whose "
"huge, round head moved from side to"
 side as he continued to peer 
amongst them as thou
gh looking for somet
hing he had dropped. 
“
Hagger
"!” he said again, more insistently. "
"“Get away from here, giant!” ca"
lled Magorian. “You are not wel-
come among us!” 
These words seemed to make no im
pression whatsoever on Grawp. 
He stooped a little (the centaurs’ ar
ms tensed on their bows) and then 
"bellowed, “HAGGER!” "
A few of the centaurs looked wo
"rried now. Hermione, however, "
gave a gasp. 
“Harry!” she whis
pered. “I think he’s trying to say ‘Hagrid’!” 
"At this precise moment Grawp caught sight of them, the only two "
humans in a sea of centaurs. He lo
"wered his head another foot or so, "
staring intently at 
them. Harry could feel 
Hermione shaking as 
"Grawp opened his mouth wide again and said, in a deep, rumbling "
"voice, “Hermy.” "
"“Goodness,” said Hermione, gripping"
 Harry’s arm so tightly it was 
growing numb and looking as though
" she was about to faint, “he — "
he remembered!” 
“HERMY!” roared Grawp. “WHERE HAGGER?” 
"“I don’t know!” squealed Hermione,"
" terrified. “I’m sorry, Grawp, I "
don’t know!” 
“ WANT HAGGER!” 
One of the giant’s massive ha
nds swooped down upon them — 
"Hermione let out a real scream, ran "
a few steps backward and fell over. 
"Wandless, Harry braced himself to punc"
"h, kick, bite, or whatever else "
   759 it took as the hand flew toward
 him and knocked a snow-white cen-
taur off his legs. 
It was what the centaurs had 
been waiting for — Grawp’s out-
stretched fingers were a foot from 
Harry when fifty arrows went soar-
"ing through the air at the giant, "
"peppering his enormous face, causing "
him to howl with pain and rage an
"d straighten up again, rubbing his "
"face with his enormous hands, breaking off the arrow shafts but forc-"
ing the heads in still deeper. 
He yelled and stamped his enormous feet and the centaurs scat-
tered out of the way. Pebble-sized droplets of Grawp’s blood showered 
Harry as he pulled Hermione to her feet and the pair of them ran as 
fast as they could for the shelter of
 the trees. Once there they looked 
back — Grawp was snatching blindly 
at the centaurs as blood ran all 
"down his face; they were retreating in disorder, galloping away "
through the trees on the other si
de of the clearing. As Harry and 
"Hermione watched, Grawp gave anot"
her roar of fury and plunged af-
"ter them, smashing more trees aside as he went. "
"“Oh no,” said Hermione, quaking so badly that her knees gave way. "
"“Oh, that was horrible. And he "
might kill them all. . . .” 
"“I’m not that fussed, to be honest,” said Harry bitterly. "
The sounds of the galloping cent
aurs and the blundering giant 
were growing fainter and fainter. As
 Harry listened to them his scar 
gave another great throb and a wa
ve of terror sw
ept over him. 
They had wasted so much time — they were even further from res-
cuing Sirius than they had been wh
en he had had the vision. Not only 
had Harry managed to lose his wand 
but they were stuck in the mid-
dle of the Forbidden Forest with 
no means of transport whatsoever. 
"“Smart plan,” he spat at Hermione, keen to release some of his fury. "
“Really smart plan. Where 
do we go from here?” 
“We need to get back up to the 
"castle,” said Hermione faintly. "
"“By the time we’ve done that, Siri"
us’ll probably be dead!” said 
"Harry, kicking a nearby"
 tree in temper; there was a high-pitched 
 760 chattering overhead and he looked up
 to see an angry bowtruckle flex-
ing its long twiglike fingers at him. 
"“Well, we can’t do anything with"
"out wands,” said Hermione hope-"
"lessly, dragging herself up again."
" “Anyway, Harry, how exactly were "
you planning to get all the way to London?” 
"“Yeah, we were just wondering that"
",” said a familiar voice from be-"
hind her. 
"Harry and Hermione moved instinctively together, peering through "
"the trees, as Ron came into sight, with Ginny, Neville, and Luna hur-"
rying along behind him. 
All of them looked 
a little the worse for 
wear — there were several long 
scratches running the length of 
"Ginny’s cheek, a large purple lump was swelling above Neville’s right "
"eye, Ron’s lip was bleeding worse th"
an ever — but all were looking 
rather pleased with themselves. 
"“So,” said Ron, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding "
"out Harry’s wand, “had any ideas?” "
“How did you get away?” asked 
Harry in amazemen
"t, taking his "
wand from Ron. 
"“Couple of Stunners, a Disarming "
"Charm, Neville brought off a re-"
"ally nice little Impediment Jinx,”"
" said Ron airily, now handing back "
"Hermione’s wand too. “But Ginny was best, she got Malfoy — Bat-"
"Bogey Hex — it was superb, his whol"
e face was covered in the great 
"flapping things. Anyway, we saw you "
heading into the fo
rest out of the 
window and followed. What’v
e you done with Umbridge?” 
"“She got carried away,” said Ha"
rry. “By a herd of centaurs.” 
"“And they left you behind?” asked Ginny, looking astonished. "
"“No, they got chased off "
"by Grawp,” said Harry. "
“Who’s Grawp?” Luna asked interestedly. 
"“Hagrid’s little brother,” said Ro"
"n promptly. “Anyway, never mind "
"that now. Harry, what did you find"
 out in the fire? Has You-Know-
Who got Sirius or — ?” 
"“Yes,” said Harry, as his scar gave"
" another painful prickle, “and I’m "
   761 "sure Sirius is still alive, but I can’"
t see how we’re going to get there to 
help him.” 
"They all fell silent, looking rather"
 scared. The problem facing them 
seemed insurmountable. 
"“Well, we’ll have to fly, won’t we?”"
 said Luna in the closest thing to 
a matter-of-fact voice Harry 
had ever heard her use. 
"“Okay,” said Harry irritably, rounding"
" on her, “first of all, ‘we’ "
aren’t doing anything if you’re incl
"uding yourself in that, and second "
"of all, Ron’s the only one with a broomstick that isn’t being guarded by "
"a security troll, so —” "
“I’ve got a broom!” said Ginny. 
"“Yeah, but you’re not comi"
"ng,” said Ron angrily. "
"“Excuse me, but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do!” "
"said Ginny, her jaw set so that he"
r resemblance to Fred and George 
was suddenly striking. 
“You’re too —” Harry began. 
“I’m three years older than you were when you fought You-Know-
"Who over the Sorcerer’s Stone,” she said fiercely, “and it’s because of "
me Malfoy’s stuck back in Umbridge’s
 office with giant flying bogeys 
attacking him —” 
"“Yeah, but —” "
"“We were all in the D.A. together,” "
said Neville quietly. “It was all 
supposed to be about fighting You-
"Know-Who, wasn’t it? And this is "
the first chance we’ve had to do something real — or was that all just 
a game or something?” 
“No — of course it wasn’t —” said Harry impatiently. 
"“Then we should come too,” said Neville simply. “We want to help.” "
"“That’s right,” said Lu"
"na, smiling happily. "
Harry’s eyes met Ron’s. He knew 
that Ron was thinking exactly 
what he was: If he could have ch
osen any members of the D.A. in ad-
"dition to himself, Ron, and Hermione to join him in the attempt to "
"rescue Sirius, he would not have "
"picked Ginny, Neville, or Luna. "
 762 "“Well, it doesn’t matter anyway,” "
"said Harry frustratedly, “because "
we still don’t know how to get there —” 
“I thought we’d settled that?” 
said Luna maddeningly. “We’re 
flying!” 
"“Look,” said Ron, barely containing"
" his anger, “you might be able "
to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us can’t sprout wings when-
ever we —” 
“There are other ways of flying th
"an with broomsticks,” said Luna "
serenely. 
“I s’pose we’re going to ride on 
the back of the Kacky Snorgle or 
whatever it is?” Ron demanded. 
"“The Crumple-Horned Snorkack can’t fly,” said Luna in a dignified "
"voice, “but "
they
" can, and Hagrid says th"
ey’re very good at finding 
places their riders are looking for.” 
Harry whirled around. Standing 
between two tree
"s, their white "
"eyes gleaming eerily, were two thestrals, watching the whispered con-"
versation as though they
 understood every word. 
"“Yes!” he whispered, moving toward them. They tossed their reptil-"
"ian heads, throwing back long bl"
"ack manes, and Harry stretched out "
his hand eagerly and patted the neare
st one’s shining neck. How could 
he ever have thought them ugly? 
“Is it those mad horse things?” sa
"id Ron uncertainly, staring at a "
point slightly to the left of the th
estral Harry was patting. “Those ones 
you can’t see unless you’ve 
watched someone snuff it?” 
"“Yeah,” said Harry. "
“How many?” 
“Just two.” 
"“Well, we need three,"
"” said Hermione, who was still looking a lit-"
"tle shaken, but determ"
ined just the same. 
"“Four, Hermione,” sa"
"id Ginny, scowling. "
"“I think there are six of us, actually,” said Luna calmly, counting. "
"“Don’t be stupid, we can’t all go"
"!” said Harry angrily. “Look, you "
   763 "three” — he pointed at Neville, Ginny, and Luna — “you’re not in-"
"volved in this, you’re not —” "
They burst into more protests. His 
"scar gave another, more painful, "
twinge. Every moment they delayed was precious; he did not have 
time to argue. 
"“Okay, fine, it’s your choice,” he sa"
id curtly. “But unless we can find 
more thestrals you’re not going to be able —” 
"“Oh, more of them will come,” "
"said Ginny confidently, who like "
Ron was squinting in quite the wron
"g direction, apparently under the "
impression that she was looking at the horses. 
“What makes you think that?” 
"“Because in case you hadn’t noticed, you and Hermione are both "
"covered in blood,” she said coolly, "
“and we know Hagrid lures thes-
"trals with raw meat, so that’s probably why these two turned up in the "
first place. . . .” 
Harry felt a soft tug on his robes 
at that moment and looked down 
to see the closest thestral lickin
"g his sleeve, which was damp with "
Grawp’s blood. 
"“Okay, then,” he said, a bright idea occurring. “Ron and I will take "
"these two and go ahead, and Hermio"
ne can stay here with you three 
and she’ll attract 
more thestrals —” 
“I’m not staying behind!” 
said Hermione
 furiously. 
"“There’s no need,” said Luna, smiling. “Look, here come more "
now. . . . You two must 
really smell. . . .” 
Harry turned. No fewer than six or seven thestrals were picking 
"their way through the trees now, th"
eir great leathery wings folded 
"tight to their bodies, their eyes "
gleaming through the darkness. He 
had no excuse now. . . . 
"“All right,” he said angrily, “pick one and get on, then.” "
Harry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest 
"thestral, placed a foot on "
"a stump nearby, and scrambled "
clumsily onto the horse’s silken back
". It did not object, but twisted its "
"head around, fangs bared, and attemp"
ted to continue its eager licking 
of his robes. 
He found there was a way of lodg
ing his knees behind the wing 
joints that made him feel more se
cure and looked around at the oth-
ers. Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next thestral and 
was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature’s back. 
"Luna was already in place, sitting "
sidesaddle and adjust
ing her robes as 
though she did this every day. Ro
"n, Hermione, and Ginny, however, "
were still standing motionless on 
"the spot, openmouthed and staring. "
“What?” he said. 
“How’re we supposed to get on?” 
said Ron faintly. “When we can’t 
see the things?” 
"“Oh it’s easy,” said Luna, sliding "
obligingly from her thestral and 
"marching over to him, Hermione, and Ginny. “Come here. . . .” "
H 
   765 She pulled them over to the othe
r thestrals standing around and 
one by one managed to help them on
to the backs of their mounts. All 
three looked extremely nervous as
 she wound their hands into the 
horses’ manes and told them to grip
 tightly before getting back onto 
her own steed. 
"“This is mad,” Ron said faintly, "
moving his free hand gingerly up 
and down his horse’s neck. “Mad . 
. . if I could just see it —” 
"“You’d better hope it stays invisible,” said Harry darkly. “We all "
"ready, then?” "
They all nodded and he saw five 
pairs of knees tighten beneath 
their robes. 
“Okay . . .” 
He looked down at the back of his 
thestral’s glossy black head and 
"swallowed. “Ministry of Magic, vi"
"sitors’ entrance, London, then,” he "
said uncertainly. “Er 
. . . if you know . . 
. where to go . . .” 
For a moment his thestral did not
"hing at all. Then, with a sweep-"
ing movement that nearly unseated 
"him, the wings on either side ex-"
"tended, the horse crouched slowly and then rocketed upward so fast "
and so steeply that Harry had to cl
ench his arms and legs tightly 
around the horse to avoid sliding 
backward over its bony rump. He 
closed his eyes and put his face down into the horse’s silky mane as 
they burst through the topmost bran
ches of the trees and soared out 
into a bloodred sunset. 
Harry did not think he had ever 
moved so fast: The thestral 
"streaked over the castle, its wide wi"
ngs hardly beating. The cooling air 
"was slapping Harry’s face; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind, "
he looked around and saw his five 
"fellows soaring along behind him, "
each of them bent as low as possibl
e into the neck of their thestral to 
protect themselves from its slipstream. 
"They were over the Hogwarts grounds, they had passed Hogs-"
meade. Harry could see mountains 
and gullies below them. In the  
 766 falling darkness Harry saw small collec
tions of lights as they passed 
"over more villages, then a windin"
g road on which a single car was 
beetling its way home th
rough the hills. . . . 
“This is bizarre!” Harry heard Ron yell from somewhere behind 
"him, and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this "
height with no visible 
means of support. . . . 
"Twilight fell: The sky turned to a light, dusky purple littered with "
"tiny silver stars, and soon it was only the lights of Muggle towns that "
gave them any clue of how far from
 the ground they were or how very 
fast they were travelin
g. Harry’s arms were wr
apped tightly around his 
horse’s neck as he willed it to 
go even faster. How much time had 
elapsed since he had seen Sirius ly
ing on the Department of Mysteries 
floor? How much longer would he be able to resist Voldemort? All 
Harry knew for sure was that Siri
us had neither done as Voldemort 
"wanted, nor died, for he was conv"
inced that either outcome would 
cause him to feel Voldemort’s jubila
tion or fury course through his 
"own body, making his scar sear as pa"
infully as it had 
on the night Mr. 
Weasley was attacked. . . . 
On they flew through the gatherin
g darkness; Harry’s face felt stiff 
"and cold, his legs numb from gripping the thestral’s sides so tightly, "
but he did not dare shift positions le
st he slip. . . . He was deaf from 
the thundering in his ears and his
 mouth was dry and frozen from the 
rush of cold night air. He had lost
 all sense of how far they had come; 
"all his faith was in the beast below him, still streaking purposefully "
"through the night, barely flapping its "
wings as it sped ever onward. . . . 
If they were too late . . . 
"He’s still alive, he’s sti"
"ll fighting, I can feel it."
 . . . 
If Voldemort decided Sirius was not going to crack . . . 
I’d know.
 . . . 
Harry’s stomach gave a jolt. The thestral’s head was suddenly point-
ing toward the ground and he had ac
tually slid forward a few inches 
along its neck. They were descending at last. . . . He heard one of the 
   767 girls shriek behind him and twiste
d around dangerously but could see 
no sign of a falling body. . . . Pr
esumably they had received a shock 
from the change of position
", just as he had. . . . "
And now bright orange lights were
 growing larger and rounder on 
"all sides. They could see the tops of buildings, streams of headlights "
"like luminous insect eyes, squares of pale yellow that were windows. "
"Quite suddenly, it seemed, they we"
re hurtling toward the pavement. 
Harry gripped the thestr
al with every last ou
"nce of his strength, "
"braced for a sudden impact, but the "
horse touched the dark ground as 
lightly as a shadow and Harry slid 
"from his back, looking around at "
the street where the ov
erflowing dumpster stil
l stood a short way from 
the vandalized telephone 
"box, both drained of co"
lor in the flat orange 
glare of the streetlights. 
Ron landed a short way away and 
toppled immediately off his thes-
tral onto the pavement. 
"“Never again,” he said, struggling "
to his feet. He made as though to 
"stride away from his thestral, but, unable to see it, collided with its "
hindquarters and almost fell over agai
"n. “Never, ever again . . . that "
was the worst —” 
Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him. Both 
slid off their mounts a little more
" gracefully than Ron, though with "
similar expressions of relief at be
ing back on firm ground. Neville 
"jumped down, shaking, but "
Luna dismount
ed smoothly. 
"“Where do we go from here, then?”"
 she asked Harry in a politely 
"interested voice, as though this was all a rather interesting day-trip. "
"“Over here,” he said. He gave his th"
"estral a quick, grateful pat, then "
led the way quickly to the batter
ed telephone box and opened the 
door. “Come 
on
!” he urged the others
 as they hesitated. 
"Ron and Ginny marched in obediently; Hermione, Neville, and "
Luna squashed themselves in after 
them; Harry took 
one glance back 
"at the thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the "
"dumpster, then forced himsel"
f into the box after Luna. 
 768 "“Whoever’s nearest the receiver, dial"
 six two four four two!” he said. 
"Ron did it, his arm bent bizarrely "
to reach the dial. As it whirred 
back into place the cool female vo
"ice sounded inside the box, “Wel-"
come to the Ministry of Magic. Pl
ease state your name and business.” 
"“Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger,” Harry said very "
"quickly, “Ginny Weasley, Nevill"
"e Longbottom, Luna Lovegood . . . "
"We’re here to save someone, unless"
 your Ministry can do it first!” 
"“Thank you,” said the cool female vo"
"ice. “Visitors, please take the "
badges and attach 
them to the front of your robes.” 
Half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned 
coins usually appeared. Hermione scooped them up and handed them 
mutely to Harry over Ginny’s head; 
he glanced at the topmost one. 
HARRY POTTER 
rescue mission 
"“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and "
present your wand for registration 
"at the security desk, which is lo-"
cated at the far end of the Atrium.” 
"“Fine!” Harry said loudly, as his sc"
ar gave another throb. “Now can 
we 
move
?” 
The floor of the telephone box sh
uddered and the pavement rose 
up past the glass windows of the 
telephone box. The scavenging thes-
"trals were sliding out of sight, blackness closed over their heads, and "
with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Min-
istry of Magic. 
A chink of soft golden light hit 
"their feet and, widening, rose up "
their bodies. Harry bent 
his knees and held his 
wand as ready as he 
"could in such cramped conditions, peering through the glass to see "
"whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed "
to be completely empty. The ligh
t was dimmer than it had been by 
day. There were no fires burning un
der the mantelpieces set into the 
   769 "walls, but he saw as the lift slid sm"
oothly to a halt that golden symbols 
continued to twist sinuously 
in the dark blue ceiling. 
"“The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening,” said the "
woman’s voice. 
The door of the teleph
one box burst 
open; Harry toppled out of 
"it, followed by Neville and Luna. "
The only sound in the Atrium was 
the steady rush of wate
"r from the golden fountain, where jets from the "
"wands of the witch and wizard, the point of the centaur’s arrow, the "
"tip of the goblin’s hat, and the hous"
e-elf’s ears continued to gush into 
the surrounding pool. 
"“Come on,” said Harry quietly an"
d the six of them sprinted off 
"down the hall, Harry in the lead, pa"
"st the fountain, toward the desk "
where the security man who had weighed Harry’s wand had sat and 
which was now deserted. 
Harry felt sure that there ought to 
"be a security person there, sure "
that their absence was an ominous si
"gn, and his feeling of foreboding "
increased as they passed through th
e golden gates to the lifts. He 
pressed the nearest down button and a lift clattered into sight almost 
"immediately, the golden grilles slid"
" apart with a great, echoing clank-"
"ing, and they dashed inside. Harr"
"y stabbed the number nine button, "
"the grilles closed with a bang, and th"
"e lift began to descend, jangling "
and rattling. Harry had not realized 
how noisy the lifts were on the 
day that he had come with Mr. Weasley — he was sure that the din 
would raise every security person 
within the buildi
"ng, yet when the "
"lift halted, the cool female voice "
"said, “Department of Mysteries,” and "
"the grilles slid open again, they stepped out into the corridor where "
nothing was moving but th
"e nearest torches, flicke"
ring in the rush of 
air from the lift. 
Harry turned toward the plain 
black door. After months and 
"months of dreaming about it, "
he was here at
 last. . . . 
"“Let’s go,” he whispered, and "
"he led the way down the corridor, "
"Luna right behind him, gazing arou"
nd with her mouth slightly open. 
 770 "“Okay, listen,” said Harry, stopping"
 again within six feet of the 
door. “Maybe . . . maybe a 
couple of people shou
ld stay here as a — 
"as a lookout, and —” "
“And how’re we going to let you 
know something’s coming?” asked 
"Ginny, her eyebrows"
 raised. “You coul
d be miles away.” 
"“We’re coming with you,"
" Harry,” said Neville. "
“Let’s get on with it
",” said Ron firmly. "
Harry still did not want to take them
" all with him, bu"
t it seemed he 
had no choice. He turned to face th
e door and walked forward. Just as 
"it had in his dream, it swung open"
" and he marched forward, leading "
the others over the threshold. 
"They were standing in a large, "
circular room. Everything in here 
was black including the floor and 
"ceiling — identical, unmarked, "
handle-less black doors were set at in
tervals all around 
"the black walls, "
"interspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue, their "
"cool, shimmering light reflected in th"
e shining marble floor so that it 
looked as though there was dark water underfoot. 
"“Someone shut the door,” Harry muttered. "
He regretted giving this order th
e moment Neville had obeyed it. 
Without the long chink of light from the torch-lit corridor behind 
"them, the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they "
could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and 
their ghostly reflection
s in the floor below. 
"In his dream, Harry had always "
walked purposefully across this 
room to the door immediately oppo
site the entrance and walked on. 
But there were around a dozen doors he
re. Just as he was gazing ahead 
"at the doors opposite him, trying to"
" decide which was the right one, "
there was a great rumbling noise an
d the candles began to move side-
ways. The circular 
wall was rotating. 
Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm as though frightened the floor 
"might move too, but it did not. "
For a few seconds 
the blue flames 
around them were blurred to rese
mble neon lines as the wall sped 
   771 "around and then, quite as suddenly as it had started, the rumbling "
stopped and everything became
 stationary once again. 
Harry’s eyes had blue streaks burned
 into them; it was all he could 
see. 
“What was that about?” wh
ispered Ron fearfully. 
“I think it was to stop us know
"ing which door we came in from,” "
said Ginny in a hushed voice. 
Harry realized at once that she was 
right: He could no sooner have 
picked the exit from the other doors than located an ant upon the jet-
"black floor. Meanwhile, the door th"
rough which they needed to pro-
ceed could be any of th
e dozen surrounding them. 
“How’re we going to get back ou
t?” said Neville uncomfortably. 
"“Well, that doesn’t matter now,” sa"
"id Harry forcefully, blinking to "
"try and erase the blue lines from his vision, and clutching his wand "
tighter than ever. “We won’t need to 
get out till we’ve found Sirius —” 
"“Don’t go calling for him, though"
"!” Hermione said urgently, but "
Harry had never needed her advice less; his instinct was to keep as 
quiet as possible fo
r the time being. 
"“Where do we go, then, Harry?” Ron asked. "
“I don’t —” Harry began. He swa
llowed. “In the dreams I went 
through the door at the end of the co
rridor from the lifts into a dark 
room — that’s this one — and then
 I went through another door into 
a room that kind of . . . glitters. 
"We should try a few doors,” he said "
hastily. “I’ll know
 the right way when I see it. C’mon.” 
He marched straight at the door no
"w facing him, the others follow-"
"ing close behind him, set his left hand against its cool, shining surface, "
"raised his wand, ready to strike th"
"e moment it opened, and pushed. It "
swung open easily. 
"After the darkness of the first room, the lamps hanging low on "
golden chains from this ceiling gave 
the impression that this long rec-
tangular room was much
" brighter, though ther"
"e were no glittering, "
shimmering lights such as Harry 
had seen in his dreams. The place 
 772 was quite empty except for a few de
"sks and, in the very middle of the "
"room, an enormous glass tank of d"
"eep-green water, big enough for all "
"of them to swim in, which contained a number of pearly white objects "
that were drifting around
 lazily in the liquid. 
“What’re those things
?” whispered Ron. 
"“Dunno,” said Harry. "
“Are they fish?” breathed Ginny. 
“Aquavirius maggots!” said Luna ex
citedly. “Dad said the Ministry 
were breeding —” 
"“No,” said Hermione. She sounde"
d odd. She moved forward to 
look through the side of the tank. “They’re brains.” 
“
Brains
?” 
“Yes . . . I wonder what 
they’re doing with them?” 
"Harry joined her at the tank. Sure enough, there could be no mis-"
take now that he saw them at clos
e quarters. Glimmering eerily they 
"drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green water, looking "
something like slimy cauliflowers. 
"“Let’s get out of here,” said Harry."
" “This isn’t right, we need to try "
another door —” 
"“There are doors here too,” said "
"Ron, pointing around the walls. "
Harry’s heart sank; how 
big was this place? 
“In my dream I went through that 
"dark room into the second one,” "
he said. “I think we should go back and try from there.” 
So they hurried back into the 
"dark, circular room; the ghostly "
shapes of the brains were now sw
imming before Harry’s eyes instead 
of the blue candle flames. 
"“Wait!” said Hermione sharply, as"
 Luna made to close the door of 
the brain room behind them. “
Flagrate
!” 
She drew with her wand in midair and a fiery X appeared on the 
door. No sooner had the door clicke
d shut behind them than there 
"was a great rumbling, and once ag"
ain the wall began 
to revolve very 
"fast, but now there was a great red-go"
"ld blur in amongst the faint blue, "
   773 "and when all became still again, th"
"e fiery cross still burned, showing "
the door they had already tried. 
"“Good thinking,” said Harry. "
"“Okay, let’s try this one —” "
Again he strode directly at the door
" facing him and pushed it open, "
"his wand still raised, th"
e others at his heels. 
"This room was larger than the last, dimly lit and rectangular, and the "
"center of it was sunken, forming a "
great stone pit some twenty feet be-
low them. They were standing on th
e topmost tier of what seemed to 
be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep 
"steps like an amphitheater, or the courtroom in which Harry had been "
tried by the Wizengamot. 
"Instead of a chained chair, however, there was "
a raised stone dais in the center of 
"the lowered floor, and upon this dais "
stood a stone archway that
" looked so ancient, "
"cracked, and crumbling "
that Harry was amazed the thing wa
s still standing. Unsupported by 
"any surrounding wall, the archway was hung with a tattered black cur-"
"tain or veil which, despite the comp"
lete stillness of the cold surround-
"ing air, was fluttering very slightly as"
 though it had just been touched. 
"“Who’s there?” said Harry, jumping down onto the bench below. "
There was no answering vo
"ice, but the veil continued to flutter and sway. "
“Careful!” whispered Hermione. 
Harry scrambled down the benches o
ne by one until he reached the 
stone bottom of the sunken pit. Hi
s footsteps echoed loudly as he 
walked slowly toward the dais. 
The pointed archway looked much 
taller from where he stood now th
an when he had been looking down 
on it from above. Still the veil sw
"ayed gently, as though somebody had "
just passed through it. 
"“Sirius?” Harry spoke again, but mu"
ch more quietly now that he 
was nearer. 
He had the strangest feeling that 
there was someone standing right 
behind the veil on the other side of the archway. Gripping his wand 
"very tightly, he edged around the dais, but there was nobody there. All "
that could be seen was the other 
side of the tattered black veil. 
 774 "“Let’s go,” called Hermione from "
halfway up the stone steps. “This 
"isn’t right, Harry, come"
" on, let’s go. . . .” "
"She sounded scared, much more sc"
ared than she had in the room 
"where the brains swam, yet Harry thought the archway had a kind of "
"beauty about it, old though it was. The gently rippling veil intrigued "
him; he felt a very strong inclination 
to climb up on the dais and walk 
through it. 
"“Harry, let’s go, okay?” said"
 Hermione more forcefully. 
"“Okay,” he said, but he did not "
move. He had just heard some-
thing. There were faint whispering
", murmuring noises coming from "
the other side of the veil. 
“What are you saying?” he said 
"very loudly, so that the words "
echoed all around the su
rrounding stone benches. 
"“Nobody’s talking, Harry!” said "
"Hermione, now moving over to "
him. 
“Someone’s whispering behind ther
"e,” he said, moving out of her "
reach and continuing to frown at
" the veil. “Is that you, Ron?” "
"“I’m here, mate,” said Ron, appear"
ing around the side of the arch-
way. 
"“Can’t anyone else hear it?” Harry demanded, for the whispering "
and murmuring was becoming louder; without really meaning to put 
"it there, he found his "
foot was on the dais. 
"“I can hear them too,” breathed Luna, joining them around the "
side of the archway and 
gazing at the swaying veil. “There are people 
in there
!” 
"“What do you mean, ‘"
in there
"’?” demanded Hermione, jumping "
down from the bottom step and soun
ding much angrier than the oc-
casion warranted. “There isn’t any ‘
"in there,"
"’ it’s just an archway, there’s "
"no room for anybody to be there — Harry, stop it, come away —” "
"She grabbed his arm and pulled, but he resisted. "
"“Harry, we are supposed to be here for Sirius!” she said in a high-"
"pitched, strained voice. "
   775 "“Sirius,” Harry repeated, still gazing, mesmerized, at the continu-"
ously swaying veil
. “Yeah . . .” 
"And then something slid back into place in his brain: Sirius, cap-"
"tured, bound, and tortured, and he was staring at this archway. . . . "
He took several paces back from
 the dais and wrenched his eyes 
from the veil. 
"“Let’s go,” he said. "
"“That’s what I’ve been trying to — well, come on, then!” said "
"Hermione, and she led the way back"
 around the dais. On the other 
"side, Ginny and Neville were staring, apparently entranced, at the veil "
"too. Without speaking, Hermione "
"took hold of Ginny’s arm, Ron "
"Neville’s, and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone "
bench and clambered all the 
way back up to the door. 
“What d’you reckon that arch wa
s?” Harry asked Hermione as they 
regained the dark circular room. 
"“I don’t know, but whatever it wa"
"s, it was dangerous,” she said "
"firmly, again inscribing a "
fiery cross upon the door. 
Once more the wall spun and became still again. Harry approached 
a door at random and pu
shed. It did not move. 
“What’s wrong?” said Hermione. 
"“It’s . . . locked . . .” said Harry,"
" throwing his weight at the door, "
but it did not budge. 
"“This is it, then, isn’t it?” said Ron excitedly, joining Harry in the "
attempt to force the door
 open. “Bound to be!” 
“Get out of the way!” said Hermione sharply. She pointed her 
wand at the place where a lock wo
uld have been on an ordinary door 
"and said, “"
Alohomora
!” 
Nothing happened. 
"“Sirius’s knife!” said Harry, and he"
 pulled it out from inside his 
robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall. The 
others all watched eagerly as he ra
"n it from top to bottom, withdrew "
"it, and then flung his shoulder again "
at the door. It remained as firmly 
 776 "shut as ever. What was more, when"
" Harry looked down at the knife, "
he saw that the 
blade had melted. 
"“Right, we’re leaving that room"
",” said Hermione decisively. "
“But what if that’s the one?” said 
"Ron, staring at it with a mixture "
of apprehension and longing. 
"“It can’t be, Harry could get thro"
"ugh all the doors in his dream,” "
"said Hermione, marking the door with"
 another fiery cross as Harry re-
placed the now-useless handle of
 Sirius’s knife in his pocket. 
"“You know what could be in there?” said Luna eagerly, as the wall "
started to spin yet again. 
"“Something blibbering, no doubt,” said Hermione under her "
"breath, and Neville gave "
a nervous little laugh. 
The wall slid back to a halt and Ha
"rry, with a feelin"
g of increasing 
"desperation, pushed "
the next door open. 
“
This is it
!” 
He knew it at once by the beau
"tiful, dancing, diamond-sparkling "
light. As Harry’s eyes became more 
accustomed to th
e brilliant glare 
"he saw clocks gleaming from every surface, large and small, grandfa-"
"ther and carriage, hanging in spaces between the bookcases or stand-"
ing on desks ranging the length of th
"e room, so that a busy, relentless "
ticking filled the place like thousa
"nds of minuscule, marching foot-"
"steps. The source of the dancing, "
diamond-bright light was a towering 
crystal bell jar that stood 
at the far end of the room. 
“This way!” 
Harry’s heart was pumping franticall
y now that he knew they were 
on the right track. He led the wa
y forward down the narrow space be-
tween the lines of the de
"sks, heading, as he had done in his dream, for "
"the source of the light, the crystal be"
ll jar quite as tall as he was that 
stood on a desk and appear
ed to be full of a 
"billowing, glittering "
wind. 
“Oh 
look
"!” said Ginny, as they drew "
"nearer, pointing at the very "
heart of the bell jar. 
   777 Drifting along in the sparkling 
"current inside was a tiny, jewel-"
bright egg. As it rose in the ja
r it cracked open and a hummingbird 
"emerged, which was carried to the very top of the jar, but as it fell on "
"the draft, its feathers became bedrag"
"gled and damp again, and by the "
time it had been borne back to th
e bottom of the ja
r it had been en-
closed once more in its egg. 
"“Keep going!” said Harry sharply, "
because Ginny showed signs of 
wanting to stop and wa
tch the egg’s progress back into a bird. 
“You dawdled enough by that old ar
"ch!” she said crossly, but fol-"
lowed him past the bell jar 
to the only door behind it. 
"“This is it,” Harry said again, "
and his heart was now pumping so 
hard and fast he felt it must inte
rfere with his speech. “It’s through 
here —” 
He glanced around at them all. They had their wands out and 
looked suddenly serious and anxious. He looked back at the door 
and pushed. It swung open. 
"They were there, they had found "
the place: high as a church and 
"full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small, dusty, glass orbs. "
They glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle brackets 
set at intervals along the shelves. Like those in the circular room be-
"hind them, their flames were burn"
ing blue. The room was very cold. 
Harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles 
between two rows of shelves. He co
uld not hear anything nor see the 
slightest sign of movement. 
"“You said it was row ninety-seven,” whispered Hermione. "
"“Yeah,” breathed Harry, looking up"
 at the end of the closest row. 
Beneath the branch of blue-glowing 
candles protruding from it glim-
mered the silver figure 53. 
"“We need to go right, I think,” "
"whispered Hermione, squinting to "
the next row. “Yes . . . 
that’s fifty-four. . . .” 
"“Keep your wands out,"
” Harry said softly. 
"They crept forward, staring behind "
them as they went on down the 
 778 "long alleys of shelves, the farthe"
r ends of which were in near total 
"darkness. Tiny, yellowing labels ha"
d been stuck beneath each glass orb 
on the shelf. Some of them had a we
"ird, liquid glow; others were as "
dull and dark within 
as blown lightbulbs. 
They passed row eighty-four . . . 
eighty-five . . . Harry was listen-
"ing hard for the slightest sound of movement, but Sirius might be "
"gagged now, or else unconscious . . . "
"or,"
 said an unbidden voice inside 
"his head, "
he might already be dead.
 . . . 
"I’d have felt it,"
" he told himself, his hear"
t now hammering against his 
Adam’s apple. 
I’d already know.
 . . . 
“Ninety-seven!” whispered Hermione. 
"They stood grouped around the end of the row, gazing down the "
alley beside it. Ther
e was nobody there. 
"“He’s right down at the end,” sa"
"id Harry, whose mouth had be-"
come slightly dry. “You can’t 
see properly from
 here. . . .” 
"And he led them forward, between th"
e towering rows 
"of glass balls, "
some of which glowed softly as they passed. . . . 
"“He should be near here,” whispe"
"red Harry, convinced that every "
step was going to bring the ragged form of Sirius into view upon the 
darkened floor. “Anywhere here
 . . . really close . . .” 
“Harry?” said Hermione tentativel
"y, but he did not want to re-"
spond. His mouth was very dry now. 
“Somewhere about . . . 
here . . .” he said. 
They had reached the end of the 
row and emerged into more dim 
candlelight. There was nobody ther
"e at all. All was echoing, dusty "
silence. 
“He might be . . .” Harry whispe
"red hoarsely, peering down the "
alley next door. “Or maybe . . .” 
He hurried to look down the one 
beyond that. 
“Harry?” said Hermione again. 
“What?” he snarled. 
   779 “I . . . I don’t thin
k Sirius is here.” 
Nobody spoke. Harry did not want to
 look at any of them. He felt 
sick. He did not understand why Si
rius was not here. He had to be 
"here. This was where he, Ha"
"rry, had seen him. . . . "
"He ran up the space at the end of the rows, staring down them. "
Empty aisle after empty 
"aisle flickered past. He ran the other way, "
back past his staring companions. 
There was no sign of Sirius any-
"where, nor any hint"
 of a struggle. 
“Harry?” Ron called. 
“What?” 
He did not want to hear
" what Ron had to say, "
did not want to hear 
"Ron tell him he had been stupid, or suggest that they ought to go back "
to Hogwarts. But the heat was rising in his face and he felt as though 
he would like to skulk down here in
 the darkness for a long while be-
fore facing the brightness of the 
Atrium above and the others’ accus-
ing stares. . . . 
“Have you seen th
is?” said Ron. 
"“What?” said Harry, but eagerly this "
time — it had to be a sign that 
"Sirius had been there, a clue — he st"
rode back to where they were all 
"standing, a little way down row ni"
"nety-seven, but found nothing ex-"
cept Ron staring at one of the du
sty glass spheres on the shelves. 
“What?” Harry repeated glumly. 
"“It’s — it’s got your name on,” said Ron. "
Harry moved a little closer. Ron was pointing at one of the small 
"glass spheres that glowed with a dull inner light, though it was very "
dusty and appeared no
t to have been touched for many years. 
“My name?” said Harry blankly. 
He stepped forward. Not as tall as 
"Ron, he had to "
crane his neck to 
read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty 
glass ball. In spidery writing was wr
itten a date of so
me sixteen years 
"previously, and below that: "
 780 S. P. T. to  A. P. W. B. D. 
Dark  Lord 
and (?) Harry Potter 
Harry stared at it. 
“What is it?” Ron aske
"d, sounding unnerved. “What’s your name "
doing down here?” 
He glanced along at the other labe
ls on that stre
tch of shelf. 
"“I’m not here,” he said, sounding pe"
rplexed. “None of the rest of us 
are here. . . .” 
"“Harry, I don’t think you should touch it,” said Hermione sharply, "
as he stretched out his hand. 
"“Why not?” he said. “It’s something to do with me, isn’t it?” "
"“Don’t, Harry,” said Neville sudd"
enly. Harry looked around at 
him. Neville’s round face was shining 
slightly with sweat. He looked 
as though he could not ta
ke much more suspense. 
"“It’s got my name on,” said Harry. "
"And feeling slightly reckless, he closed his fingers around the dusty "
ball’s surface. He had expected it to
" feel cold, but it did not. On the "
"contrary, it felt as though it had b"
"een lying in the sun for hours, as "
"though the glow of light within was warming it. Expecting, even hop-"
"ing, that something dramatic was "
"going to happen, something excit-"
ing that might make their long and dangerous journey worthwhile 
"after all, he lifted the glass ball do"
wn from its shelf and stared at it. 
Nothing whatsoever happened. The ot
hers moved in closer around 
"Harry, gazing at the orb as he brushed it free of the clogging dust. "
"And then, from right behind them"
", a drawling voice said, “Very "
"good, Potter. Now turn around, nice "
"and slowly, and give"
 that to me.” 
lack shapes were emerging out of
" thin air all around them, block-"
"ing their way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a "
dozen lit wand tips were
 pointing directly at 
their hearts. Ginny gave 
a gasp of horror. 
"“To me, Potter,” repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he "
"held out his hand, palm up. "
Harry’s insides plummeted sickeni
ngly. They were trapped and 
outnumbered two to one. 
"“To me,” said Malfoy yet again. "
“Where’s Sirius?” Harry said. 
Several of the Death Eaters laughe
d. A harsh female voice from the 
midst of the shadowy figures to Ha
"rry’s left said triumphantly, “The "
Dark Lord always knows!” 
"“Always,” echoed Malfoy softly. “Now, give me the prophecy, "
Potter.” 
“I want to know where Sirius is!” 
“
I want to know where Sirius is
!” mimicked the woman to his left. 
She and her fellow Death Eaters had 
closed in so that they were 
B 
 782 mere feet away from Harry and the ot
"hers, the light from their wands "
dazzling Harry’s eyes. 
"“You’ve got him,” said Harry, ignoring"
" the rising panic in his chest, "
the dread he had been fighting since 
they had first entered the ninety-
seventh row. “He’s he
re. I know he is.” 
“
The little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was 
"twoo,"
"” said the woman in a horrible, "
mock-baby voice. Harry felt Ron 
stir beside him. 
"“Don’t do anything,” he muttered. “Not yet —” "
The woman who had mimicked him 
let out a raucous scream of 
laughter. 
“You hear him? 
You hear him
? Giving instructions to the other chil-
dren as though he thinks of fighting us!” 
"“Oh, you don’t know Potter as I do,"
" Bellatrix,” said Malfoy softly. "
“He has a great weakness for heroics;
 the Dark Lord understands this 
about him. 
"Now give me the prophecy, Potter."
” 
"“I know Sirius is here,” said Harry, though panic was causing his "
chest to constrict and he felt as th
ough he could not breathe properly. 
“
I know you’ve got him
!” 
"More of the Death Eaters laughed,"
 though the woman still laughed 
loudest of all. 
“It’s time you learned the differ
"ence between life and dreams, Pot-"
"ter,” said Malfoy. “Now give me "
"the prophecy, or we start using "
wands.” 
"“Go on, then,” said Harry, raising "
his own wand to chest height. As 
"he did so, the five wands of Ron,"
" Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna "
rose on either side of him. The 
knot in Harry’s stomach tightened. If 
"Sirius really was not here, he had le"
d his friends to their deaths for no 
reason at all. . . . 
But the Death Eaters
 did not strike. 
"“Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,” said Malfoy "
coolly. 
   783 It was Harry’s turn to laugh. 
"“Yeah, right!” he said. “I give you "
"this — prophecy, is it? And you’ll "
"just let us skip off home, will you?” "
The words were hardly out of 
his mouth when the female Death 
"Eater shrieked, “"
Accio Proph
 —” 
Harry was just ready for her. He shouted “
Protego
!” before she had 
"finished her spell, and though the gla"
ss sphere slipped to the tips of his 
fingers he managed to
 cling on to it. 
"“Oh, he knows how to play, little"
" bitty baby Potter,” she said, her "
"mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood. “Very well, then —” "
"“I TOLD YOU, NO!” Lucius Malfoy"
 roared at the woman. “If you 
smash it — !” 
Harry’s mind was racing. The Deat
h Eaters wanted this dusty 
spun-glass sphere. He had no interest
 in it. He just wanted to get 
"them all out of this alive, make sure"
 that none of his 
friends paid a ter-
rible price for his stupidity . . . 
"The woman stepped forward, away "
"from her fellows, and pulled off "
her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellat
"rix Lestrange’s face, making it "
"gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow. "
“You need more persuasion?” she 
"said, her chest rising and falling "
rapidly. “Very well — take the sm
"allest one,” she ordered the Death "
Eaters beside her. “Let him watch w
hile we torture the little girl. I’ll 
do it.” 
Harry felt the others close in around Ginny. He stepped sideways 
"so that he was right in front of her, the prophecy held up to his chest. "
“You’ll have to smash this if you wa
"nt to attack any of us,” he told "
Bellatrix. “I don’t think your boss wi
ll be too pleased if you come back 
"without it, will he?” "
"She did not move; she merely stared at him, the tip of her tongue "
moistening her thin mouth. 
"“So,” said Harry, “what kind of "
prophecy are we talking about 
anyway?” 
 784 He could not think what to do but to keep talking. Neville’s arm 
"was pressed against his, and he coul"
d feel him shaking.
 He could feel 
one of the other’s quickened breath on the back of his head. He was 
hoping they were all thinking hard 
"about ways to get out of this, be-"
cause his mind was blank. 
“What kind of prophecy?”
" repeated Bellatrix, the grin fading from "
"her face. “You jest, Harry Potter.” "
"“Nope, not jesting,” said Harry, his"
 eyes flicking from Death Eater 
"to Death Eater, looking for a weak"
" link, a space th"
rough which they 
could escape. “How come Voldemort wants it?” 
Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses. 
“You dare speak his name?” whispered Bellatrix. 
"“Yeah,” said Harry, maintaining his "
"tight grip on the glass ball, ex-"
pecting another attempt to bewitch it
" from him. “Yeah, I’ve got no "
problem saying Vol —” 
“Shut your mouth!” Bellatrix shrieked. “You dare speak his name 
"with your unworthy lips, you dare "
besmirch it with your half-blood’s 
"tongue, you dare —” "
“Did you know he’s a half-blo
od too?” said Harry recklessly. 
Hermione gave a little moan in hi
"s ear. “Voldemort? Yeah, his mother "
was a witch but his dad was a Muggle
 — or has he been telling you lot 
he’s pureblood?” 
“
STUPEF
 —” 
“
NO
!” 
A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange’s 
"wand, but Malfoy had deflected it. "
His spell caused hers to hit the 
shelf a foot to the left of Harry an
d several of the glass orbs there 
shattered. 
"Two figures, pearly white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled them-"
selves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began 
to speak. Their voices vied with ea
"ch other, so that only fragments  "
   785 of what they were saying could be
 heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix’s 
shouts. 
“. . . 
at the Solstice will come a new
" . . .” said the figure of an old, "
bearded man. 
“DO NOT ATTACK! WE NEED THE PROPHECY!” 
“He dared — he dares —” shrieked
 Bellatrix incoherently. “— He 
stands there — filt
hy half-blood —” 
“WAIT UNTIL WE’VE GOT THE PR
OPHECY!” bawled Malfoy. 
“. . . 
and none will come after
 . . .” said the figure of a young woman. 
The two figures that had burst 
from the shattered spheres had 
melted into thin air. Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile 
homes but fragments of glass upon 
"the floor. They had, however, "
given Harry an idea. The problem was 
going to be conveying it to the 
others. 
“You haven’t told me what’s so special about this prophecy I’m sup-
"posed to be handing over,” he said, playing for time. He moved his "
foot slowly sidewa
"ys, feeling around for someone else’s. "
“Do not play games with us
", Potter,” said Malfoy. "
"“I’m not playing games,” said Har"
"ry, half his mind on the conver-"
"sation, half on his wandering foot"
. And then he found someone’s toes 
and pressed down upon them. A shar
p intake of brea
th behind him 
told him they were Hermione’s. 
“What?” she whispered. 
“Dumbledore never told you that th
e reason you bear that scar was 
hidden in the bowels of the Depart
ment of Mysteries?” said Malfoy 
sneeringly. 
"“I — what?” said Harry, and for a moment he quite forgot his plan. "
“What about my scar?” 
“
What
?” whispered Hermione more urgently behind him. 
"“Can this be?” said Malfoy, soun"
ding maliciously delighted; some 
of the Death Eaters were laughing 
"again, and under cover of their  "
 786 "laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, movi"
ng his lips as little as possi-
"ble, “Smash shelves —” "
“Dumbledore never told you?” Malf
"oy repeated. “Well, this ex-"
"plains why you didn’t come earlier,"
" Potter, the Dark Lord wondered "
why —” 
“— when I say go —” 
“— you didn’t come running when
 he showed you the place where 
it was hidden in your dreams. He
 thought natural curiosity would 
make you want to hear th
e exact wording. . . .” 
“Did he?” said Harry. Behind him
 he felt rather than heard 
Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep 
"talking, to distract the Death Eate"
rs. “So he wanted 
me to come and 
"get it, did he? Why?” "
“
Why
?” Malfoy sounded incredulou
sly delighted. “Because the 
only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the De-
"partment of Mysteries, Potter, are "
"those about whom it was made, as "
the Dark Lord discovered when he at
tempted to use others to steal it 
for him.” 
“And why did he want to st
eal a prophecy about me?” 
"“About both of you, Potter, about "
both of you . . . Haven’t you ever 
wondered why the Dark Lord tr
ied to kill you as a baby?” 
Harry stared into the slitted eyehol
es through which 
Malfoy’s gray 
eyes were gleaming. Was this prop
hecy the reason Harry’s parents had 
"died, the reason he carried his lightning-bolt scar? Was the answer to "
all of this clutch
ed in his hand? 
“Someone made a prophecy about 
Voldemort and me?” he said 
"quietly, gazing at Lucius Malfoy, his"
 fingers tightening over the warm 
glass sphere in his hand. It was hard
ly larger than a Snitch and still 
gritty with dust. “And he’s made 
me come and get it for him? Why 
couldn’t he come and get it himself?” 
“Get it himself?” shrieked Bellatri
x on a cackle of
 mad laughter.  
   787 "“The Dark Lord, walk into the Mini"
"stry of Magic, when they are so "
sweetly ignoring his return? The Dark
" Lord, reveal himself to the Au-"
"rors, when at the moment they are "
wasting their time on my dear 
cousin?” 
“So he’s got you doing his dirty wo
"rk for him, has he?” said Harry. "
“Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it — and Bode?” 
"“Very good, Potter, very good . . .”"
 said Malfoy slowly. “But the 
Dark Lord knows you 
are not unintell —” 
“NOW!” yelled Harry. 
Five different voices 
behind him bellowed “
REDUCTO
!” Five 
curses flew in five different direct
ions and the shelves opposite them 
exploded as they hit. The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass 
"spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and "
"floated there, their voices echoin"
g from who knew what long-dead 
past amid the torrent of crashing 
glass and splintered wood now rain-
ing down upon the floor — 
"“RUN!” Harry yelled, and as the sh"
elves swayed precariously and 
more glass spheres began to pour fr
"om above, he seized a handful of "
"Hermione’s robes and dragged her forward, one arm over his head as "
chunks of shelf and shards of 
glass thundered down upon them. A 
Death Eater lunged forward throug
h the cloud of dust and Harry el-
bowed him hard in the ma
sked face. They were al
"l yelling, there were "
"cries of pain, thunderous crashes as"
 the shelves collapsed upon them-
"selves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their "
spheres — 
Harry found the way ahead clear 
"and saw Ron, Ginny, and Luna "
"sprint past him, their arms over th"
eir heads. Something heavy struck 
him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and 
sprinted onward; a hand caught hi
m by the shoulder; he heard Her-
mione shout “
Stupefy
!” and the hand released him at once. 
They were at the end of row nine
ty-seven; Harry turned right and  
 788 began to sprint in earnest. He co
uld hear footsteps 
right behind him 
and Hermione’s voice urging Neville on. The door through which 
they had come was ajar 
"straight ahead, Harry co"
uld see the glittering 
"light of the bell jar, he pelted through it, the prophecy still clutched "
"tight and safe in his hand, waited fo"
r the others to hurtle over the 
threshold before slamming 
the door behind them — 
“
Colloportus
!” gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an 
odd squelching noise. 
“Where — where are the ot
hers?” gasped Harry. 
"He had thought that Ron, Luna"
", and Ginny had been ahead of "
"them, that they would be"
" waiting in this room, but there was nobody "
there. 
“They must have gone the wrong 
"way!” whispered Hermione, ter-"
ror in her face. 
“Listen!” whispered Neville. 
Footsteps and shouts echoed from
 behind the door they had just 
sealed. Harry put his ear close to 
the door to listen and heard Lucius 
"Malfoy roar: “Leave Nott, "
"leave him, I say,"
 the Dark Lord will not care 
"for Nott’s injuries as much as losing that prophecy — Jugson, come "
"back here, we need to organize! We’ll split into pairs and search, and "
"don’t forget, be gentle with Potter until we’ve got the prophecy, you "
can kill the others if necessary — 
"Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the "
"left, Crabbe, Rabastan, go right — "
"Jugson, Dolohov, the door straight "
"ahead — Macnair and Avery, th"
"rough here — Rookwood, over "
"there — Mulciber, come with me!” "
“What do we do?” Hermione asked Ha
"rry, trembling from head to "
foot. 
"“Well, we don’t stand here waiting "
"for them to find us, for a start,” "
said Harry. “Let’s get aw
ay from this door. . . .” 
"They ran, quietly as they could, "
past the shimmering bell jar where 
the tiny egg was hatching and unhatc
"hing, toward the exit into the  "
   789 circular hallway at the far end of 
the room. They were almost there 
when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door 
Hermione had charmed shut. 
“Stand aside!” said a rough voice. “
Alohomora
!” 
"As the door flew open, Harry, Hermione, and Neville dived under "
desks. They could see the bottom 
of the two Death Eaters’ robes 
"drawing nearer, their fe"
et moving rapidly. 
“They might’ve run straight throug
"h to the hall,” said the rough "
voice. 
"“Check under the desks,” said another. "
Harry saw the knees of the Death Ea
ters bend. Poking his wand out 
"from under the desk he shouted, “"
STUPEFY
!” 
A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backward into 
a grandfather clock and knocked it
" over. The second Death Eater, "
"however, had leapt aside to avoi"
d Harry’s spell and now pointed his 
"own wand at Hermione, who had craw"
led out from under the desk to 
get a better aim. 
“
Avada 
—” 
Harry launched himself across th
e floor and grabbed the Death 
"Eater around the knees, causing him to"
 topple and his 
aim to go awry. 
Neville overturned his desk in his 
anxiety to help; pointing his wand 
"wildly at the struggling pair he cried, “"
EXPELLIARMUS
!” 
Both Harry’s and the Death Eater’
s wands flew out of their hands 
and soared back toward the entrance
 to the Hall of Prophecy; both 
"scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in "
"front and Harry hot on his heels, Nevi"
"lle bringing up the rear, plainly "
horrorstruck at wh
at he had done. 
"“Get out of the way, "
"Harry!” yelled Neville, "
clearly determined to 
repair the damage. 
Harry flung himself sideways as
 Neville took aim again and 
"shouted, “"
STUPEFY
!” 
 790 The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eater’s shoulder and 
hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the 
wall full of variously shaped hour-
glasses. The cabinet fell to the floor 
"and burst apart, glass flying every-"
"where, then sprang back up onto"
" the wall, fully mended, then fell "
"down again, and shattered — "
The Death Eater had snatched up 
"his wand, which lay on the floor "
beside the glittering bell jar. Ha
rry ducked down behind another desk 
as the man turned — his mask had sli
"pped so that he could not see, he "
ripped it off with his 
"free hand and shouted, “"
STUP 
—” 
“
STUPEFY
"!” screamed Hermione, who "
had just caught up with 
them. The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his 
"chest; he froze, his arm still raised"
", his wand fell to the floor with a "
clatter and he collapsed backward to
ward the bell jar. Harry expected 
to hear a 
"clunk,"
 for the man to hit solid gla
ss and slide off the jar onto 
"the floor, but instead, his head sank "
through the surface of the bell jar 
"as though it was nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest, "
sprawled on his back on
" the table, with his he"
ad lying inside the jar 
full of glittering wind. 
“
Accio Wand
!” cried Hermione. Harry’s wa
nd flew from a dark cor-
ner into her hand and 
she threw it to him. 
"“Thanks,” he said, “right, let’s get out of —” "
"“Look out!” said Neville, horrifie"
"d, staring at the Death Eater’s "
head in the bell jar. 
"All three of them raised their wands again, but none of them "
"struck. They were all gazing, open"
"mouthed, appalled, at what was "
happening to the man’s head. 
"It was shrinking very fast, growing "
"balder and balder, the black hair "
and stubble retracting into his sk
"ull, his cheeks smooth, his skull "
round and covered with 
a peachlike fuzz. . . . 
"A baby’s head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled "
neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again. But even as 
"they watched, their mouths open, th"
e head began to swell to its previ-
   791 "ous proportions again, thick black "
hair was sprouting from the pate 
and chin. . . . 
"“It’s time,” said Hermione in an awestruck voice. “"
Time
 . . .” 
The Death Eater shook his ugly head
" again, trying to clear it, but "
before he could pull hims
"elf together again, it be"
gan to shrink back to 
babyhood once more. . . . 
There was a shout from a room ne
"arby, then a crash and a scream. "
"“RON?” Harry yelled, turning quic"
kly from the monstrous trans-
formation taking place befo
re them. “GINNY? LUNA?” 
“Harry!” Hermione screamed. 
The Death Eater had pulled his head
 out of the bell jar. His ap-
"pearance was utterly bizarre, his tiny"
 baby’s head bawl
ing loudly while 
his thick arms flailed dangerously 
"in all directions, narrowly missing "
"Harry, who ducked. Harry raised his"
 wand but to his amazement 
Hermione seized his arm. 
“You can’t hurt a baby!” 
There was no time to argue the po
int. Harry could hear more foot-
steps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy they had just left and 
"knew, too late, that he ought not to"
 have shouted and given away their 
position. 
"“Come on!” he said again, and le"
aving the ugly baby-headed Death 
"Eater staggering behind them, they"
 took off for the door that stood 
"ajar at the other end of the room, le"
ading back into the black hallway. 
They had run halfway toward it
 when Harry saw through the open 
door two more Death Eaters running
 across the black room toward 
them. Veering left he burst instead in
"to a small, dark, cluttered office "
and slammed the 
door behind them. 
“
Collo
" —” began Hermione, but before she could complete the spell "
the door had burst open again and 
the two Death Eaters had come 
"hurtling inside. With a cry of triumph, both yelled, “"
IMPEDIMENTA
!” 
"Harry, Hermione, and Neville were "
all knocked backward off their 
"feet. Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view, "
 792 Hermione smashed into a bookcase
 and was promptly deluged in a 
cascade of heavy books; the back 
of Harry’s head slammed into the 
"stone wall behind him, tiny lights bu"
"rst in front of his eyes, and for a "
moment he was too dizzy an
d bewildered to react. 
“WE’VE GOT HIM!” yelled the 
"Death Eater nearest Harry, “IN "
AN OFFICE OFF —” 
“
Silencio
"!” cried Hermione, and the ma"
n’s voice was extinguished. 
He continued to mouth through the 
"hole in his mask, but no sound "
came out; he was thrust
 aside by his fellow. 
“
Petrificus Totalus
"!” shouted Harry, as the second Death Eater raised "
"his wand. His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forward, "
"facedown onto the rug at Harry’s feet, "
stiff as a board and unable to 
move at all. 
"“Well done, Ha —” "
But the Death Eater Hermione had 
just struck dumb made a sud-
den slashing movement with his wa
nd from which flew a streak of 
what looked like purple flame. It
 passed right across Hermione’s chest; 
she gave a tiny “oh!” as though of 
surprise and then crumpled onto the 
floor where she lay motionless. 
“HERMIONE!” 
Harry fell to his knees beside her as
 Neville crawled rapidly toward 
"her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of him. The Death "
Eater kicked out hard at Neville’s head as he emerged — his foot 
broke Neville’s wand in two and 
connected with his face — Neville 
gave a howl of pain and recoiled
", clutching his mouth and nose. Harry "
"twisted around, his own wand held high, and saw that the Death "
Eater had ripped off his mask and wa
s pointing his wand directly at 
"Harry, who recognized the long, pale, twisted face from the "
Daily 
Prophet
": Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the "
Prewetts. 
Dolohov grinned. With his free
" hand, he pointed from the "
prophecy still clutched in Harry’s ha
"nd, to himself, then at Hermione. "
   793 Though he could no longer speak 
his meaning could not have been 
clearer: 
"Give me the prophecy, or you get the same as her."
 . . . 
“Like you won’t kill us all the mom
ent I hand it over anyway!” said 
Harry. 
A whine of panic inside his he
ad was preventing him thinking 
properly. He had one hand on He
"rmione’s shoulder, which was still "
"warm, yet did not dare look at her properly. "
"Don’t let her be dead, don’t "
"let her be dead, it’s my fault if she’s dead."
 . . . 
"“Whaddever you do, Harry,” said Ne"
ville fiercely from under the 
"desk, lowering his hands to show"
 a clearly broken nose and blood 
pouring down his mouth and ch
"in, “don’d gib it to him!” "
Then there was a crash outside th
"e door, and Dolohov looked over "
his shoulder — the baby-headed De
ath Eater had appeared in the 
"doorway, his head bawling, his great fi"
sts still flailing 
uncontrollably at 
everything around him. 
Harry seized his chance: “
PETRIFICUS TOTALUS
!” 
The spell hit Dolohov before he co
"uld block it, and he toppled for-"
"ward across his comrade, both of them rigid as boards and unable to "
move an inch. 
"“Hermione,” Harry said at once, "
shaking her as the baby-headed 
"Death Eater blundered out of sight again. “Hermione, wake up. . . .” "
"“Whaddid he do to her?” said Neville, crawling out from under the "
desk again to kneel at her other si
"de, blood streaming from his rapidly "
swelling nose. “I dunno. . . .” 
Neville groped for Hermione’s wrist. 
"“Dat’s a pulse, Harry, I’b sure id is. . . .” "
Such a powerful wave of relief sw
ept through Harry 
that for a mo-
ment he felt light-headed. 
“She’s alive?” 
"“Yeah, I dink so. . . .” "
There was a pause in which Harry li
stened hard for the sounds of  
 794 "more footsteps, but all he could he"
ar were the whimpers and blunder-
ings of the baby Death 
Eater in the next room. 
"“Neville, we’re not far from the "
"exit,” Harry whispered. “We’re "
right next to that circul
ar room. . . . If we ca
n just get you across it 
and find the right door before any 
"more Death Eaters come, I’ll bet "
you can get Hermione up the corridor 
and into the lift. . . . Then you 
could find someone. . . 
. Raise the alarm . . .” 
“And whad are you going do do?” sa
"id Neville, mopping his bleed-"
ing nose with his sleeve 
and frowning 
at Harry. 
"“I’ve got to find the others,” said Harry. "
"“Well, I’b goin"
"g do find dem wid you,” "
said Neville firmly. 
“But Hermione —” 
"“We’ll dake her wid us,” said Neville firmly. “I’ll carry her — you’re "
bedder at fighding 
dem dan I ab —” 
He stood up and seized one of He
"rmione’s arms, glared at Harry, "
"who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione’s "
limp form over Ne
ville’s shoulders. 
"“Wait,” said Harry, snat"
ching up Hermione’s 
wand from the floor 
"and shoving it into Nevilles hand, “you’d better take this. . . .” "
Neville kicked aside the broken fra
gments of his own wand as they 
walked slowly to
ward the door. 
"“My gran’s going do kill be,” said "
"Neville thickly, "
blood spattering 
"from his nose as he spoke, “dat"
 was by dad’s old wand. . . .” 
Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously. 
The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into 
"things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling "
"and confused, while the glass cabi"
net that Harry now suspected had 
contained Time-Turners continued to fa
"ll, shatter, and repair itself on "
the wall behind them. 
"“He’s never going to notice us,” he whispered. “C’mon . . . keep "
close behind me. . . .” 
   795 They crept out of the office and back toward the door into the 
"black hallway, which now seemed comp"
letely deserted. They walked a 
"few steps forward, Neville totter"
ing slightly due to Hermione’s 
weight. The door of the Time R
"oom swung shut behind them, and "
the walls began to rotate once more
. The recent blow on the back of 
Harry’s head seemed to have unstea
"died him; he narrowed his eyes, "
"swaying slightly, until the walls sto"
pped moving again. With a sinking 
heart Harry saw that Hermione’s fiery crosses had faded from the 
doors. 
“So which way d’you reck — ?” 
But before they could make a deci
"sion as to which way to try, a "
door to their right sprang open an
d three people fe
ll out of it. 
"“Ron!” croaked Harry, dashing "
toward them. “Ginny — are you 
all — ?” 
"“Harry,” said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forward, seizing the "
front of Harry’s robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes. “There 
"you are. . . . Ha ha ha . . . You look funny, Harry. . . . You’re all messed "
up. . . . 
Ron’s face was very white and some
thing dark was trickling from 
the corner of his mouth. Next mo
"ment his knees had given way, but "
he still clutched the front of Harry’
"s robes, so that Harry was pulled "
into a kind of bow. 
“Ginny?” Harry said fear
fully. “What happened?” 
But Ginny shook her head and slid 
down the wall into a sitting po-
"sition, panting and holding her ankle. "
"“I think her ankle’s broken, I heard something crack,” whispered "
"Luna, who was bending over her and "
who alone seemed to be unhurt. 
“Four of them chased us into a dark 
"room full of planets, it was a very "
"odd place, some of the ti"
me we were ju
st floating in
 the dark —” 
"“Harry, we saw Uranus up close!” said Ron, still giggling feebly. "
"“Get it, Harry? We saw Ur"
anus — ha ha ha —” 
 796 A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron’s mouth and burst. 
"“Anyway, one of them grabbed Gi"
"nny’s foot, I used the Reductor "
Curse and blew up Pluto 
"in his face, but . . .” "
Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginn
"y, who was breathing in a very "
"shallow way, her eyes still closed. "
“And what about Ron?” said Harr
"y fearfully, as Ron continued to "
"giggle, still hanging off th"
e front of Harry’s robes. 
"“I don’t know what they hit him with,” said Luna sadly, “but he’s "
"gone a bit funny, I could hardly"
 get him along at all. . . .” 
"“Harry,” said Ron, pulling Harry’"
s ear down to his mouth and still 
"giggling weakly, “you know who this"
" girl is, Harry? She’s Loony . . . "
Loony Lovegood . . . 
ha ha ha . . .” 
"“We’ve got to get out of here,” said Harry firmly. “Luna, can you "
help Ginny?” 
"“Yes,” said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping, "
putting an arm around Ginny’s waist and pulling her up. 
"“It’s only my ankle, I can do it myself!” said Ginny impatiently, but "
next moment she had collapsed side
ways and grabbed Luna for sup-
"port. Harry pulled Ron’s arm over his shoulder just as, so many "
"months ago, he had pulled Dudley’s"
. He looked around: They had a 
one-in-twelve chance of getting 
the exit right the first time — 
He heaved Ron toward a door; they
 were within a few feet of it 
when another door across the hall bu
rst open and three Death Eaters 
"sped into the hall, led "
by Bellatrix Lestrange. 
“
There they are
!” she shrieked. 
Stunning Spells shot across 
the room: Harry smashed his way 
"through the door ahead, flung Ron "
"unceremoniously from him, and "
ducked back to help Neville in with
 Hermione. They were all over the 
threshold just in ti
me to slam the door 
against Bellatrix. 
“
Colloportus
"!” shouted Harry, and he hear"
d three bodies slam into 
the door on the other side. 
   797 “It doesn’t matter!” said a man’s vo
ice. “There are other ways in — 
"WE’VE GOT THEM, THEY’RE HERE!” "
Harry spun around. They were back
" in the Brain Room and, sure "
"enough, there were doors all around "
the walls. He coul
d hear footsteps 
in the hall behind them as more 
Death Eaters came running to join 
the first. 
“Luna — Neville — help me!” 
The three of them tore around th
"e room, sealing the doors as they "
went: Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his 
haste to reach 
the next door. 
“
Colloportus
!” 
There were footsteps running al
ong behind the doors; every now 
and then another heavy body would la
"unch itself against one, so it "
creaked and shuddered. Luna and 
Neville were bewitching the doors 
"along the opposite wall — then, as "
Harry reached the very top of the 
"room, he heard "
"Luna cry, “"
Collo 
— 
aaaaaaaaargh
 . . .” 
He turned in time to see her flying through the air. Five Death 
Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not 
"reached in time; Luna hit a desk, sl"
id over its surface and onto the 
floor on the other side 
"where she lay sprawled, "
as still as Hermione. 
"“Get Potter!” shrieked Bellatrix, "
and she ran at him. He dodged her 
and sprinted back up the room; he 
was safe as long as they thought 
they might hit 
the prophecy — 
"“Hey!” said Ron, who had stagge"
red to his feet and was now totter-
"ing drunkenly toward Harry, giggling. “Hey, Harry, there are "
brains
 in 
"here, ha ha ha, isn’t "
"that weird, Harry?” "
"“Ron, get out of the way, get down —” "
But Ron had already pointe
d his wand at the tank. 
"“Honest, Harry, they’re brains — look — "
Accio Brain
!” 
"The scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry, Ginny, and Neville "
and each of the Death Eaters turned 
in spite of themselves to watch  
 798 the top of the tank as a brain burst 
from the green liqu
id like a leap-
ing fish. For a moment it seemed su
"spended in midair, then it soared "
"toward Ron, spinning as"
" it came, and what l"
ooked like ribbons of 
"moving images flew from it, un"
raveling like ro
lls of film — 
"“Ha ha ha, Harry, look at"
" it —” said Ron, watching it disgorge its "
"gaudy innards. “Harry, come an"
"d touch it, bet it’s weird —” "
"“RON, NO!” "
Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tenta-
"cles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would "
not be anything good. He darted fo
rward but Ron had already caught 
the brain in his ou
tstretched hands. 
The moment they made contact wi
"th his skin, the "
tentacles began 
wrapping themselves around Ron’s arms like ropes. 
"“Harry, look what’s happen — no"
" — no, I don’t like it — no, "
stop — 
stop
 —” 
But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron’s chest now. He 
tugged and tore at them as the brai
n was pulled tight against him like 
an octopus’s body. 
“
Diffindo
"!” yelled Harry, trying to se"
ver the feelers wrapping them-
"selves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break. "
"Ron fell over, still thra"
shing against his bonds. 
"“Harry, it’ll suffocate him!” screamed Ginny, immobilized by her "
broken ankle on the floor — then a je
t of red light flew from one of 
the Death Eater’s wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled 
over sideways and la
y there unconscious. 
“
STUBEFY
!”
"shouted Neville, wheeling around and waving "
Hermione’s wand at the 
oncoming Death Eaters. “
"STUBEFY, "
STUBEFY
!” 
But nothing happened — one of th
e Death Eaters shot their own 
Stunning Spell at Neville; it misse
d him by inches. Harry and Neville 
"were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of "
whom sent streams of silver light like
 arrows past them that left craters 
   799 in the wall behind them. Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange 
sprinted right at him. Holding th
e prophecy high above his head he 
sprinted back up the room; all he 
could think of doing was to draw 
the Death Eaters away
 from the others. 
It seemed to have worked. They st
"reaked after him, knocking chairs "
and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the 
"prophecy, and he dashed through th"
"e only door still open, the one "
through which the Death Eaters themselves had come. Inwardly pray-
ing that Neville would stay with Ron — find some way of releasing 
him — he ran a few feet
 into the new room 
and felt the floor 
vanish — 
He was falling down steep stone st
"ep after steep stone step, bounc-"
"ing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath "
"out of his body, he landed flat on "
his back in the sunken pit where the 
stone archway stood on its dais. The 
whole room was ringing with the 
Death Eaters’ laughter. He looked 
up and saw the five who had been 
in the Brain Room descending to
"ward him, while as many more "
emerged through other doorways an
d began leaping from bench to 
bench toward him. Harry got to his 
feet though his legs were trem-
bling so badly they barely support
ed him. The prophecy was still 
"miraculously unbroken in his left hand, his wand clutched tightly in "
"his right. He backed away, lookin"
"g around, trying to keep all the "
Death Eaters within his sights. Th
e back of his legs hit something 
solid; he had reached the dais wh
ere the archway stood. He climbed 
backward onto it. 
"The Death Eaters all halted, gazing"
 at him. Some were panting as 
hard as he was. One was bleeding ba
"dly; Dolohov, freed of the full "
"Body-Bind, was leering, his wand "
pointing straight at Harry’s face. 
"“Potter, your race is run,” drawled Lucius Malfoy, pulling off his "
mask. “Now hand me the prophe
cy like a good boy. . . .” 
"“Let — let the others go, and I’"
ll give it to you!” said Harry 
desperately. 
 800 A few of the Death Eaters laughed. 
“You are not in a position to barg
"ain, Potter,” said Lucius Malfoy, "
"his pale face flushed with pleasure. “You see, there are ten of us and "
only one of you . . . or hasn’t 
Dumbledore ever taught you how to 
count?” 
“He’s dot alone!” shouted a voice 
from above them. “He’s still god 
be!” 
Harry’s heart sank. Neville was sc
rambling down the stone benches 
"toward them, Hermione’s wand he"
ld fast in his trembling hand. 
“Neville — no — go back to Ron —” 
“
STUBEFY
"!” Neville shouted again, pointing his wand at each "
"Death Eater in turn, “"
STUBEFY
! 
STUBE
 —” 
One of the largest Death Eaters 
"seized Neville from behind, pin-"
ioning his arms to his sides. He 
struggled and kicked; several of the 
Death Eaters laughed. 
"“It’s Longbottom, isn’t it?” sneer"
"ed Lucius Malfoy. “Well, your "
grandmother is used to 
losing family members to
 our cause. . . . Your 
death will not come as a great shock. . . .” 
"“Longbottom?” repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her "
"gaunt face. “Why, I have had the pl"
"easure of meeting your parents, "
boy. . . .” 
"“I DOE YOU HAB!” roared Neville, "
and he fought so hard against 
his captor’s encircling grip that 
"the Death Eater shouted, “Someone "
Stun him!” 
"“No, no, no,” said Bellatrix. She "
"looked transported, alive with ex-"
"citement as she glanced at Harry, then"
" back at Neville. “No, let’s see "
how long Longbottom lasts before he 
cracks like his parents. . . . Un-
less Potter wants to give us the prophecy —” 
"“DON’D GIB ID DO DEM!” roared Neville, who seemed beside "
"himself, kicking and writhing as Be"
llatrix drew nearer to him and his 
"captor, her wand raised. “DON"
"’D GIB ID DO DEM, HARRY!” "
Bellatrix raised her wand. “
Crucio
!” 
   801 "Neville screamed, his legs drawn up"
 to his chest so that the Death 
Eater holding him was momentarily 
holding him off the ground. The 
Death Eater dropped him and he 
"fell to the floor, twitching and "
screaming in agony. 
“That was just a taster!” said Bell
"atrix, raising her wand so that "
Neville’s screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet. She turned 
"and gazed up at Harry. “Now, Potter, "
"either give us the prophecy, or "
watch your little friend
 die the hard way!” 
Harry did not have to think; ther
e was no choice. The prophecy 
was hot with the heat from his clutch
ing hand as he he
ld it out. Mal-
foy jumped forward to take it. 
"Then, high above them, two more "
doors burst open and five more 
"people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks, and "
Kingsley. 
Malfoy turned and raised his wa
"nd, but Tonks had already sent a "
Stunning Spell right at him. Harry di
d not wait to see whether it had 
"made contact, but dived off the dais"
 out of the way. The Death Eaters 
were completely distracted by the 
appearance of the members of the 
"Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped "
from step to step toward the su
nken floor: Through the darting bod-
"ies, the flashes of light, Harry co"
uld see Neville crawling along. He 
dodged another jet of red 
light and flung himself fl
at on the ground to 
reach Neville. 
"“Are you okay?” he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their "
heads. 
"“Yes,” said Neville, trying to pull himself up. "
“And Ron?” 
“I dink he’s all right — he wa
s still fighding the brain when I 
left —” 
The stone floor between them expl
"oded as a spell hit it, leaving a "
crater right where Neville’s hand
 had been seconds before. Both 
"scrambled away from the spot, then "
"a thick arm came out of nowhere, "
 802 seized Harry around the neck and pull
"ed him upright, so that his toes "
were barely touching the floor. 
"“Give it to me,” growled a voice in his ear, “give me the "
prophecy —” 
The man was pressing so tightly on
 Harry’s windpipe that he could 
not breathe — through watering eyes
 he saw Sirius dueling with a 
Death Eater some ten feet
 away. Kingsley was fighting two at once; 
"Tonks, still halfway up the tiered se"
"ats, was firing spells down at Bel-"
latrix — nobody seemed to realiz
e that Harry was dying. . . . He 
turned his wand backward toward 
"the man’s side, but had no breath "
"to utter an incantation, and the ma"
n’s free hand was groping toward 
the hand in which Harry wa
s grasping the prophecy — 
“AARGH!” 
Neville had come lunging out of no
where: Unable to articulate a 
"spell, he had jabbed Hermione’s wa"
nd hard into the eyehole of the 
Death Eater’s mask. The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of 
"pain and Harry whirled around to face him and gasped, “"
STUPEFY
!” 
The Death Eater keeled over backwa
rd and his mask slipped off. It 
"was Macnair, Buckbeak’s would-be ki"
"ller, one of his eyes now swollen "
and bloodshot. 
"“Thanks!” Harry said to Neville, pu"
lling him aside as Sirius and his 
"Death Eater lurched past, dueling so"
 fiercely that their wands were 
blurs. Then Harry’s foot made co
ntact with something round and 
hard and he slipped — for a moment he thought he had dropped the 
"prophecy, then saw Moody’s magic eye spinning away across the floor. "
"Its owner was lying on his side, bl"
eeding from the 
"head, and his at-"
tacker was now bearing down upon 
"Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his "
long pale face tw
isted with glee. 
“
Tarantallegra
"!” he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose "
legs went immediately into a kind 
"of frenzied tap dance, unbalancing "
him and causing him to fall to th
e floor again. “N
"ow, Potter —” "
   803 He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had 
used on Hermione just
" as Harry yelled, “"
Protego
!” 
Harry felt something streak
 across his face like 
a blunt knife but the 
"force of it knocked him sideways, "
and he fell over Neville’s jerking 
"legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell. "
Dolohov raised his wand again. “
Accio Proph
 —” 
"Sirius hurtled out of nowhere, "
"rammed Dolohov with his shoulder, "
and sent him flying out of the way.
 The prophecy had again flown to 
the tips of Harry’s fingers but he ha
d managed to cling to it. Now Sir-
"ius and Dolohov were dueling, th"
"eir wands flashing like swords, "
sparks flying from their wand tips — 
Dolohov drew back his wand to 
make the same slashing movement 
"he had used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled, "
“
Petrificus Totalus
"!” Once again, Dolohov’s "
arms and legs snapped to-
gether and he keeled over backward
", landing with a crash on his back. "
"“Nice one!” shouted Sirius, forcing Harry’s head down as a pair of "
Stunning Spells flew toward them. 
“Now I want you to get out of —” 
They both ducked again. A jet 
of green light had narrowly missed 
Sirius; across the room Harry saw To
nks fall from halfway up the 
"stone steps, her limp form toppling "
"from stone seat to stone seat, and "
"Bellatrix, triumphant, running back toward the fray. "
"“Harry, take the prophecy, grab "
"Neville, and run!” Sirius yelled, "
dashing to meet Bellatrix. Harry
 did not see what happened next: 
Kingsley swayed across his field of
" vision, battling with the pock-"
"marked Rookwood, now ma"
sk-less; another jet of green light flew 
over Harry’s head as he laun
ched himself toward Neville — 
“Can you stand?” he bellowed in Nevi
"lle’s ear, as Neville’s legs jerked "
and twitched uncontrollably. “Put
 your arm round my neck —” 
Neville did so — Harry heaved — Neville’s legs were still flying in 
"every direction, they would not support him and then, out of "
"nowhere, a man lunged at them. Bo"
"th fell backward, Neville’s legs  "
 804 "waving wildly like an overturned beetle’s, Harry with his left arm held "
up in the air to try and save the small glass ball from being smashed. 
"“The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!” snarled Lucius Mal-"
"foy’s voice in his ear, and Harry felt "
the tip of Malfoy’s wand pressing 
hard between his ribs. 
“No — get — off — me . . 
. Neville — catch it!” 
Harry flung the prophecy across 
"the floor, Neville spun himself "
around on his back and scooped the 
ball to his chest. Malfoy pointed 
"the wand instead at Neville, but Ha"
rry jabbed his own wand back over 
his shoulder 
"and yelled, “"
Impedimenta
!” 
Malfoy was blasted off his back. 
As Harry scramble
d up again he 
looked around and saw Malfoy smas
h into the dais on which Sirius 
and Bellatrix were now dueling. Ma
lfoy aimed his wand at Harry and 
"Neville again, but before he could "
"draw breath to strike, Lupin had "
jumped between them. 
"“Harry, round up th"
e others and GO!” 
Harry seized Neville by the should
er of his robes and lifted him 
bodily onto the first tier of stone steps. Neville’s legs twitched and 
jerked and would not support his we
ight. Harry heaved again with all 
the strength he possessed and 
they climbed another step — 
A spell hit the stone bench at Ha
rry’s heel. It crumbled away and 
he fell back to the step
 below: Neville sank to 
"the ground, his legs still "
"jerking and thrashing, and thrust"
 the prophecy into his pocket. 
"“Come on!” said Harry desperately, "
hauling at Neville’s robes. “Just 
try and push with your legs —” 
He gave another stupendous heave and Neville’s robes tore all along 
the left seam — the small spun-gla
ss ball dropped from his pocket 
and before either of them could ca
"tch it, one of Neville’s floundering "
feet kicked it. It flew some ten feet
 to their right an
d smashed on the 
step beneath them. As both of them
 stared at the place where it had 
"broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with  "
   805 hugely magnified eyes rose into th
"e air, unnoticed by any but them. "
Harry could see its mout
"h moving, but in all the crashes and screams "
"and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he "
hear. The figure stopped speaking 
and dissolved into
 nothingness. 
"“Harry, I’b sorry!” cried Neville, hi"
s face anguished as his legs con-
"tinued to flounder, “I’b so sorry"
", Harry, I didn’d bean do —” "
“It doesn’t matter!” Harry shouted. 
"“Just try and stand, let’s get out "
of —” 
“
Dubbledore
"!” said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported, "
staring over Ha
rry’s shoulder. 
“What?” 
“DUBBLEDORE!” 
Harry turned to look where Nevill
e was staring. Directly above 
"them, framed in the doorway fr"
"om the Brain Room, stood Albus "
"Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his fa"
ce white and furious. Harry felt a 
kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body — 
they 
were saved.
Dumbledore sped down the steps pa
"st Neville and Harry, who had "
no more thought of leaving. Dumb
ledore was already at the foot of 
the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized he was there. There 
were yells; one of the Death Eaters 
"ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey "
up the stone steps opposite. Dumble
dore’s spell pulled him back as 
easily and effortlessly as though he
 had hooked him with an invisible 
line — 
"Only one couple were still battling, apparently unaware of the new "
arrival. Harry saw Sirius duck Bellat
rix’s jet of red light: He was laugh-
"ing at her. “Come on, you can do better than that!” he yelled, his voice "
echoing around the cavernous room. 
The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest. 
"The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened "
in shock. 
 806 "Harry released Neville, "
though he was unaware of doing so. He was 
"jumping down the steps again, pulling out his wand, as Dumbledore "
turned to the dais too. 
It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall. His body curved in a grace-
ful arc as he sank backward throug
h the ragged veil hanging from the 
arch. . . . 
And Harry saw the look
 of mingled fear and 
surprise on his god-
"father’s wasted, once-handsome face"
 as he fell through the ancient 
"doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a mo-"
ment as though in a high wind and then fell back into place. 
Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange’s tr
"iumphant scream, but knew it "
"meant nothing — Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, he "
would reappear from the ot
her side any second. . . . 
But Sirius did not reappear. 
"“SIRIUS!” Harry yelled, “SIRIUS!” "
"He had reached the floor, his breath"
 coming in searing gasps. Sirius 
"must be just behind the curtain, "
"he, Harry, would pull him back out "
again. . . . 
"But as he reached the ground and sprinted toward the dais, Lupin "
grabbed Harry around the ch
"est, holding him back. "
“There’s nothing yo
"u can do, Harry —” "
"“Get him, save him, he’s only just gone through!” "
"“It’s too late, Harry —” "
“We can still reach him —” 
"Harry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go. . . . "
"“There’s nothing you can do, Harry . . . nothing. . . . He’s gone.” "
He hasn’t gone!”
 Harry yelled. 
"He did not believe it, he would not believe it; still he "
fought Lupin with every bit of strength he had: Lupin did not under-
"stand, people hid behind that curt"
"ain, he had heard them whispering "
the first time he had entered the 
"room — Sirius was hiding, simply "
lurking out of sight — 
"“SIRIUS!” he bellowed, “SIRIUS!” "
"“He can’t come back, Harry,” said Lu"
"pin, his voice breaking as he "
struggled to contain Harry. “He can’
"t come back, because he’s d —” "
“HE — IS — NOT — DEAD!” 
roared Harry. “SIRIUS!” 
There was movement going on ar
"ound them, pointless bustling, "
"the flashes of more spells. To Harry it was meaningless noise, the de-"
flected curses flying past them di
"d not matter, nothing mattered ex-"
cept that Lupin stop pretending th
"at Sirius, who was standing feet "
from them behind that 
"old curtain, was not go"
ing to emerge at any 
"moment, shaking back his dark hair"
 and eager to re
enter the battle — 
Lupin dragged Harry away from the 
"dais, Harry still staring at the "
"archway, angry at Sirius no"
w for keeping him waiting — 
H 
 808 "But some part of him realized, even"
 as he fought to break free from 
"Lupin, that Sirius had never kept "
him waiting before. . . . Sirius had 
"risked everything, always, to see Harry,"
 to help him. . . . If Sirius was 
not reappearing out of that arch
way when Harry was 
yelling for him 
as though his life depended on it
", the only possible explanation was "
that he could not come back. . 
. . That he really was . . . 
Dumbledore had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in 
"the middle of the room, seemingly "
immobilized by invisible ropes. 
Mad-Eye Moody had crawled across the room to where Tonks lay and 
was attempting to revive her. Behind 
the dais there were still flashes of 
"light, grunts, and cries — Kingsley had run forward to continue Sir-"
ius’s duel wi
th Bellatrix. 
“Harry?” 
Neville had slid down the stone b
enches one by one to the place 
where Harry stood. Harry was no lo
"nger struggling against Lupin, "
who maintained a precautionary 
grip on his arm nevertheless. 
“Harry . . . I’b really sorry. . . .”
 said Neville. His 
legs were still 
dancing uncontrollably. “Was da
t man — was Sirius Black a — a 
friend of yours?” 
Harry nodded. 
"“Here,” said Lupin quietly, and poin"
ting his wand at Neville’s legs 
"he said, “"
Finite.
” The spell was lifted. Neville’s legs fell back onto the 
floor and remained still. Lupin’s face was pale. “Let’s — let’s find the 
"others. Where are they all, Neville?” "
Lupin turned away from the archwa
y as he spoke. It sounded as 
though every word wa
s causing him pain. 
"“Dey’re all back dere,” said Nevi"
lle. “A brain addacked Ron bud I 
"dink he’s all righd — and Herbione’s unconscious, bud we could feel "
a bulse —” 
There was a loud bang and a yell
 from behind the dais. Harry saw 
"Kingsley, yelling in pain, hit the gr"
ound. Bellatrix Lestrange turned  
   809 tail and ran as Dumbledore whipped around. He aimed a spell at her 
but she deflected it. She was 
halfway up the steps now — 
"“Harry — no!” cried Lupin, but "
Harry had already 
ripped his arm 
from Lupin’s slackened grip. 
“SHE KILLED SIRIUS!” bellowed Harry. “SHE KILLED HIM 
— I’LL KILL HER!” 
"And he was off, scrambling up the stone benches. People were "
shouting behind him but he did not 
care. The hem of Bellatrix’s robes 
whipped out of sight ahead and they 
were back in the room where the 
brains were swimming. . . . 
She aimed a curse over her shoulder
. The tank rose into the air and 
tipped. Harry was deluged in the foul-smelling potion within. The 
brains slipped and slid over him 
"and began spinning their long, col-"
"ored tentacles, but he shouted, “"
Wingardium Leviosa
!” and they flew 
into the air away from him. Slipping
 and sliding he ran on toward the 
"door. He leapt over Luna, who was gr"
"oaning on the floor, past Ginny, "
"who said, “Harry — what — ?” pa"
"st Ron, who giggled feebly, and "
"Hermione, who was still unconscious. He wrenched open the door "
into the circular black hall and 
saw Bellatrix disappearing through a 
door on the other side of the ro
om — beyond her was the corridor 
leading back to the lifts. 
"He ran, but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls "
had begun to rotate again. Once more he was surrounded by streaks 
of blue light from the whirling candelabra. 
“Where’s the exit?” he shouted desp
"erately, as the wall rumbled to a "
halt again. “Where’s the way out?” 
The room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask. The door 
"right behind him flew open, and the "
corridor toward th
e lifts stretched 
"ahead of him, torch-lit an"
d empty. He ran. . . . 
He could hear a lift clattering ah
ead of him. He sprinted up the 
"passageway, swung around the corner, and slammed his fist onto the  "
 810 button to call a second lift. It ja
ngled and banged lower and lower; the 
grilles slid open and Harry dashed 
"inside, now hammering the button "
marked Atrium. The doors slid 
shut and he wa
s rising. . . . 
He forced his way out of the lift 
before the grilles were fully open 
and looked around. Bellatrix was almo
st at the telephone lift at the 
"other end of the hall, but she looked "
"back as he sprinted toward her, "
and aimed another spell at him. He
 dodged behind the Fountain of 
Magical Brethren; the spell zoomed 
past him and hit the wrought gold 
gates at the other end of the Atrium so
 that they rang like bells. There 
were no more footsteps. She had 
stopped running. He crouched be-
"hind the statues, listening. "
“
"Come out, come out, little Harry"
"!” she called in her mock-baby voice, "
which echoed off the polished wood
en floors. “What did you come af-
"ter me for, then? I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin!” "
"“I am!” shouted Harry, and a score of ghostly Harry’s seemed to "
chorus 
I am
! 
I am
! 
I am
! all around the room. 
“Aaaaaah . . . did you 
love
" him, little baby Potter?” "
Hatred rose in Harry such as he 
had never known before. He flung 
himself out from behind th
e fountain and bellowed “
Crucio
!” 
Bellatrix screamed. The spell had 
"knocked her off her feet, but she "
did not writhe and shriek with pain
 as Neville had — she was already 
"on her feet again, breathless, no"
 longer laughing
. Harry dodged be-
hind the golden fountain again — her 
counterspell hit the head of the 
"handsome wizard, which was blown "
"off and landed twenty feet away, "
gouging long scratches 
into the wooden floor. 
“Never used an Unforgivable Cu
"rse before, have you, boy?” she "
yelled. She had abandoned her ba
by voice now. “You need to 
mean
"them, Potter! You need to really want"
 to cause pain — to enjoy it — 
righteous anger won’t hurt me for long — I’ll show you how it is 
"done, shall I? I’ll gi"
ve you a lesson —” 
Harry had been edging around the 
fountain on the other side. She 
"screamed, “"
Crucio
!” and he was forced to duck down again as the cen-
   811 "taur’s arm, holding its bow, spun "
off and landed with a crash on the 
floor a short distan
ce from the golden wizard’s head. 
"“Potter, you cannot win against me!”"
 she cried. He could hear her 
"moving to the right, trying to get a clear shot of him. He backed "
"around the statue away from her, "
"crouching behind the centaur’s legs, "
his head level with the house-elf’s.
 “I was and am the Dark Lord’s 
"most loyal servant, I learned the Dark Arts from him, and I know "
"spells of such power that you, path"
"etic little boy, can never hope to "
compete —” 
“
Stupefy
!” yelled Harry. He had edged 
right around to where the 
goblin stood beaming up at the now 
headless wizard and taken aim at 
her back as she peered around the fountain for him. She reacted so fast 
he barely had time to duck. 
“
Protego
!” 
"The jet of red light, his own Stunni"
"ng Spell, bounced back at him. "
Harry scrambled back behind the fo
"untain, and one of the goblin’s "
ears went flying across the room. 
"“Potter, I am going to give you one chance!” shouted Bellatrix. "
“Give me the prophecy — roll it
 out toward me now — and I may 
spare your life!” 
"“Well, you’re going to have to "
"kill me, because it’s gone!” Harry "
"roared — and as he shouted it, pain seared across his forehead. His "
"scar was on fire again, and he fel"
t a surge of fury that was quite un-
connected with his own rage. “And he
 knows!” said Harry with a mad 
laugh to match Bellatrix’s own. “Y
our dear old mate Voldemort knows 
it’s gone! He’s not going to 
"be happy with you, is he?” "
“What? What do you mean?” she crie
"d, and for the first time there "
was fear in her voice. 
“The prophecy smashed when I was trying to get Neville up the 
steps! What do you think Voldem
"ort’ll say about that, then?” "
His scar seared and burned. . . . Th
e pain of it was making his eyes 
stream. . . . 
 812 "“LIAR!” she shrieked, but he could "
hear the terror behind the anger 
"now. “YOU’VE GOT IT, POTTER, AND YOU WILL GIVE IT "
TO ME — 
Accio Prophecy
! 
ACCIO PROPHECY
!” 
Harry laughed again because he k
"new it would incense her, the "
pain building in his head so badl
y he thought his skull might burst. 
He waved his empty hand from 
behind the one-ea
red goblin and 
withdrew it quickly as she sent anot
her jet of green light flying at him. 
“Nothing there!” he shouted. 
“Nothing to summon! It smashed 
and nobody heard what it sa
"id, tell your boss that —” "
"“No!” she screamed. “It isn’t true, you’re lying — MASTER, I "
"TRIED, I TRIED — DO "
NOT PUNISH ME —” 
"“Don’t waste your breath!” yelled Harry, his eyes screwed up against "
"the pain in his scar, now more terrible than ever. “He can’t hear you "
from here!” 
"“Can’t I, Potter?” said a high, cold voice. "
Harry opened his eyes. 
"Tall, thin, and black-hooded, his "
terrible snakelike face white and 
"gaunt, his scarlet, slit-pupiled ey"
es staring . . . Lord Voldemort had 
"appeared in the middle of the hall,"
 his wand pointing at Harry who 
"stood frozen, quite unable to move. "
“So you smashed my prophecy?” sa
"id Voldemort softly, staring at "
"Harry with those pitiless red eyes. “No, "
"Bella, he is not lying. . . . I see "
the truth looking at me from within
 his worthless mind. . . . Months 
"of preparation, months of effort . . . and my Death Eaters have let "
Harry Potter thwart me again. . . .” 
"“Master, I am sorry, I knew not,"
 I was fighting the Animagus 
"Black!” sobbed Bellatrix, flinging "
herself down at Voldemort’s feet as 
he paced slowly nearer. “Mas
"ter, you should know —” "
"“Be quiet, Bella,” said Voldemort "
dangerously. “I shall deal with 
you in a moment. Do you think I ha
ve entered the Ministry of Magic 
to hear your sniveling apologies?” 
“But Master — he is he
re — he is below —” 
   813 Voldemort paid no attention. 
“I have nothing more to say to yo
"u, Potter,” he said quietly. “You "
have irked me too of
"ten, for too long. "
AVADA KEDAVRA
!” 
Harry had not even opened his mout
h to resist. His mind was 
"blank, his wand pointing "
uselessly at the floor. 
But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had 
"sprung alive, leaping from its plin"
"th, and landed on the floor with a "
crash between Harry and Voldemort. 
The spell merely glanced off its 
chest as the statue flung out 
"its arms, protecting Harry. "
"“What — ?” said Voldemort, staring around. And then he "
"breathed, “Dumbledore!” "
"Harry looked behind him, his heart pounding. Dumbledore was "
standing in front of
 the golden gates. 
Voldemort raised his wand and sent
 another jet of green light at 
"Dumbledore, who turned and was go"
ne in a whirling of his cloak; 
next second he had reappeared 
behind Voldemort and waved his 
wand toward the remnants of the fountain; the other statues sprang to 
life too. The statue of the witch ra
"n at Bellatrix, who screamed and "
sent spells streaming uselessly off its 
"chest, before it dived at her, pin-"
"ning her to the floor. Meanwhile, th"
e goblin and the ho
use-elf scuttled 
toward the fireplaces set along th
"e wall, and the one-armed centaur "
"galloped at Voldemort, who vanished"
 and reappeared beside the pool. 
The headless statue thrust Harry back
"ward, away from the fight, as "
Dumbledore advanced on
 Voldemort and the 
golden centaur can-
tered around them both. 
"“It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,” said Dumbledore "
calmly. “The Aurors 
are on their way —” 
"“By which time I shall be gone, an"
d you dead!” spat Voldemort. He 
"sent another Killing Curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting "
the security guar
"ds desk, which bu"
rst into flame. 
Dumbledore flicked his own wand. Th
e force of the spell that em-
anated from it was such that Ha
"rry, though shielded by his stone "
 814 "guard, felt his hair stand on end as"
" it passed, and this time Voldemort "
was forced to conjure a shining silver
 shield out of thin air to deflect 
"it. The spell, whatever it was, caus"
"ed no visible damage to the shield, "
"though a deep, gonglike note reverb"
"erated from it, an oddly chilling "
sound. . . . 
"“You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his "
scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of 
"the shield. “Above such brutality, "
are you?” 
“We both know that there are ot
"her ways of destroying a man, "
"Tom,” Dumbledore said calmly, cont"
inuing to walk toward Volde-
mort as though he had not a fear in
" the world, as though nothing had "
happened to interrupt his stroll up 
the hall. “Merely ta
king your life 
"would not satisfy me, I admit —” "
“There is nothing worse than
" death, Dumbledore!” snarled "
Voldemort. 
"“You are quite wrong,” said Dumbledore, still closing in upon "
Voldemort and speaking as lightly as
 though they were discussing the 
matter over drinks. Harry 
felt scared to see him
" walking along, unde-"
"fended, shieldless. He wanted to c"
"ry out a warning, but his headless "
guard kept shunting him backward
" toward the wall, blocking his "
every attempt to get out from behin
"d it. “Indeed, your failure to un-"
derstand that there are things much
 worse than death has always been 
your greatest weakness —” 
Another jet of green light flew from
 behind the silver shield. This 
"time it was the one-armed centaur, "
"galloping in front of Dumbledore, "
"that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the "
fragments had even hit the floor
", Dumbledore had drawn back his "
wand and waved it as though bran
dishing a whip. A long thin flame 
flew from the tip; it wrapped itself
" around Voldemort, shield and all. "
"For a moment, it seemed Dumble"
"dore had won, but then the fiery "
"rope became a serpent, which reli"
nquished its hold upon Voldemort 
"at once and turned, hissing fu"
"riously, to face Dumbledore. "
   815 Voldemort vanished. The snake re
"ared from the floor, ready to "
strike — 
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as 
"Voldemort reappeared, standing on "
the plinth in the middle of the 
pool where so recently th
e five statues had stood. 
“
Look out
!” Harry yelled. 
"But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at "
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand
 and the snake 
had struck — 
"Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak "
"wide, and swallowed the jet of green light whole. He burst into flame "
"and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled"
", and flightless. At the same mo-"
"ment, Dumbledore brandished his "
"wand in one, long, fluid move-"
"ment — the snake, which had been "
an instant from sinking its fangs 
"into him, flew high into the air and "
vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; 
the water in the pool rose up and 
covered Voldemort like a cocoon of 
molten glass — 
For a few seconds Voldemort was vi
"sible only as a dark, rippling, "
"faceless figure, shimmering and indi"
"stinct upon the plinth, clearly "
struggling to throw off 
the suffocating mass — 
"Then he was gone, and the water fell with a crash back into its "
"pool, slopping wildly ov"
"er the sides, drenching the polished floor. "
“MASTER!” screamed Bellatrix. 
"Sure it was over, sure Voldemort had decided to flee, Harry made to "
run out from behind his statue 
"guard, but Dumbledore bellowed, "
"“Stay where you are, Harry!” "
"For the first time, Dumbledore sounded frightened. Harry could "
not see why. The hall was quite em
pty but for themse
"lves, the sobbing "
Bellatrix still trapped under her st
"atue, and the tiny baby Fawkes "
croaking feebly on the floor — 
And then Harry’s scar burst open. 
He knew he was dead: it was 
"pain beyond imagining, "
pain past endurance — 
"He was gone from the hall, he was "
locked in the coils of a creature 
 816 "with red eyes, so tightly bound th"
at Harry did not know where his 
"body ended and the creature’s began. They were fused together, "
"bound by pain, and th"
ere was no escape — 
"And when the creature spoke, it us"
"ed Harry’s mouth, so that in his "
agony he felt hi
s jaw move. . . . 
“
"Kill me now, Dumbledore."
 . . .” 
"Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry "
felt the creature us
e him again. . . . 
“
"If death is nothing, "
"Dumbledore, kill the boy."
 . . .” 
"Let the pain stop,"
 thought Harry. 
"Let him kill us. . . . End it, Dumb-"
ledore. . . . Death is nothing compared to this.
 . . . 
And I’ll see Sirius again.
 . . . 
And as Harry’s heart filled with em
"otion, the creature’s coils loos-"
"ened, the pain was gone, Harry was "
"lying facedown on the floor, his "
"glasses gone, shivering as though he lay upon ice, not wood. . . . "
And there were voices echoing thro
"ugh the hall, more voices than "
there should have been: Harry opened 
"his eyes, saw his glasses lying at "
the heel of the headless statue that
" had been guarding him, but which "
"now lay flat on its back, cracked "
and immobile. He 
put them on and 
raised his head an inch to find
 Dumbledore’s crooked nose inches 
from his own. 
"“Are you all right, Harry?” "
"“Yes,” said Harry, shaking so viol"
ently he could not hold his head 
"up properly. “Yeah, I’m — where’s Voldemort, where — who are all "
these — what’s —” 
The Atrium was full of people. Th
e floor was reflecting emerald-
"green flames that had burst into life in all the fireplaces along one wall, "
and a stream of witches and wiza
rds was emerging from them. As 
Dumbledore pulled him back to his feet
", Harry saw the tiny gold stat-"
ues of the house-elf and the gobl
in leading a stunned-looking Cor-
nelius Fudge forward. 
“He was there!” shouted a scarlet-
"robed man with a ponytail, who "
   817 was pointing at a pile of golden rubb
"le on the other side of the hall, "
where Bellatrix had lain trapped 
"moments before. “I saw him, Mr. "
"Fudge, I swear, it was You-Know-Who, he grabbed a woman and "
Disapparated!” 
"“I know, Williamson, I know, I sa"
"w him too!” gibbered Fudge, who "
was wearing pajamas under his pins
triped cloak and was gasping as 
though he had just run miles. “Merlin’s beard — here — 
here
! — in 
the Ministry of Magic! — great he
avens above — it 
doesn’t seem pos-
sible — my word — 
how can this be?” 
"“If you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries, Cor-"
"nelius,” said Dumbledor"
"e, apparently satisf"
ied that Harry was all 
"right, and walking forward so that"
 the newcomers realized he was 
there for the first time (a few of th
"em raised their wands, others sim-"
ply looked amazed; the statues of 
the elf and goblin applauded and 
Fudge jumped so much that his slippe
"r-clad feet left the floor), “you "
will find several escaped Death Ea
ters contained in the Death Cham-
"ber, bound by an Anti-Disapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision "
as to what to 
do with them.” 
"“Dumbledore!” gasped Fudge, a"
pparently beside himself with 
amazement. “You — 
here — I — I —” 
He looked wildly around at the 
"Aurors he had brought with him, "
and it could not have been clearer that
" he was in half a mind to cry, "
“Seize him!” 
"“Cornelius, I am ready to fight your men — and win again!” said "
Dumbledore in a thunderous voice.
 “But a few minutes ago you saw 
"proof, with your own eyes, that I ha"
ve been telling you the truth for a 
"year. Lord Voldemort has returned, "
you have been chasing the wrong 
"men for twelve months, and it is"
 time you listened to sense!” 
“I — don’t — well —” blustered Fu
"dge, looking around as though "
hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do. When nobody 
"did, he said, “Very well — Dawlis"
h! Williamson! Go down to the De-
"partment of Mysteries and see . . . Dumbledore, you — you will need "
 818 to tell me exactly — the Fountain
 of Magical Brethren — what hap-
pened?” he added in a kind of whim
"per, staring around at the floor, "
where the remains of the statues of
" the witch, wizard, and centaur "
now lay scattered. 
“We can discuss that after I have
" sent Harry back to Hogwarts,” "
said Dumbledore. 
“Harry — 
Harry Potter
?” 
Fudge spun around and stared at
" Harry, who was still standing "
against the wall beside the fallen 
statue that had been guarding him 
during Dumbledore an
d Voldemort’s duel. 
“He-here?” said Fudge. “Why
 — what’s all this about?” 
"“I shall explain everything,” repe"
"ated Dumbledore, “when Harry is "
back at school.” 
He walked away from the pool 
to the place where the golden wiz-
"ard’s head lay on the floor. He pointed his wand at it and muttered, "
“
Portus.
” The head glowed blue and 
trembled noisil
y against the 
"wooden floor for a few seconds, "
then became still once more. 
"“Now see here, Dumbledore!” said Fudge, as Dumbledore picked "
up the head and walked back to 
Harry carrying it. “Y
ou haven’t got 
authorization for that Portkey! You can’t do things like that right in 
front of the Mini
"ster of Magic, you — you —” "
His voice faltered as Dumbledore 
surveyed him magisterially over 
his half-moon spectacles. 
“You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hog-
"warts,” said Dumbledore. “You will tell your Aurors to stop searching "
for my Care of Magical Creatures te
acher so that he can return to 
work. I will give you . . .” Dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve 
hands from his pocket and glanced at
" it, “half an hour of my time "
"tonight, in which I think we shall be"
 more than able to cover the im-
portant points of what has happened
" here. After that, I shall need to "
"return to my school. If you need more help from me you are, of  "
   819 "course, more than welcome to cont"
act me at Hogwarts. Letters ad-
dressed to the headmast
er will find me.” 
Fudge goggled worse than ever. His mouth was open and his round 
face grew pinker under 
his rumpled gray hair. 
“I — you —” 
Dumbledore turned 
his back on him. 
"“Take this Portkey, Harry.” "
He held out the golden head of
" the statue, and Harry placed his "
"hand upon it, past caring what he did next or where he went. "
"“I shall see you in half an hour,”"
 said Dumbledore quietly. “One 
. . . two . . . three . . .” 
Harry felt the familiar sensation of
 a hook being jerked behind his 
navel. The polished wooden floor 
was gone from beneath his feet; the 
"Atrium, Fudge, and Dumbledore had "
"all disappeared, and he was fly-"
ing forward in a whirlwind 
of color and sound. . . . 
Harry’s feet hit solid ground agai
n; his knees buckled a little 
and the golden wizard’s head fell with a resounding 
clunk
 to 
the floor. He looked around and sa
w that he had arrived in Dumble-
dore’s office. 
Everything seemed to have repaired
 itself during the headmaster’s 
absence. The delicate silver inst
ruments stood again 
upon the spindle-
"legged tables, puffing and whirring"
 serenely. The portraits of the 
headmasters and headmistresses were
" snoozing in their frames, heads "
lolling back in armchairs or agains
t the edge of their pictures. Harry 
looked through the window. There wa
s a cool line of pale green along 
the horizon: Dawn was approaching. 
"The silence and the stillness, broken only by the occasional grunt or "
"snuffle of a sleeping portrait, wa"
s unbearable to him. If his sur-
roundings could have reflected the 
"feelings inside him, the pictures "
"would have been screaming in pain. He walked around the quiet, "
"beautiful office, breathing quickly, t"
rying not to think. But he had to 
think. . . . There wa
s no escape. . . . 
"It was his fault Sirius had died; it was all his fault. If he, Harry, had "
H 
   821 not been stupid enough to fall for 
"Voldemort’s trick, if he had not "
been so convinced that what he had 
"seen in his dream was real, if he "
had only opened his mind to the po
"ssibility that Voldemort was, as "
"Hermione had said, "
banking on Harry’s 
love of playing the hero
 . . . 
"It was unbearable, he would not th"
"ink about it, he could not stand "
it. . . . There was a terri
ble hollow inside him he
 did not want to feel 
"or examine, a dark hole where Siri"
"us had been, where Sirius had van-"
ished. He did not want 
to have to be alone wi
"th that great, silent "
"space, he could "
not stand it — 
A picture behind him gave
" a particularly loud grunting snore, and "
"a cool voice said, “Ah . "
. . Harry Potter . . .” 
Phineas Nigellus gave a long ya
"wn, stretching his arms as he "
watched Harry with sh
"rewd, narrow eyes. "
“And what brings you here in the 
early hours of th
e morning?” said 
Phineas. “This office is supposed to
 be barred to all but the rightful 
"headmaster. Or has Dumbledore sent you here? Oh, don’t tell me . . .” "
He gave another shuddering yawn. “Another message for my worth-
less great-great-grandson?” 
Harry could not speak. Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius 
"was dead, but Harry could not tell hi"
m. To say it aloud would be to 
"make it final, absolute, irretrievable. "
A few more of the portraits had st
irred now. Terror of being inter-
rogated made Harry stride across 
the room and seize the doorknob. 
It would not turn. He was shut in. 
"“I hope this means,” said the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who "
hung on the wall behi
"nd Dumbledore’s desk, “that Dumbledore will "
soon be back
 with us?” 
Harry turned. The wizard was eyeing him with great interest. Harry 
nodded. He tugged again on the 
"doorknob behind his back, but it "
remained immovable. 
"“Oh good,” said the wizard. “It ha"
"s been very dull without him, "
very dull indeed.” 
 822 He settled himself on the throne
like chair on which he had been 
painted and smiled be
nignly upon Harry. 
"“Dumbledore thinks very highly of you, as I am sure you know,” he "
said comfortably. “Oh yes. 
Holds you in great esteem.” 
The guilt filling the whole of Har
"ry’s chest like some monstrous, "
weighty parasite now writhed an
d squirmed. Harry could not stand 
"this, he could not stand being Harry "
anymore. . . . He had never felt 
more trapped inside his own head an
"d body, never wished so intensely "
that he could be somebody
 — anybody — else. . . . 
The empty fireplace burst into em
"erald-green flame, making Harry "
"leap away from the door, staring at "
the man spinning inside the grate. 
As Dumbledore’s tall form unfolded 
"itself from the fire, the wizards "
and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake. Many of them 
gave cries of welcome. 
"“Thank you,” said Dumbledore softly. "
"He did not look at Harry at first,"
 but walked over to the perch be-
"side the door and withdrew, from an"
" inside pocket of his robes, the "
"tiny, ugly, featherless Fawkes, whom "
he placed gently on the tray of 
soft ashes beneath the golden post
 where the full-grown Fawkes usu-
ally stood. 
"“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, "
finally turning away from the 
"baby bird, “you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow stu-"
dents are going to suffer lasting 
damage from the night’s events.” 
"Harry tried to say “Good,” but no sound came out. It seemed to "
him that Dumbledore was reminding 
him of the amount of damage 
"he had caused by his actions tonight, and although Dumbledore was "
"for once looking at him directly, an"
d though his expression was kindly 
"rather than accusatory, Harry co"
uld not bear to meet his eyes. 
"“Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up now,” said Dumble-"
dore. “Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St. 
"Mungo’s, but it seems that she "
will make a full recovery.” 
   823 Harry contented himself with noddi
"ng at the carpet, which was "
growing lighter as the sky outside grew
 paler. He was sure that all the 
portraits around the room were li
stening eagerly to every word Dum-
"bledore spoke, wondering where Dumbledore and Harry had been "
and why there had been injuries. 
"“I know how you are feeling, "
"Harry,” said Dumbledore very "
quietly. 
"“No, you don’t,” said Harry, and "
his voice was suddenly loud and 
strong. White-hot anger leapt 
inside him. Dumbledore knew 
nothing
about his feelings. 
"“You see, Dumbledore?” said Phinea"
s Nigellus slyly. “Never try to 
understand the students. They hate it. They would much rather be 
"tragically misunderstood, wallow in "
"self-pity, stew in their own —” "
"“That’s enough, Phinea"
"s,” said Dumbledore. "
Harry turned his back on Dumb
ledore and stared determinedly 
out of the opposite window. He co
uld see the Quidditch stadium in 
the distance. Sirius had appeared th
"ere once, disguised as the shaggy "
"black dog, so he could watch Harry "
play. . . . He had probably come 
to see whether Harry was as good as
 James had been. . . . Harry had 
never asked him. . . . 
“There is no shame in what yo
"u are feeling, Harry,"
” said Dumble-
dore’s voice. “On the contrary . . . the 
fact that you can feel pain like 
this is your grea
test strength.” 
Harry felt the white-hot anger lick his
" insides, blazing in the terri-"
"ble emptiness, filling him with the desire to hurt Dumbledore for his "
calmness and his empty words. 
"“My greatest strength, is it?” sa"
"id Harry, his voice shaking as he "
"stared out at the Quidditch stadium, "
no longer seeing it. “You haven’t 
got a clue. . . . You don’t know . . .” 
“What don’t I know?” as
ked Dumbledore calmly. 
It was too much. Harry turned
" around, shaking with rage. "
 824 “I don’t want to talk ab
"out how I feel, all right?” "
"“Harry, suffering like this proves "
you are still a man! This pain is 
part of being human —” 
“THEN — I — DON’T — WANT — TO — BE — HUMAN!” 
"Harry roared, and he seized one of th"
e delicate silver 
instruments from 
the spindle-legged table beside hi
m and flung it across the room. It 
shattered into a hundred tiny pieces
 against the wall. Several of the 
pictures let out yells of anger and 
"fright, and the port"
rait of Armando 
"Dippet said, “"
Really
!” 
“I DON’T CARE!” Harry yelled at
" them, snatching up a luna-"
scope and throwing it into th
"e fireplace. “I’VE HAD ENOUGH, "
"I’VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I "
DON’T CARE ANYMORE —” 
He seized the table on which th
e silver instrum
ent had stood and 
threw that too. It broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in dif-
ferent directions. 
"“You do care,” said Dumbledore. He had not flinched or made a "
single move to stop Harry demolis
hing his office. His expression was 
"calm, almost detached. “You care so much you feel as though you will "
bleed to death with 
the pain of it.” 
"“I — DON’T!” Harry screamed, so "
loudly that he felt his throat 
"might tear, and for a second he wanted to rush at Dumbledore and "
break him too; shatter that calm ol
"d face, shake him, hurt him, make "
him feel some tiny part of
 the horror inside Harry. 
"“Oh yes, you do,” said "
"Dumbledore, still more"
 calmly. “You have 
"now lost your mother, your father, "
and the closest thing to a parent 
you have ever known. Of course you care.” 
“YOU DON’T KNOW HOW I FEEL!” Harry roared. “YOU — 
STANDING THERE — YOU —” 
But words were no longer enough
", smashing things was no more "
"help. He wanted to run, he wanted"
 to keep running and never look 
"back, he wanted to be somewhere he"
 could not see the clear blue eyes 
   825 "staring at him, that hatefully calm "
old face. He ran to
" the door, seized "
"the doorknob again, an"
d wrenched at it. 
But the door would not open. 
Harry turned back to Dumbledore. 
"“Let me out,” he said. He was shaking from head to foot. "
"“No,” said Dumbledore simply. "
For a few seconds they st
ared at each other. 
"“Let me out,” Harry said again. "
"“No,” Dumbledore repeated. "
“If you don’t — if you keep me in
 here — if you don’t let me —” 
“By all means continue destroying
" my possessions,” said Dumble-"
dore serenely. “I daresay I have too many.” 
He walked around his desk an
"d sat down behind it, watching "
Harry. 
"“Let me out,” Harry said yet again, "
in a voice that was cold and al-
most as calm as Dumbledore’s. 
“Not until I have had my
" say,” said Dumbledore. "
“Do you — do you think I want to
 — do you think I give a — I 
DON’T CARE WHAT YOU’VE GOT 
TO SAY!” Harry roared. “I 
don’t want to hear 
anything
 you’ve got to say!” 
"“You will,” said Dumb"
ledore sadly. “Because you are not nearly as 
angry with me as you ought to be. If
" you are to attack me, as I know "
"you are close to doing, I would like "
to have thoroughly earned it.” 
“What are you talking — ?” 
“It is 
my
" fault that Sirius died,” said Dumbledore clearly. “Or I "
should say almost entirely my fault 
— I will not be so arrogant as to 
claim responsibility for the whole. 
"Sirius was a brave, clever, and ener-"
"getic man, and such men are not usua"
lly content to sit at home in hid-
"ing while they believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should "
never have believed for an instant 
that there was any necessity for you 
to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight. If I had been open with 
"you, Harry, as I should have been, "
you would have known a long time 
 826 ago that Voldemort might try and 
lure you to the Department of 
"Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there "
tonight. And Sirius would not have
 had to come after you. That 
"blame lies with me, "
and with me alone.” 
Harry was still standing with his ha
nd on the doorknob but he was 
unaware of it. He was gazing at 
"Dumbledore, hardly breathing, lis-"
tening yet barely understanding what he was hearing. 
"“Please sit down,” said Dumbledore. "
"It was not an order, it was a "
request. 
"Harry hesitated, then walked slow"
ly across the room now littered 
with silver cogs and fragments of 
wood and took the seat facing Dum-
bledore’s desk. 
"“Am I to understand,” said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harry’s "
"left, “that my great-great-grandson"
 — the last of the Blacks — is 
dead?” 
"“Yes, Phineas,” said Dumbledore. "
"“I don’t believe it,” said Phineas brusquely. "
Harry turned his head in time to
 see Phineas marching out of his 
portrait and knew that he had go
ne to visit his other painting in 
"Grimmauld Place. He would walk, perh"
"aps, from portra"
"it to portrait, "
calling for Sirius thro
ugh the house. . . . 
"“Harry, I owe you an explanation,” said Dumbledore. “An explana-"
tion of an old man’s mistakes. For 
"I see now that what I have done, "
"and not done, with regard to you, "
bears all the hallmarks of the fail-
ings of age. Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men 
are guilty if they forget 
what it was to be young 
. . . and I seem to have 
forgotten lately. . . .” 
The sun was rising properly now.
 There was a rim of dazzling or-
ange visible over the mountains and 
the sky above it was colorless and 
bright. The light fell upon Dumbledor
"e, upon the silver of his eye-"
"brows and beard, upon the lines "
gouged deeply into his face. 
"“I guessed, fifteen years ago,” said Dumbledore, “when I saw the "
   827 "scar upon your forehead, what it "
might mean. I guessed that it might 
be the sign of a connection fo
rged between you and Voldemort.” 
"“You’ve told me this before, Pro"
"fessor,” said Harry bluntly. He did "
not care about being rude. He did no
t care about anything very much 
anymore. 
"“Yes,” said Dumbledore apologetically. “Yes, but you see — it is "
necessary to start with your scar. Fo
"r it became apparent, shortly after "
"you rejoined the magical world, that I was correct, and that your scar "
was giving you warnings when Voldem
"ort was close to you, or else "
feeling powerful emotion.” 
"“I know,” said Harry wearily. "
“And this ability of yours — to 
"detect Voldemort’s presence, even "
"when he is disguised, and to know what he is feeling when his emo-"
tions are roused — has become more and more pronounced since 
Voldemort returned to his own 
body and his full powers.” 
Harry did not bother 
to nod. He knew al
l of this already. 
"“More recently,” said Dumbledo"
"re, “I became concerned that "
Voldemort might realize that this 
connection between you exists. Sure 
"enough, there came a time when you "
entered so far into his mind and 
thoughts that he sensed your presenc
"e. I am speaking, of course, of the "
night when you witnessed th
e attack on 
Mr. Weasley.” 
"“Yeah, Snape told me,” Harry muttered. "
“
Professor
" Snape, Harry,” Dumbledore "
corrected him quietly. “But 
did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you? Why 
I did not teach yo
u Occlumency? Why I had no
t so much as looked 
at you for months?” 
Harry looked up. He could see now that Dumbledore looked sad 
and tired. 
"“Yeah,” Harry mumbled. “Yeah, I wondered.” "
"“You see,” continued Dumbledore he"
avily “I believed it could not 
be long before Voldemort attempted 
"to force his way into your mind, "
"to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager to "
 828 give him more incentives to do so. I 
was sure that if 
he realized that 
our relationship was — or had ever 
been — closer than that of head-
"master and pupil, he would seize hi"
s chance to use you as a means to 
spy on me. I feared the uses to wh
ich he would put yo
"u, the possibil-"
ity that he might try and possess yo
"u. Harry, I believe I was right to "
think that Voldemort woul
d have made use of you in such a way. On 
those rare occasions when we had 
"close contact, I thought I saw a "
shadow of him stir behind your eyes
". . . . I was trying, in distancing "
"myself from you, to protect yo"
u. An old man’s 
mistake . . .” 
Harry remembered the feeling that 
a dormant snake had risen in 
"him, ready to strike, on those "
occasions when he and Dumbledore 
made eye contact. 
"“Voldemort’s aim in possessing you, as he demonstrated tonight, "
would not have been my destruction. It would have been yours. He 
"hoped, when he possessed you briefly a short while ago, that I would "
sacrifice you in the hope of killing him.” 
He sighed deeply. Harry was lett
ing the words wash over him. He 
"would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago, and "
now it was meaningless compared to 
the gaping chasm inside him that 
"was the loss of Sirius, no"
ne of it mattered . . . 
“Sirius told me that you felt Vold
emort awake inside you the very 
night that you had the vision of Ar
thur Weasley’s attack. I knew at 
once that my worst fears were corre
ct: Voldemort from that point had 
realized he could use you. In an
 attempt to arm you against Volde-
"mort’s assaults on your mind, I "
arranged Occlumency lessons with 
Professor Snape.” 
He paused. Harry watched the sunl
"ight, which was sliding slowly "
across the polished surface of Dumb
"ledore’s desk, illuminate a silver "
ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill. Harry could tell that the por-
traits all around them were awak
e and listening raptly to Dumble-
dore’s explanation. He could hear th
"e occasional rustle of robes, the "
slight clearing of a th
roat. Phineas Nigellus had still not returned. . . . 
   829 "“Professor Snape discovered,” Dumbledore resumed, “that you had "
been dreaming about the door to 
the Department of Mysteries for 
"months. Voldemort, of course, had b"
een obsessed with the possibility of 
"hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body, and as he dwelled "
"on the door, so did you, though "
you did not know 
what it meant. 
"“And then you saw Rookwood, who "
worked in the Department of 
"Mysteries before his arrest, tellin"
g Voldemort what we had known all 
along — that the prophecies held in
 the Ministry of Magic are heavily 
protected. Only the people to whom 
they refer can lift them from the 
shelves without suffering madness. In
" this case, either Voldemort him-"
self would have to enter the Mini
stry of Magic and risk revealing 
himself at last — or else you would have to take it for him. It became 
a matter of even greater urgency that you should master Occlumency.” 
"“But I didn’t,” muttered Harry. He sa"
id it aloud to try and ease the 
dead weight of guilt inside him; a confession must surely relieve some 
"of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart. “I didn’t practice, I didn’t "
"bother, I could’ve stopped myself"
" having those dreams, Hermione "
"kept telling me to do it, if I had he"
’d never have been able to show me 
"where to go, and — Sirius wouldn’t — Sirius wouldn’t —” "
Something was erupting inside Ha
rry’s head: a need to justify him-
"self, to explain — "
“I tried to check he’d really tak
"en Sirius, I went to Umbridge’s of-"
"fice, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire, "
"and he said Sirius wasn’t there, he "
said he’d gone!” 
"“Kreacher lied,” said Dumbledore "
"calmly. “You are not his master, "
he could lie to you without even need
ing to punish himself. Kreacher 
intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic.” 
“He — he sent me on purpose?” 
"“Oh yes. Kreacher, I am afraid, has been serving more than one "
master for months.” 
“How?” said Harry blankly. “He 
hasn’t been out of Grimmauld 
Place for years.” 
 830 “Kreacher seized his opportunity 
"shortly before Christmas,” said "
"Dumbledore, “when Sirius, apparently"
", shouted at him to ‘get out.’ "
He took Sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the 
house. He went to the only Blac
k family member for whom he had 
any respect left. . . . Black’s cousin 
"Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife "
of Lucius Malfoy.” 
“How do you know all this?” Harr
y said. His heart was beating very 
fast. He felt sick. He remember
ed worrying about Kreacher’s odd 
"absence over Christmas, remembered him turning up again in the "
attic. . . . 
"“Kreacher told me last night,” said Dumbledore. “You see, when "
you gave Professor Snape that crypti
"c warning, he realized that you "
had had a vision of Sirius trapped in
 the bowels of the Department of 
"Mysteries. He, like you, attempted to contact Sirius at once. I should "
explain that members of the Order of
 the Phoenix have more reliable 
methods of communicating than the fire in Dolores Umbridge’s of-
fice. Professor Snape found that Si
rius was alive and safe in Grim-
mauld Place. 
"“When, however, you did not return from your trip into the forest "
"with Dolores Umbridge, Professor Sn"
ape grew worried that you still 
believed Sirius to be a captive of 
Lord Voldemort’s. He alerted certain 
Order members at once.” 
Dumbledore heaved a great sigh 
"and then said, “Alastor Moody, "
"Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shackl"
"ebolt, and Remus Lupin were at "
headquarters when he made contact. 
All agreed to go to your aid at 
once. Professor Snape requested that

needed somebody to remain at headqu
arters to tell me what had hap-
"pened, for I was due there at any "
"moment. In the meantime he, Pro-"
"fessor Snape, intend"
ed to search the 
forest for you. 
“But Sirius did not wish to remain
 behind while the others went to 
search for you. He delegated to Krea
cher the task of telling me what 
had happened. And so it
 was that when I arrived in Grimmauld Place 
   831 "shortly after they had all left for the Ministry, it was the elf who told "
me — laughing fit to burst — where Sirius had gone.” 
“He was laughing?” said 
Harry in a hollow voice. 
"“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore. “You s"
"ee, Kreacher was not able to be-"
tray us totally. He is not Secret-K
"eeper for the Order, he could not "
give the Malfoys our whereabouts or 
tell them any of the Order’s con-
fidential plans that he had been fo
rbidden to reveal. He was bound by 
"the enchantments of his kind, which "
is to say that he could not dis-
obey a direct order from his mast
"er, Sirius. But he gave Narcissa "
information of the sort that is very
" valuable to Voldemort, yet must "
have seemed much too trivial for Si
rius to think of banning him from 
repeating it.” 
“Like what?” said Harry. 
“Like the fact that the person Siri
us cared most about in the world 
"was you,” said Dumbledore quietly. "
“Like the fact that you were com-
ing to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother. Voldemort 
"knew already, of course, that Sirius"
" was in the Order, that you knew "
where he was — but Kreacher’s information made him realize that the 
one person whom you would go to 
any lengths to rescue was Sirius 
Black.” 
Harry’s lips were
 cold and numb. 
“So . . . when I asked Kreacher if 
Sirius was there last night . . .” 
“The Malfoys — undoubtedly on 
Voldemort’s instructions — had 
told him he must find a way of keep
ing Sirius out of the way once you 
had seen the vision of Sirius being 
"tortured. Then, if you decided to "
check whether Sirius was at home or
" not, Kreacher would be able to "
pretend he was not. Kreacher injured Buckbeak the hippogriff yester-
"day, and at the moment when you ma"
"de your appearance in the fire, "
Sirius was upstairs trying to tend to him.” 
"There seemed to be very little air in Harry’s lungs, his breathing was "
quick and shallow. 
“And Kreacher told you all this 
. . . and laughed?” he croaked. 
 832 "“He did not wish to tell me,” sa"
id Dumbledore. “But I am a suffi-
ciently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied 
to and I — persuaded him — 
to tell me the full st
"ory, before I left for "
the Department of Mysteries.” 
"“And,” whispered Harry, his hands cu"
"rled in cold fists on his knees, "
“and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him —” 
"“She was quite right, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I warned Sirius "
when we adopted twelve Grimmauld 
Place as our headquarters that 
Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect. I also told him 
that Kreacher could be dangerous to us. I do not think that Sirius 
"took me very seriously, or that he "
ever saw Kreacher as a being with 
feelings as acute as a humans —” 
“Don’t you blame — don’t you — 
talk — about Sirius like —” 
"Harry’s breath was constricted, he "
could not get the words out prop-
erly. But the rage that had subsided 
so briefly had flared in him again; 
he would not let Dumbledore criticize Sirius. “Kreacher’s a lying — 
foul — he deserved —” 
“Kreacher is what he 
has been made by wiza
"rds, Harry,” said Dum-"
"bledore. “Yes, he is to be pitied. "
His existence has been as miserable as 
your friend Dobby’s. He was forced 
"to do Sirius’s bidding, because Sir-"
ius was the last of the family to wh
"ich he was enslaved, but he felt no "
true loyalty to him. And whatever Kr
"eacher’s faults, it must be admit-"
ted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher’s lot easier —” 
“DON’T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT!” Harry yelled. 
"He was on his feet again, furious,"
" ready to fly at Dumbledore, who "
had plainly not understood Sirius at 
"all, how brave he was, how much "
he had suffered . . . 
“What about Snape?” Ha
"rry spat. “You’re not talking about him, "
are you? When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me 
as usual —” 
"“Harry, you know that Professor Snape had no choice but to pre-"
tend not to take you seriously in 
"front of Dolores Umbridge,” said "
   833 "Dumbledore steadily, “but as I have explained, he informed the Order "
as soon as possible about what yo
u had said. It was he who deduced 
where you had gone when you did not 
return from the forest. It was 
he too who gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was 
attempting to force yo
u to tell of Sirius’s
 whereabouts. . . .” 
"Harry disregarded this; he felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape, "
it seemed to be easing his own sens
"e of dreadful guilt, and he wanted "
to hear Dumbledore
 agree with him. 
“Snape — Snape g-goaded Sirius 
about staying in the house — he 
made out Sirius 
was a coward —” 
“Sirius was much too old and clev
er to have allowed such feeble 
"taunts to hurt him,” said Dumbledore. "
“Snape stopped giving me Occl
umency lessons!” Harry snarled. 
“He threw me out 
of his office!” 
"“I am aware of it,” said Dumbledo"
re heavily. “I have already said 
"that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was "
"sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than "
to open your mind even further 
to Voldemort while in my 
presence —” 
"“Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with "
him —” Harry remembered Ron’s thoughts on the subject and 
plunged on. “How do you know he wasn
’t trying to soften me up for 
"Voldemort, make it easier fo"
r him to get inside my —” 
"“I trust Severus Snape,” said Dumbledore simply. “But I forgot — "
another old man’s mistake — that so
me wounds run too deep for the 
healing. I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about 
your father — I was wrong.” 
"“But that’s okay, is it?” yelled Ha"
"rry, ignoring the scandalized faces "
and disapproving mutterings of the po
rtraits covering the walls. “It’s 
"okay for Snape to hate my dad, but "
it’s not okay for Sirius to hate 
Kreacher?” 
"“Sirius did not hate Kreacher,” "
said Dumbledore. “He regarded 
 834 him as a servant unworthy of much
 interest or notice. Indifference 
and neglect often do much more dama
ge than outright dislike. . . . 
The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mis-
"treated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping "
our reward.” 
“SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT 
"HE GOT, DID HE?” Harry "
yelled. 
"“I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it,” Dumbledore "
replied quietly. “Sirius was not a crue
"l man, he was kind to house-elves "
in general. He had no love for Krea
"cher, because Kreacher was a living "
reminder of the home Sirius had hated.” 
"“Yeah, he did hate it!” said Har"
"ry, his voice cracking, turning his "
back on Dumbledore and walking away
. The sun was bright inside the 
"room now, and the eyes of all the po"
"rtraits followed him as he walked, "
without realizing what he
" was doing, without seeing"
 the office at all. 
“You made him stay shut up in that
" house and he hated it, that’s why "
he wanted to get out last night —” 
“I was trying to keep Sirius 
"alive,” said Dumbledore quietly. "
“People don’t like being locked up
"!” Harry said furiously, rounding "
on him. “You did it to 
me all last summer —” 
Dumbledore closed his eyes and buri
ed his face in his long-fingered 
"hands. Harry watched him, but this "
uncharacteristic sign of exhaus-
"tion, or sadness, or whatever it "
"was from Dumbledore, did not soften "
"him. On the contrary, he felt ev"
en angrier that Dumbledore was 
showing signs of weakness. He had no business being weak when 
Harry wanted to rage
 and storm at him. 
Dumbledore lowered his hands an
d surveyed Harry through his 
half-moon glasses. 
"“It is time,” he said, “for me to "
tell you what I shou
ld have told you 
"five years ago, Harry. Please sit do"
wn. I am going to tell you every-
thing. I ask only a little 
patience. You will have your chance to rage at  
   835 me — to do whatever you like — when 
I have finished. I will not stop 
you.” 
"Harry glared at him for a moment, "
then flung himself 
back into the 
chair opposite Dumbledore and waited. Dumbledore stared for a mo-
ment at the sunlit grounds outsid
"e the window, then looked back at "
"Harry and said, “Five years ago you "
"arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe "
"and whole, as I had planned and in"
tended. Well — not quite whole. 
You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and 
uncle’s doorstep. I knew I was condem
ning you to ten dark and diffi-
cult years.” 
He paused. Harry said nothing. 
“You might ask — and with good reason — why it had to be so. 
Why could some Wizarding family not have taken you in? Many 
would have done so more than glad
"ly, would have been honored and "
delighted to rais
e you as a son. 
“My answer is that my priority wa
s to keep you alive. You were in 
more danger than perhaps anyone 
but myself realized. Voldemort had 
"been vanquished hours before, but his supporters — and many of "
them are almost as terribl
e as he — were still at
" large, angry, desper-"
"ate, and violent. And I had to make my"
 decision too with regard to the 
years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone forever? No. I 
"knew not whether it would be ten, twenty, or fifty years before he re-"
"turned, but I was sure he would do "
"so, and I was sure too, knowing "
"him as I have done, that he woul"
d not rest until he killed you. 
“I knew that Voldemort’s knowledge of magic is perhaps more ex-
tensive than any wizard 
alive. I knew that even
 my most complex and 
powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if 
he ever returned to full power. 
“But I knew too where Voldemor
t was weak. And so I made my 
decision. You would be
 protected by an ancient magic of which 
"he knows, which he despises, and "
"which he has always, therefore,  "
 836 underestimated — to his cost. I am 
"speaking, of course, of the fact "
that your mother died to save you.
 She gave you a lingering protection 
"he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I "
"put my trust, therefore, in your mother’s blood. I delivered you to her "
"sister, her only re"
maining relative.” 
"“She doesn’t love me,” said Harry at once. “She doesn’t give a "
damn —” 
"“But she took you,” Dumbledore "
cut across him. “She may have 
"taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took "
"you, and in doing so, she sealed th"
e charm I placed upon you. Your 
mother’s sacrifice made the bond of
 blood the stronges
t shield I could 
give you.” 
“I still don’t —” 
“While you can still call home th
e place where your mother’s blood 
"dwells, there you cannot be touche"
d or harmed by Voldemort. He 
"shed her blood, but it lives on in"
 you and her sister. Her blood became 
your refuge. You need return there only
" once a year, but as long as you "
"can still call it home, there he cann"
ot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. 
I explained what I had done in the 
"letter I left, with you, on her "
doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept 
you alive for the pa
st fifteen years.” 
"“Wait,” said Harry."
 “Wait a moment.” 
He sat up straighter in his 
"chair, staring at Dumbledore. "
“You sent that Howler. You told 
her to remember 
— it was your 
voice —” 
"“I thought,” said Dumbledore, incl"
"ining his head slightly, “that she "
might need reminding of the pact she 
had sealed by taking you. I sus-
pected the dementor attack might 
have awoken her to the dangers of 
having you as a surrogate son.” 
"“It did,” said Harry quietly. “Well "
— my uncle more than her. He 
"wanted to chuck me out, but after "
the Howler came she — she said I  
   837 "had to stay.” He stared at the floor for a moment, then said, “But "
what’s this got to
 do with . . .” 
He could not say Sirius’s name. 
"“Five years ago, then,” continued "
"Dumbledore, as though he had "
"not paused in his story, “you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy "
nor as well nourished as I would ha
"ve liked, perhaps, yet alive and "
healthy. You were not a pampered litt
"le prince, but as normal a boy as "
I could have hoped under the circum
"stances. Thus far, my plan was "
working well. 
"“And then . . . well, you will rememb"
er the events of your first year 
at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I 
do. You rose magnificently to the 
"challenge that faced you, and soo"
ner — much sooner — than I had 
"anticipated, you found yourself face"
-to-face with Voldemort. You sur-
vived again. You did mo
re. You delayed his return to full power and 
strength. You fought a man’s fight. I was . . . prouder of you than I can 
say. 
“Yet there was a flaw in this wond
"erful plan of mine,” said Dumb-"
"ledore. “An obvious flaw that I knew, even then, might be the undo-"
"ing of it all. And yet, knowing ho"
w important it was that my plan 
"should succeed, I told myself that I "
would not permit this flaw to ruin 
"it. I alone could prevent this, so I "
alone must be strong. And here was 
"my first test, as you lay in the hosp"
"ital wing, weak from your struggle "
with Voldemort.” 
“I don’t understand
" what you’re saying,” said Harry. "
"“Don’t you remember asking me, as"
" you lay in the hospital wing, "
why Voldemort had tried to kill
 you when you were a baby?” 
Harry nodded. 
“Ought I to have told you then?” 
Harry stared into the blue eyes an
"d said nothing, but his heart was "
racing again. 
“You do not see the flaw in the plan 
"yet? No . . . perhaps not. Well,  "
 838 "as you know, I decided not to answer you. Eleven, I told myself, "
was much too young to know. I had 
never intended to tell you when 
you were eleven. The knowledge woul
d be too much at such a young 
age. 
“I should have recognized the da
nger signs then. I should have 
asked myself why I did not feel more
 disturbed that 
you had already 
asked me the question to which I knew
", one day, I must give a terrible "
answer. I should have recognized th
at I was too happy to think that I 
did not have to do it on that partic
"ular day. . . . You were too young, "
much too young. 
“And so we entered your second 
year at Hogwarts. And once again 
you met challenges even grown wiza
rds have never faced. Once again 
you acquitted yourself beyond my 
wildest dreams. You did not ask me 
"again, however, why Voldemort had le"
ft that mark up
on you. We dis-
"cussed your scar, oh yes. . . . We ca"
"me very, very close to the subject. "
Why did I not tell
 you everything? 
"“Well, it seemed to me that twelve was, after all, hardly better than "
eleven to receive such 
information. I allowed you to leave my pres-
"ence, bloodstained, exhausted but exhila"
"rated, and if I felt a twinge of "
"unease that I ought, perhaps, have"
" told you then, it was swiftly si-"
"lenced. You were still so young, you "
"see, and I could not find it in me "
to spoil that night 
of triumph. . . . 
"“Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now? "
I had fallen into the trap
" I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could "
"avoid, that I "
must avoid.” 
“I don’t —” 
"“I cared about you too much,” sa"
id Dumbledore simply. “I cared 
more for your happiness than your 
"knowing the truth, more for your "
"peace of mind than my plan, more "
for your life than the lives that 
might be lost if the plan failed. 
"In other words, I acted exactly as "
Voldemort expects we fools who love to act. 
“Is there a defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have — 
   839 and I have watched you more closel
y than you can have imagined — 
not to want to save you more pa
in than you had already suffered. 
What did I care if numbers of na
meless and faceless people and crea-
tures were slaughtered in the vague 
"future, if in the here and now you "
"were alive, and well, and happy? I "
never dreamed that I would have 
such a person on my hands. 
“We entered your third year. I watched from afar as you struggled 
"to repel dementors, as you found Si"
"rius, learned what he was and res-"
"cued him. Was I to tell you then, at the moment when you had tri-"
umphantly snatched your godfather 
from the jaws of the Ministry? 
"But now, at the age of thirteen, my"
 excuses were running out. Young 
"you might be, but you had proved "
you were exceptional. My con-
"science was uneasy, Harry."
 I knew the time mu
st come soon. . . . 
“But you came out of the maze la
"st year, having watched Cedric "
"Diggory die, having escaped death so"
 narrowly yourself . . . and I did 
"not tell you, though I knew, now Vo"
"ldemort had returned, I must do "
"it soon. And now, tonight, I know "
you have long been ready for the 
knowledge I have kept from you for 
"so long, because you have proved "
that I should have placed the burden upon you before this. My only 
defense is this: I have watched yo
u struggling under more burdens 
than any student who has ever passed
" through this school, and I could "
not bring myself to add anothe
r — the greatest one of all.” 
"Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak. "
“I still don’t understand.” 
“Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a 
prophecy made shortly before your birth. He knew the prophecy had 
"been made, though he did not know "
its full contents. He set out to 
"kill you when you were still a baby, believing he was fulfilling the "
terms of the prophecy. He discover
"ed, to his cost, that he was mis-"
"taken, when the curse in"
tended to kill you backfi
"red. And so, since his "
"return to his body, and particularly"
 since your extraordinary escape 
"from him last year, he has been dete"
rmined to hear that prophecy in 
 840 its entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously 
since his return: th
e knowledge of how to destroy you.” 
The sun had risen fully now. Dumble
dore’s office was bathed in it. 
The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided 
"gleamed white and opaque, the frag"
ments of the instruments Harry 
"had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the "
baby Fawkes made soft chirruping
 noises in his 
nest of ashes. 
"“The prophecy’s smashed,” Harry said blankly. “I was pulling "
"Neville up those benches in the — the room where the archway was, "
and I ripped his robes 
and it fell. . . .” 
“The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy 
kept by the Department of Mysterie
s. But the prophecy was made to 
"somebody, and that pers"
on has the means of re
calling it perfectly.” 
"“Who heard it?” asked Harry, thou"
gh he thought he knew the an-
swer already. 
"“I did,” said Dumbledore. “On a "
"cold, wet night sixteen years ago, "
in a room above the bar at the Hog’s Head Inn. I had gone there to see 
"an applicant for the post of Divination teacher, though it was against "
my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all. 
"The applicant, however, was the gr"
eat-great-granddaughter of a very 
"famous, very gifted Seer, and I thought it common politeness to meet "
her. I was disappointed. It seemed to
 me that she had not a trace of the 
"gift herself. I told her, courteously I hope, that I did not think she "
would be suitable for the post. I turned to leave.” 
Dumbledore got to his feet and walk
ed past Harry to
 the black cab-
inet that stood beside Fawkes’s pe
"rch. He bent down, slid back a "
"catch, and took from in"
side it the shallow sto
"ne basin, carved with "
"runes around the edges, in whic"
h Harry had seen his father torment-
ing Snape. Dumbledore walked back 
"to the desk, placed the Pensieve "
"upon it, and raised his wand to his"
" own temple. From it, he withdrew "
"silvery, gossamer-fine strands of "
"thought clinging to the wand, and "
deposited them in the basin. He 
sat back down behind his desk and 
   841 watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment. 
"Then, with a sigh, he raised his"
 wand and prodded the silvery sub-
stance with its tip. 
"A figure rose out of it, draped in shawls, her eyes magnified to enor-"
"mous size behind her glasses, and she revolved slowly, her feet in the "
basin. But when Sibyll Trelawney spok
"e, it was not in her usual ethe-"
"real, mystic voice, but in the hars"
"h, hoarse tones Harry had heard her "
use once before.

The slowly revolving Professor Trel
awney sank back 
into the silver 
mass below and vanished. 
The silence within the office was absolute. Neither Dumbledore 
nor Harry nor any of the portraits 
made a sound. Even Fawkes had 
fallen silent. 
“Professor Dumbledore?” Harry said
" very quietly, for Dumbledore, "
"still staring at the Pensieve, seemed co"
mpletely lost in thought. “It . . . 
did that mean . . . Wh
at did that mean?” 
"“It meant,” said Dumbledore, “that the person who has the only "
chance of conquering Lord Voldem
ort for good was born at the end 
"of July, nearly sixteen years ago. "
This boy would be born to parents 
who had already 
defied Voldemort three times.” 
Harry felt as though 
something was closing in upon him. His 
breathing seemed difficult again. 
“It means — me?” 
Dumbledore surveyed him for a 
moment through his glasses. 
 842 "“The odd thing is, Harry,” he said "
"softly, “that it may not have "
meant you at all. Sibyll’s prophecy could have applied to two wizard 
"boys, both born at the end of July"
" that year, both of whom had par-"
"ents in the Order of the Phoenix, bo"
th sets of parents having narrowly 
"escaped Voldemort three times. One, of course, was you. The other "
was Neville Longbottom.” 
"“But then . . . but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and "
not Neville’s?” 
“The official record was relabele
d after Voldemort’s attack on you 
"as a child,” said Dumbledore. “It s"
eemed plain to the keeper of the 
Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort coul
d only have tried to kill you be-
cause he knew you to be the one 
to whom Sibyll 
was referring.” 
“Then — it might not be
 me?” said Harry. 
"“I am afraid,” said Dumbledore "
"slowly, looking as though every "
"word cost him a great effort, “that there is no doubt that it "
is
 you.” 
“But you said — Nevill
e was born at the end of July too — and his 
mum and dad —” 
“You are forgetting the next part 
"of the prophecy, the final identi-"
fying feature of the boy who could 
vanquish Voldemort. . . . Volde-
mort himself would ‘mark him as his 
"equal.’ And so he did, Harry. He "
"chose you, not Neville. He gave yo"
u the scar that has proved both 
blessing and curse.” 
“But he might have chosen wrong!
” said Harry. “He might have 
marked the wrong person!” 
“He chose the boy he thought most 
"likely to be a danger to him,” "
"said Dumbledore. “And notice this, "
"Harry. He chose, not the pureblood "
"(which, according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being "
"or knowing), but th"
"e half-blood, like himself. "
He saw himself in you be-
fore he had ever seen yo
"u, and in marking you with"
" that scar, he did not "
"kill you, as he intended, but gave "
"you powers, and a future, which have "
"fitted you to escape him not once, "
but four times so far — something 
"that neither your parents, nor Ne"
"ville’s parents, ever achieved.” "
   843 "“Why did he do it, then?” said "
"Harry, who felt numb and cold. "
“Why did he try and kill me as a ba
by? He should have waited to see 
whether Neville or I looked more 
dangerous when we were older and 
tried to kill whoever it was then —” 
"“That might, indeed, have been th"
"e more practical course,” said "
"Dumbledore, “except that Voldemort’s information about the "
"prophecy was incomplete. The Hog’s Head Inn, which Sibyll chose "
"for its cheapness, has long attracted,"
" shall we say, a more interesting "
clientele than the Three Broomsticks
. As you and your friends found 
"out to your cost, and I to mine that n"
"ight, it is a place where it is never "
"safe to assume you are not being overheard. Of course, I had not "
"dreamed, when I set out to meet Si"
"byll Trelawney, that I would hear "
anything worth overhearing. My 
— our — one stro
ke of good for-
tune was that the eavesdropper was de
tected only a short way into the 
prophecy and thrown 
from the building.” 
“So he only heard . . . ?” 
"“He heard only the first part, the pa"
rt foretelling the birth of a boy 
in July to parents who had thrice 
"defied Voldemort. Consequently, he "
could not warn his master that to 
attack you would be to risk trans-
ferring power to you — again markin
g you as his equal. So Voldemort 
never knew that there might be danger
" in attacking you, that it might "
be wise to wait or to learn more
. He did not know that you would 
have ‘power the Dark Lord knows not’ —” 
“But I don’t!” said Harry in a strangled voice. “I haven’t any powers 
"he hasn’t got, I couldn’t fight th"
"e way he did tonight, I can’t possess "
people or — or 
kill them —” 
"“There is a room in the Department of Mysteries,” interrupted "
"Dumbledore, “that is kept locked at "
all times. It contains a force that 
is at once more wonderful and more
" terrible than death, than human "
"intelligence, than forces of nature. "
"It is also, perhaps, the most myste-"
rious of the many subjects for study that reside there. It is the power 
held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which 
 844 Voldemort has not at all. That power 
took you to save Sirius tonight. 
That power also saved you from po
"ssession by Voldemort, because he "
could not bear to reside in a body so 
full of the force he detests. In the 
"end, it mattered not that"
 you could not close yo
ur mind. It was your 
heart that saved you.” 
Harry closed his eyes. If he had 
"not gone to save Sirius, Sirius "
would not have died. . . . More to
 stave off the moment when he 
would have to think of Sirius ag
"ain, Harry asked, without caring "
"much about the answer, “The end of the prophecy . . . it was some-"
thing about . . . ‘
neither can live.
 . . .’” 
“‘. . .
" while the other survives,"
’”
said Dumbledore. 
"“So,” said Harry, dredging up the wo"
rds from what felt like a deep 
"well of despair inside him, “so does that"
 mean that . . . that one of us 
has got to kill the othe
r one . . . in the end?” 
"“Yes,” said Dumbledore. "
"For a long time, neither of them spoke. Somewhere far beyond the "
"office walls, Harry could hear the so"
"und of voices, students heading "
down to the Great Hall for an early 
"breakfast, perhaps. It seemed im-"
possible that there could be people 
in the world who st
"ill desired food, "
"who laughed, who neither knew nor "
cared that Sirius Black was gone 
forever. Sirius seemed a million mile
"s away already, even if a part of "
Harry still believed that if he had on
"ly pulled back that veil, he would "
have found Sirius lookin
"g back at him, greeting"
" him, perhaps, with "
his laugh like a bark. . . . 
“I feel I owe you another explan
"ation, Harry,” said Dumbledore "
"hesitantly. “You may, perhaps, ha"
ve wondered why I never chose you 
as a prefect? I must confess . . . th
at I rather thought . . . you had 
enough responsibility to be going on with.” 
Harry looked up at him and saw 
a tear trickling down Dumble-
dore’s face into his 
long silver beard. 
In a brief statement Friday 
"night, Minister of Magic "
Cornelius Fudge confirmed that He-Who-Must-
Not-Be Named has returned to this country and is 
active once more. 
“It is with great regret that I must confirm that the 
"wizard styling himself Lord — well, you know who I "
"mean — is alive and among us again,” said Fudge, "
looking tired and flustered as
 he addressed reporters. 
“It is with almost equal regr
et that we report the mass 
revolt of the dementors of
" Azkaban, who have shown "
themselves averse to contin
uing in the Ministry’s em-
ploy. We believe that the dementors are currently tak-
ing direction from Lord — Thingy. 
“We urge the magical population to remain vigi-
lant. The Ministry is currently publishing guides to 
elementary home and person
al defense that will be 
 846 delivered free to all Wizarding homes within the 
coming month.” 
The Minister’s statement was met with dismay and 
"alarm from the Wizarding community, which as re-"
cently as last Wednesday 
was receiving Ministry as-
surances that there was “no 
truth whatsoever in these 
persistent rumors that You-Know-Who is operating 
amongst us once more.” 
Details of the events that led to the Ministry turn-
"around are still hazy, though"
 it is believed that He-
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named an
d a select band of 
followers (known as Death Eaters) gained entry to 
the Ministry of Magic itself on Thursday evening. 
"Albus Dumbledore, newly "
reinstated headmaster 
of Hogwarts School of Wi
"tchcraft and Wizardry, re-"
instated member of the International Confederation 
"of Wizards, and reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wiz-"
"engamot, was unavailable for "
comment last night. He 
has insisted for a year th
at You-Know-Who was not 
"dead, as was widely hoped and believed, but recruit-"
ing followers once more for a fresh attempt to seize 
power. Meanwhile the Boy Who Lived — 
"“There you are, Harry, I knew they’d drag you into it somehow,” "
"said Hermione, looking over th"
e top of the paper at him. 
They were in the hospital wing
. Harry was sitting on the end of 
Ron’s bed and they were both list
ening to Hermione read the front 
page of the 
Sunday Prophet.
" Ginny, whose ankle "
had been mended in 
"a trice by Madam Pomfrey, was curled"
 up at the foot of Hermione’s 
"bed; Neville, whose nose had likewise"
 been returned to its normal size 
"and shape, was in a chair between the two beds; and Luna, who had "
dropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of 
"The Quibbler,"
 was 
   847 reading the magazine upside down 
and apparently no
t taking in a 
word Hermione was saying. 
“He’s ‘the Boy Who Lived’ again no
"w, though, isn’t he?” said Ron "
"darkly. “Not such a show-off maniac anymore, eh?” "
He helped himself to a handful of Chocolate Frogs from the im-
"mense pile on his bedside cabinet,"
" threw a few to Harry, Ginny, and "
"Neville, and ripped off the wrapper of"
 his own with his teeth. There 
were still deep welts on his forear
ms where the brain’s tentacles had 
"wrapped around him. According to Madam Pomfrey, thoughts could "
leave deeper scarring than almost 
"anything else, though since she had "
started applying copious amounts of Dr. Ubbly’s Oblivious Unc-
"tion, there seemed to "
be some improvement. 
"“Yes, they’re very complimentary "
"about you now, Harry,” said "
"Hermione, now scanning down the article. “‘"
A lone voice of truth
 . . .
"perceived as unbalanced, yet never wavered in his story "
. . .
 forced to bear 
ridicule and slander
" . . .’ Hmmm,” said Hermione, frowning, “I notice "
they don’t mention the fact that it
 was them doing all the ridiculing 
"and slandering, though. . . .” "
She winced slightly and put a hand
 to her ribs. The curse Dolohov 
"had used on her, though less effectiv"
e than it would 
have been had he 
been able to say the 
"incantation aloud, had "
"nevertheless caused, in "
"Madam Pomfrey’s words, “quite enough damage to be going on with.” "
Hermione was having to take ten 
different types of potion every day 
"and although she was improving greatly, was already bored with the "
hospital wing.

. . .’
"Well,” said Hermione, fo"
lding up the newspaper 
"and throwing it aside, “it’s certainl"
y given them lots to write about. 
And that interview with Harry isn’t ex
"clusive, it’s the one that was in "
The Quibbler
 months ago. . . .” 
 848 "“Daddy sold it to them,” said Luna vaguely, turning a page of "
The 
Quibbler.
" “He got a very good price for it too, so we’re going to go on "
an expedition to Sweden this summer and see if we can catch a 
Crumple-Horned Snorkack.” 
Hermione seemed to struggle with
" herself for a moment, then said, "
“That sounds lovely.” 
Ginny caught Harry’s eye and lo
"oked away quickly, grinning. "
"“So anyway,” said Hermione, sitting "
up a little straighter and winc-
"ing again, “what’s go"
ing on in school?” 
"“Well, Flitwick’s got rid of Fred and George’s swamp,” said Ginny. "
“He did it in about three seconds. 
But he left a tiny patch under the 
window and he’s roped it off —” 
“Why?” said Hermione
", looking startled. "
"“Oh, he just says it was a real"
"ly good bit of magic,” said Ginny, "
shrugging. 
“I think he left it as a monument
" to Fred and George,” said Ron "
through a mouthful of chocolate. “T
"hey sent me all these, you know,” "
"he told Harry, pointing at the smal"
l mountain of Frogs beside him. 
"“Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?” "
Hermione looked rather disappro
"ving and asked, “So has all the "
trouble stopped now 
Dumbledore’s back?” 
"“Yes,” said Neville, “everything’s settled right back down again.” "
"“I s’pose Filch is happy, is he?”"
" asked Ron, propping a Chocolate "
Frog card featuring Dumble
dore against hi
s water jug. 
"“Not at all,” said Ginny. “He’s really, really miserable, actually. . . .” "
She lowered her voice to a whisper.
 “He keeps saying Umbridge was 
the best thing that
 ever happened to Hogwarts. . . .” 
All six of them looked around. Pr
ofessor Umbridge was lying in a 
"bed opposite them, gazing up at "
the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode 
alone into the forest to rescue 
her from the centaurs. How he had 
done it — how he had emerged from
 the trees supporting Professor 
Umbridge without so much as a sc
ratch on him — no
"body knew, and "
   849 Umbridge was certainly no
t telling. Since she had returned to the cas-
"tle she had not, as far as any of th"
"em knew, uttered a single word. No-"
body really knew what was wrong 
with her either. Her usually neat 
mousy hair was very untidy and there we
"re bits of twig and leaf in it, "
but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed. 
"“Madam Pomfrey says she’s just in shock,” whispered Hermione. "
"“Sulking, more like,” said Ginny "
"“Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,” said Ron, and with his "
"tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises. Umbridge sat bolt upright, "
looking wildly around. 
"“Anything wrong, Professor?” call"
"ed Madam Pomfrey, poking her "
head around her office door. 
“No . . . no . . .” said Umbridge
", sinking back into her pillows, "
"“no, I must have be"
en dreaming. . . .” 
Hermione and Ginny muffled thei
r laughter in the bedclothes. 
"“Speaking of centaurs,” said He"
"rmione, when she had recovered a "
"little, “who’s Divination teacher now? Is Firenze staying?” "
"“He’s got to,” said Harry, “the ot"
"her centaurs won’t take him back, "
will they?” 
"“It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach,” said "
Ginny. 
“Bet Dumbledore wishes he could’ve got rid of Trelawney for 
"good,” said Ron, now munching on "
"his fourteenth Frog. “Mind you, "
the whole subjects useless if you ask 
"me, Firenze isn’t a lot better. . . .” "
“How can you say that?” Hermio
ne demanded. “After we’ve just 
found out that there are real prophecies?” 
Harry’s heart began to race. He ha
"d not told Ron, Hermione, or "
anyone else what the prophecy had 
contained. Neville had told them 
it had smashed while Harry was pullin
g him up the steps in the Death 
"Room, and Harry had not yet correcte"
d this impression. He was not 
ready to see their expressions when he
 told them that he must be ei-
"ther murderer or victim, th"
ere was no other way. . . . 
 850 "“It is a pity it broke,” said He"
"rmione quietly, shaking her head. "
"“Yeah, it is,” said Ron. “Still, "
at least You-Know-Who never found 
out what was in it either — where 
"are you going?” he added, looking "
both surprised and disappoi
nted as Harry stood up. 
"“Er — Hagrid’s,” said Harry. “You know, he just got back and I "
promised I’d go down and see him and tell him how you two are. . . .” 
"“Oh all right then,” said Ron grum"
"pily, looking out of the dormi-"
tory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond. “Wish we could 
come . . .” 
“Say hello to him fo
r us!” called Hermio
"ne, as Harry proceeded "
down the ward. “And ask him what’s happening about . . . about his 
little friend!” 
Harry gave a wave of his hand to
 show he had heard and under-
stood as he left 
the dormitory. 
The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday. Everybody was 
"clearly out in the sunny grounds, "
enjoying the end of their exams and 
the prospect of a last 
few days of term unhampered by studying or 
homework. Harry walked slowly alon
"g the deserted corridor, peering "
out of windows as he went. He co
uld see people messing around in 
the air over the Quidditch pitch an
d a couple of students swimming 
"in the lake, accompanied by the giant squid. "
He was finding it hard 
at the moment to decide whether he wanted 
to be with people or not. Wheneve
r he was in company he wanted to 
"get away, and whenever he was alone he wanted company. He thought "
he might really go and visit Hagrid
", though; he had not talked to him "
properly since he 
had returned. . . . 
Harry had just descended 
the last marble step 
into the entrance hall 
"when Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle em"
erged from a door on the right 
that Harry knew led down to th
e Slytherin common room. Harry 
stopped dead; so did Malfoy and th
"e others. For a few moments, the "
"only sounds were the shouts, laughter, and splashes drifting into the "
hall from the grounds thro
ugh the open front doors. 
   851 Malfoy glanced around. Harry knew 
he was checking for signs of 
teachers. Then he looked back at
" Harry and said in a low voice, "
"“You’re dead, Potter.” "
"Harry raised his eyebrows. “Funny,” he said, “you’d think I’d have "
stopped walking around. . . .” 
Malfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him. He felt a kind 
of detached satisfaction 
at the sight of his pale
", pointed face contorted "
with rage. 
"“You’re going to pay,” said Malfoy in a voice barely louder than a "
whisper. “
I’m
 going to make you pay fo
r what you’ve done to my 
father. . . .” 
"“Well, I’m terrified now,” said Ha"
rry sarcastically. “I s’pose Lord 
Voldemort’s just a warm-up act comp
ared to you three — what’s the 
"matter?” he said, for Malfoy, Cr"
"abbe, and Goyle had all looked "
stricken at the sound of the name. “H
"e’s your dad’s mate, isn’t he? Not "
"scared of him, are you?” "
"“You think you’re such a big man,"
" Potter,” said Malfoy, advancing "
"now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him"
. “You wait. I’ll have you. You 
can’t land my father in prison —” 
“I thought I just 
"had,” said Harry. "
"“The dementors have left Azkaban,"
” said Malfoy quietly. “Dad and 
the others’ll be out 
in no time. . . .” 
"“Yeah, I expect they will,” said "
"Harry. “Still, at "
least everyone 
knows what scumbags
 they are now —” 
Malfoy’s hand flew toward his 
"wand, but Harry was too quick for "
him. He had drawn his own wand b
efore Malfoy’s fingers had even 
entered the pocket
 of his robes. 
“Potter!” 
The voice rang across the entrance hall; Snape had emerged from the 
"staircase leading down to his office, and at the sight of him Harry felt a "
great rush of hatred beyond anything
 he felt toward Malfoy. . . . What-
"ever Dumbledore said, he would neve"
r forgive Snape . 
. . never . . . 
 852 "“What are you doing, Potter?” said "
"Snape coldly as ever, as he "
strode over to the four of them. 
“I’m trying to decide what curse 
"to use on Malfoy, sir,” said Harry "
fiercely. 
Snape stared at him. 
"“Put that wand away at once,” "
he said curtly. “Ten points from 
Gryff —” 
Snape looked toward the giant hour
glasses on the walls and gave a 
sneering smile. 
“Ah. I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hour-
"glass to take away. In that case, "
"Potter, we will simp"
ly have to —” 
“Add some more?” 
Professor McGonagall had just stum
ped up the stone steps into the 
castle. She was carrying 
a tartan carpetbag in 
one hand and leaning 
heavily on a walking stick with her 
"other, but otherwise looked quite "
well. 
"“Professor McGonagall!” said Snape,"
 striding forward. “Out of St. 
"Mungo’s, I see!” "
"“Yes, Professor Snape,” said Professor McGonagall, shrugging off "
"her traveling cloak, “I’m quite as"
 good as new. You two — Crabbe — 
Goyle —” 
"She beckoned them forward imperiously and they came, shuffling "
their large feet and looking awkward. 
"“Here,” said Professor McGonagall,"
 thrusting her carpetbag into 
Crabbe’s chest and her cloak into Goyl
"e’s, “take these up to my office "
for me.” 
They turned and stumped away
 up the marble staircase. 
"“Right then,” said Professor McGo"
"nagall, looking up at the hour-"
"glasses on the wall, “well, I think "
Potter and his friends ought to have 
fifty points apiece for alerting th
e world to the return of You-Know-
"Who! What say you,"
 Professor Snape?” 
   853 "“What?” snapped Snape, though"
 Harry knew he had heard per-
fectly well. “Oh — well
 — I suppose . . .” 
"“So that’s fifty each for Potter, "
"the two Weasleys, Longbottom, and "
"Miss Granger,” said Professor McGonagall, and a shower of rubies fell "
down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor’s hourglass as she spoke. 
"“Oh — and fifty for Miss Lovegood,"
" I suppose,” she added, and a "
"number of sapphires fell into Ravenclaw’s glass. “Now, you wanted to "
"take ten from Mr. Potter, I think,"
 Professor Snape — so there we 
are. . . .” 
A few rubies retreated into the 
"upper bulb, leaving a respectable "
amount below nevertheless. 
"“Well, Potter, Malfoy, I think you ou"
ght to be outside on a glorious 
"day like this,” Professor Mc"
Gonagall continued briskly. 
Harry did not need telling 
twice. He thrust his wand back inside 
his robes and headed straight fo
r the front doors without another 
glance at Snap
e and Malfoy. 
The hot sun hit him with a blast 
as he walked across the lawns 
toward Hagrid’s cabin. Students 
lying around on the grass sun-
"bathing, talking, reading the "
"Sunday Prophet,"
 and eating sweets 
"looked up at him as he passed. Some called out to him, or else "
"waved, clearly eager to sh"
"ow that they, like the "
"Prophet,"
 had decided 
he was something of a hero. Harry 
said nothing to any of them. He 
had no idea how much they knew 
of what had happened three days 
"ago, but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred it "
that way. 
He thought at first when he knoc
ked on Hagrid’s cabin door that 
"he was out, but then Fang came ch"
arging around the corner and al-
most bowled him over wi
"th the enthusiasm of his welcome. Hagrid, it "
"transpired, was picking runner"
 beans in his back garden. 
"“All righ’, Harry!” he said, beam"
"ing, when Harry approached the "
"fence. “Come in, come in, we’ll have"
 a cup o’ dandel
ion juice. . . . 
 854 “How’s things?” Hagrid asked hi
"m, as they settled down at his "
wooden table with a glass apiece of ic
ed juice. “You — er — feelin’ all 
"righ’, are yeh?” "
Harry knew from the look of concer
n on Hagrid’s face that he was 
not referring to Harry’
s physical well-being. 
"“I’m fine,” Harry said quickly, beca"
use he could not bear to discuss 
"the thing that he knew was in Hagrid’s mind. “So, where’ve you "
been?” 
"“Bin hidin’ out in the mountains,” said Hagrid. “Up in a cave, like "
Sirius did when he —” 
"Hagrid broke off, cleared his thro"
"at gruffly, looked at Harry, and "
took a long draft of juice. 
"“Anyway, back now,” he said feebly. "
"“You — you look better,” said Ha"
"rry, who was determined to keep "
the conversation moving away from Sirius. 
"“Wha?” said Hagrid, raising a ma"
ssive hand and feeling his face. 
"“Oh — oh yeah. Well, Grawpy’s lo"
"ads better behaved now, loads. "
"Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back, ter tell yeh the truth. "
"He’s a good lad, really. . . . I’ve bin "
thinkin’ abou’ tryin’ ter find him a 
"lady friend, ac"
tually. . . .” 
Harry would normally have tried to
 persuade Hagrid out of this 
idea at once. The prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the 
"forest, possibly even wilder and more"
" brutal than Grawp, was posi-"
"tively alarming, but somehow Har"
ry could not muster the energy nec-
"essary to argue the point. He was starting to wish he was alone again, "
and with the idea of 
hastening his departure 
he took several large 
"gulps of his dandelion juice,"
 half emptying his glass. 
“Ev’ryone knows you’ve 
bin tellin’ the truth 
"now, Harry,” said Ha-"
grid softly and unexpectedly. “Tha
’s gotta be bette
"r, hasn’ it?” "
Harry shrugged. 
“Look . . .” Hagrid leaned toward 
"him across the table, “I knew  "
   855 Sirius longer ’n you did. . . . He di
"ed in battle, an’ tha’s the way he’d’ve "
wanted ter go —” 
“He didn’t want to go at 
all!” said Harry angrily. 
Hagrid bowed his great shaggy head. 
"“Nah, I don’ reckon he did,” he said "
"quietly. “But still, Harry . . . he "
was never one ter sit around at home 
an’ let other people do the fightin’. 
He couldn’ have lived 
with himself if he ha
dn’ gone ter help —” 
Harry leapt up again. 
“I’ve got to go and visit Ron and 
"Hermione in the hospital wing,” "
he said mechanically. 
"“Oh,” said Hagrid, looking rather upset. “Oh . . . all righ then, "
"Harry . . . Take care of yerself then, "
an’ drop back in if yeh’ve got a 
mo. . . .” 
“Yeah . . . right . . .” 
Harry crossed to the door as fast as
 he could and pulled it open. He 
was out in the sunshine again before
 Hagrid had finished saying good-
bye and walked away acro
ss the lawn. Once agai
"n, people called out "
"to him as he passed. He closed his eyes for a few moments, wishing "
"they would all vanish, that he could open his eyes and find himself "
alone in the grounds. . . . 
"A few days ago, before his exams "
had finished and he had seen the 
vision Voldemort had planted in his
" mind, he would have given al-"
most anything for the Wizarding wo
rld to know that he had been 
"telling the truth, for them to be"
lieve that Voldemort was back and 
know that he was neither a liar
" nor mad. Now, however . . . "
He walked a short way around the 
"lake, sat down on its bank, shel-"
tered from the gaze of passersby be
"hind a tangle of shrubs, and stared "
out over the gleaming 
"water, thinking. . . . "
Perhaps the reason he wanted to 
be alone was because he had felt 
isolated from everybody since his ta
lk with Dumbledore. An invisible 
barrier separated him from the rest 
of the world. He was — he had  
 856 always been — a marked man. It was 
just that he had never really un-
derstood what that
 meant. . . . 
And yet sitting here on the edge of
" the lake, with the terrible weight "
"of grief dragging at him, with the loss of Sirius so raw and fresh inside, "
he could not muster any great sense of fear. It was sunny and the 
grounds around him were full of la
"ughing people, and even though he "
felt as distant from them as though 
"he belonged to a different race, it "
was still very hard to believe as he 
"sat here that his life must include, "
"or end in, murder. . . . "
"He sat there for a long time, gazing"
" out at the water, trying not to "
think about his godfather or to reme
mber that it was directly across 
"from here, on the opposite bank, th"
at Sirius had coll
apsed trying to 
fend off a hundred dementors. . . . 
The sun had fallen before he realiz
ed that he was cold. He got up 
"and returned to the castle, wiping hi"
s face on his sleeve as he went. 
Ron and Hermione left the hospital 
wing completely cured three days 
before the end of term. Hermione sh
owed signs of wanting to talk 
"about Sirius, but Ron tended to ma"
ke hushing noises every time she 
mentioned his name. Harry was not sure
 whether or not he wanted to 
talk about his godfather yet; his 
wishes varied with his mood. He 
"knew one thing, though: Unhappy as"
" he felt at the moment, he would "
greatly miss Hogwarts in a few days
’ time when he was back at num-
"ber four, Privet Drive. Even thou"
gh he now understood exactly why 
"he had to return there every summer,"
 he did not feel any better about 
"it. Indeed, he had never "
dreaded his return more. 
Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term. 
It seemed that she had crept out of
 the hospital wing during dinner-
"time, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortunately for "
"her, she met Peeves on the way, wh"
o seized his last chance to do as 
"Fred had instructed and chased her gleefully from the premises,  "
   857 whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk. 
Many students ran out into the entrance hall to watch her running 
"away down the path, and the Heads "
of Houses tried 
only halfheart-
edly to restrain their pupils. Ind
"eed, Professor McGonagall sank back "
into her chair at the staff table 
after a few feeble remonstrances and 
was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering af-
"ter Umbridge herself, "
because Peeves had borro
wed her walking stick. 
Their last evening at school arrive
d; most people ha
d finished pack-
ing and were already heading down
" to the end-of-term feast, but "
Harry had not even started. 
"“Just do it tomorrow!” said Ron, "
who was waiting by the door of 
"their dormitory. “Come on, I’m starving. . . .” "
“I won’t be long. . . . L
"ook, you go ahead. . . .” "
"But when the dormitory door closed behind Ron, Harry made no ef-"
fort to speed up his packing. The ve
ry last thing he wanted to do was to 
attend the end-of-term feast. He 
was worried that Dumbledore would 
make some reference to 
him in his speech. He was sure to mention 
Voldemort’s return; he had 
talked to them about it la
"st year, after all. . . . "
Harry pulled some crumpled robes 
out of the very bottom of his 
trunk to make way for folded ones 
"and, as he did so, noticed a badly "
wrapped package lying in a corner of
 it. He could not think what it 
"was doing there. He bent down, pu"
lled it out from underneath his 
"trainers, and examined it. "
He realized what it was within se
conds. Sirius had given it to him 
just inside the front door of twelve Grimmauld Place. 
Use it if you need 
"me, all right"
? 
Harry sank down onto his bed an
d unwrapped the package. Out 
"fell a small, square mirror. It looked"
 old; it was cert
ainly dirty. Harry 
held it up to his face
 and saw his own reflecti
on looking back at him. 
He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled 
note from Sirius. 
 858 This is a two-way mirror. I’ve got the other. 
"If you need to speak to me, just say my name "
into it; you’ll appear in my mirror and I’ll be 
able to talk in yours. James and I used to use 
them when we were in separate detentions. 
And Harry’s heart began to race. He
 remembered seeing his dead 
parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able 
"to talk to Sirius again, right now, he knew it — "
He looked around to make sure 
there was nobody else there; the 
dormitory was quite empty. 
He looked back at the 
"mirror, raised it in "
front of his face with trembling ha
"nds, and said, loudly and clearly, "
“Sirius.” 
His breath misted the surface of th
e glass. He held the mirror even 
"closer, excitement flooding through him"
", but the eyes blinking back at "
him through the fog were
 definitely his own. 
He wiped the mirror clear again and 
"said, so that every syllable rang "
"clearly through the room, “Sirius Black!” "
Nothing happened. The frustrated 
face looking back out of the 
"mirror was still, defini"
"tely, his own. . . . "
Sirius didn’t have his mirror on him when he went through the arch-
"way,"
 said a small voice in Harry’s head. 
That’s why it’s not working.
 . . . 
"Harry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled the mirror "
"back into the trunk where it shattered. He had been convinced, for a "
"whole, shining minute, that he was going to see Sirius, talk to him "
again. . . . 
Disappointment was burning in his throat. He got up and began 
throwing his things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken 
mirror — 
But then an idea struck 
him. . . . A better idea 
than a mirror . . . A  
   859 "much bigger, more important idea "
. . . How had he never thought of 
it before — why had he never asked? 
He was sprinting out of the dor
mitory and down the spiral stair-
"case, hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing. He hurtled across "
"the empty common room, through the "
portrait hole and off along the 
"corridor, ignoring the Fat Lady, who "
"called after him, “The feast is "
"about to start, you know, you’re cutting it very fine!” "
But Harry had no intention of
 going to the feast . . . 
How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you 
"didn’t need one, yet now . . . "
He ran down staircases and along 
corridors and met nobody either 
"alive or dead. They were all, clea"
"rly, in the Great Hall. Outside his "
Charms classroom he came to a ha
"lt, panting and thinking disconso-"
lately that he would have to wait un
"til later, until after the end of the "
feast . . . 
But just as he had given up hope
 he saw it — a translucent some-
body drifting across the end of the corridor. 
“Hey — hey Nick! NICK!” 
"The ghost stuck its head back out of the wall, revealing the extrav-"
agantly plumed hat and dangerously wo
bbling head of Sir Nicholas de 
Mimsy-Porpington. 
"“Good evening,” he said, withdrawing "
the rest of his body from the 
solid stone and smiling at Harry. “I 
am not the only 
"one who is late, "
"then? Though,” he sighed, “in rather"
" different senses, of course . . .” "
"“Nick, can I ask you something?” "
A most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nick’s face as 
he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff
 at his neck and tugged it a little 
"straighter, apparently to give himsel"
f thinking time. He desisted only 
when his partially severe
d neck seemed about to give way completely. 
"“Er — now, Harry?” said Nick, l"
ooking discomforted. “Can’t it 
wait until after the feast?” 
 860 "“No — Nick — please,” said Harry, "
“I really need to talk to you. 
Can we go in here?” 
Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Head-
less Nick sighed. 
"“Oh very well,” he said, looking resigned. “I can’t pretend I haven’t "
been expecting it.” 
"Harry was holding the door open for him, but he drifted through "
the wall instead. 
“Expecting what?” Harry aske
"d, as he closed the door. "
"“You to come and find me,” said "
"Nick, now gliding over to the win-"
dow and looking out at
" the darkening grounds. “It happens, some-"
times . . . when somebody 
has suffered a . . . loss.” 
"“Well,” said Harry, refusing to be"
" deflected. “You were right, "
I’ve — I’ve come to find you.” 
Nick said nothing. 
"“It’s —” said Harry, who was findin"
g this more awkward than he had 
"anticipated, “it’s just — you’re dead. But you’re still here, aren’t you?” "
Nick sighed and co
ntinued to gaze out at the grounds. 
"“That’s right, isn’t it?” Harry urge"
"d him. “You died, but I’m talking "
to you. . . . You can walk around 
"Hogwarts and everything, can’t you?” "
"“Yes,” said Nearly Headless Nick quietly, “I walk and talk, yes.” "
"“So, you came back, didn’t you?” "
said Harry urgently. “People can 
"come back, right? As ghosts. They "
don’t have to disappear completely. 
Well
"?” he added impatiently, when Nick continued to say nothing. "
"Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, "
"then said, “Not everyone can come "
back as a ghost.” 
“What d’you mean?” sa
id Harry quickly. 
“Only . . . only wizards.” 
"“Oh,” said Harry, and he almost la"
"ughed with relief. “Well, that’s "
"okay then, the person I’m asking ab"
out is a wizard. So he can come 
"back, right?” "
   861 Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at 
Harry. “He won’t come back.” 
“Who?” 
"“Sirius Black,” said Nick. "
“But you did!” said Harry angrily. 
“You came back — you’re dead 
and you didn’t 
disappear —” 
“Wizards can leave an imprint of 
"themselves upon the earth, to "
walk palely where their living selves
" once trod,” said "
Nick miserably. 
“But very few wizard
s choose that path.” 
“Why not?” said Harry. “Anyway 
— it doesn’t matter — Sirius 
"won’t care if it’s unusual, he’ll come back, I know he will!” "
And so strong was his belief that 
Harry actually turned his head to 
"check the door, sure, for a split second, that he was going to see Sirius, "
pearly white and transparent but be
"aming, walking through it toward "
him. 
"“He will not come back,” repeated Ni"
ck quietly. “He will have . . . 
gone on.” 
"“What d’you mean, ‘gone on’?” sa"
id Harry quickly. “Gone on 
where? Listen — what happens wh
"en you die, anyway? Where do you "
go? Why doesn’t everyone come back? Why isn’t this place full of 
ghosts? Why — ?” 
"“I cannot answer,” said Nick. "
"“You’re dead, aren’t you?” said Ha"
rry exasperatedly. “Who can an-
swer better than you?” 
"“I was afraid of death,” said Ni"
ck. “I chose to remain behind. I 
sometimes wonder whether I oughtn’t to
" have . . . Well, that is neither "
"here nor there. . . . In fact, "
I
 am neither here nor th
ere. . . .” He gave 
"a small sad chuckle. “I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry, for "
I chose my feeble imitation of life 
instead. I believe learned wizards 
study the matter in the De
partment of Mysteries —” 
“Don’t talk to me about that 
place!” said Harry fiercely. 
 862 "“I am sorry not to have been more help,” said Nick gently. “Well "
". . . well, do excuse me . . "
". the feast, you know . . .” "
"And he left the room, leaving Har"
"ry there alone, gazing blankly at "
the wall through which 
Nick had di
sappeared. 
Harry felt almost as though he had 
lost his godfather all over again 
in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once 
more. He walked slowly and mise
rably back up through the empty 
"castle, wondering whether he woul"
d ever feel cheerful again. 
He had turned the corner toward
 the Fat Lady’s corridor when he 
saw somebody up ahead fastening a no
te to a board on the wall. A sec-
ond glance showed him that it was Luna. There were no good hiding 
"places nearby, she was bound to have"
" heard his footsteps, and in any "
"case, Harry could hardly muster th"
e energy to avoid anyone at the 
moment. 
"“Hello,” said Luna vaguely, glanci"
ng around at him as she stepped 
back from the notice. 
“How come you’re
 not at the feas
t?” Harry asked. 
"“Well, I’ve lost most "
"of my possessions,” said"
 Luna serenely. “Peo-
"ple take them and hide them, you know"
". But as it’s the last night, I re-"
"ally do need them back, so I’"
ve been putting up signs.” 
"She gestured toward the notice board, upon which, sure enough, "
she had pinned a list of all her miss
ing books and clothe
"s, with a plea "
for their return. 
An odd feeling rose in 
Harry — an emotion qu
ite different from 
the anger and grief that had filled him
 since Sirius’s death. It was a few 
moments before he realized that
 he was feeling sorry for Luna. 
“How come people hi
de your stuff?” he 
"asked her, frowning. "
“Oh . . . well . . .” She shrugged. 
"“I think they think I’m a bit odd, "
you know. Some people call me
 ‘Loony’ Loveg
"ood, actually.” "
Harry looked at her and the new fee
ling of pity intensified rather 
painfully. 
   863 “That’s no reason for them to take
" your things,” he said flatly. "
“D’you want help finding them?” 
"“Oh no,” she said, smiling at him. “They’ll come back, they always "
do in the end. It was just that I wanted to pack tonight. Anyway . . . 
why aren’t 
you
 at the feast?” 
Harry shrugged. “Just di
dn’t feel like it.” 
"“No,” said Luna, observing him wi"
"th those oddly misty, protuber-"
ant eyes. “I don’t suppose you do. 
That man the Death Eaters killed 
"was your godfather, wasn"
’t he? Ginny told me.” 
"Harry nodded curtly, but found that"
 for some reason he did not 
mind Luna talking about Sirius. He 
had just remembered that she too 
could see thestrals. 
“Have you . . .” he began. “I me
"an, who . . . has anyone you’ve "
known ever died?” 
"“Yes,” said Luna simply, “my mother. She was a quite extraordinary "
"witch, you know, but she did like to"
 experiment and one of her spells 
went rather badly wrong one day. I was nine.” 
"“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled. "
"“Yes, it was rather horrible,” said "
Luna conversationally. “I still feel 
"very sad about it sometimes. But I’ve still got Dad. And anyway, it’s "
not as though I’ll never 
"see Mum again, is it?” "
“Er — isn’t it?” said
 Harry uncertainly. 
She shook her head in disbelief.
" “Oh, come on. You heard them, "
"just behind the veil, didn’t you?” "
“You mean . . .” 
“In that room with the archway. They were just lurking out of 
"sight, that’s all."
 You heard them.” 
They looked at each other. Luna 
was smiling slightly. Harry did not 
"know what to say, or to think. Luna believed so many extraordinary "
things . . . yet he had been sure he
 had heard voices behind the veil 
too. . . . 
 864 “Are you sure you don’t want me to
 help you look for your stuff?” 
he said. 
"“Oh no,” said Luna. “No, I think I’ll just go down and have some "
pudding and wait for it al
l to turn up. . . . It always does in the end. 
". . . Well, have a ni"
"ce holiday, Harry.” "
"“Yeah . . . yeah, you too.” "
"She walked away from him, and as he watched her go, he found that "
the terrible weight in his stomach 
seemed to have lessened slightly. 
The journey home on th
e Hogwarts Express next day was eventful in 
"several ways. Firstly, Malfoy, Crabbe,"
" and Goyle, who had clearly been "
waiting all week for the opportunit
y to strike without teacher wit-
"nesses, attempted to ambush Har"
ry halfway down the train as he 
made his way back from the toilet
. The attack might have succeeded 
had it not been for the fact that they
 unwittingly chose to stage the at-
"tack right outside a compartment full of D.A. members, who saw "
what was happening through the gla
ss and rose as one to rush to 
Harry’s aid. By the time Ernie Ma
"cmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan "
"Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, An"
"thony Goldstein, and Terry Boot "
had finished using a wide variety 
of the hexes and jinxes Harry had 
"taught them, Malfoy, Crabbe, and "
Goyle resembled nothing so much 
as three gigantic slugs squeezed 
"into Hogwarts uniforms as Harry, "
"Ernie, and Justin hoisted them into"
 the luggage rack and left them 
there to ooze. 
"“I must say, I’m looking forward to seeing Malfoy’s mother’s face "
"when he gets off the train,” said Er"
"nie with some satisfaction, as he "
watched Malfoy squirm above him. 
Ernie had never quite got over the 
indignity of Malfoy docking points 
from Hufflepuff during his brief 
spell as a member of th
e Inquisitorial Squad. 
"“Goyle’s mum’ll be really pleased, though,” said Ron, who had "
come to investigate the source of 
the commotion. “He’s loads better- 
   865 "looking now. . . . Anyway, Harry, the "
food trolley’s just stopped if you 
want anything. . . .” 
Harry thanked the others and a
ccompanied Ron back to their 
"compartment, where he bought a large pile of Cauldron Cakes and "
Pumpkin Pasties. Hermione was reading the 
Daily Prophet
" again, "
Ginny was doing a quiz in 
"The Quibbler,"
 and Neville was stroking his 
"Mimbulus mimbletonia,"
 which had grown a great deal over the year 
and now made odd crooning 
noises when touched. 
Harry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard 
chess while Hermione read out snippets from the 
Prophet.
 It was now 
full of articles about how to repe
"l dementors, atte"
mpts by the Min-
"istry to track down Death Eaters, and hysterical letters claiming that "
the writer had seen Lord Voldemort wa
lking past their house that very 
morning. . . . 
"“It hasn’t really started yet,” si"
"ghed Hermione gloomily, folding up "
the newspaper again. “But it 
won’t be long now. . . .” 
"“Hey, Harry,” said Ron, nodding to"
ward the glass window onto the 
corridor. 
Harry looked around. Cho was passi
"ng, accompanied by Marietta "
"Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. His and Cho’s eyes met for "
a moment. Cho blushed and kept 
walking. Harry looked back down 
at the chessboard just in time to 
see one of his pawns chased off its 
square by Ron’s knight. 
“What’s — er — going on with you and her anyway?” Ron asked 
quietly. 
"“Nothing,” said Harry truthfully. "
"“I — er — heard she’s going out with someone else now,” said "
Hermione tentatively. 
Harry was surprised to find that 
this information did not hurt at 
all. Wanting to impress Cho seemed 
to belong to a past that was no 
longer quite connected with him. So
 much of what he had wanted  
 866 before Sirius’s death felt that way 
these days. . . . The week that had 
"elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, "
much longer: It stretched across two 
"universes, the one with Sirius in "
"it, and the one without. "
"“You’re well out of it, mate,” sa"
"id Ron forcefully. “I mean, she’s "
"quite good-looking and all that, bu"
t you want someone a bit more 
cheerful.” 
“She’s probably cheerful enough wi
"th someone else,” said Harry, "
shrugging. 
“Who’s she with now anyway?” 
"Ron asked Hermione, but it was "
Ginny who answered. 
"“Michael Corner,” she said. "
"“Michael — but —” said Ron, cran"
ing around in hi
s seat to stare 
at her. “But you were going out with him!” 
"“Not anymore,” said Ginny resolutely. “He didn’t like Gryffindor "
beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch and go
"t really sulky, so I ditched him "
and he ran off to comfort Cho inst
ead.” She scratched her nose ab-
"sently with the end of her quill, turned "
The Quibbler
" upside down, "
and began marking her answers. 
Ron looked highly delighted. 
"“Well, I always thought he was a bi"
"t of an idiot,” he said, prodding "
his queen forward toward Harry’s qu
ivering castle. “Good for you. 
Just choose someone — better — next time.” 
He cast Harry an oddly furt
ive look as he said it. 
"“Well, I’ve chosen Dean"
" Thomas, would you say "
he’s better?” asked 
Ginny vaguely. 
"“WHAT?” shouted Ron, upending the chessboard. Crookshanks "
went plunging after the pieces an
d Hedwig and Pigw
idgeon twittered 
and hooted angrily from overhead. 
As the train slowed down in the a
"pproach to King’s Cross, Harry "
thought he had never wanted to leav
e it less. He even wondered fleet-
ingly what would happen if he simply 
"refused to get off, but remained  "
   867 stubbornly sitting there until the 
"first of September, when it would "
take him back to Hogwarts. When 
"it finally puffed to a standstill, "
"however, he lifted down Hedwig’s cage and prepared to drag his trunk "
from the train as usual. 
When the ticket inspector signal
"ed to him, Ron, and Hermione "
that it was safe to walk through th
e magical barrier between platforms 
"nine and ten, however, he found a su"
rprise awaiting him on the other 
side: a group of people standing th
ere to greet him whom he had not 
expected at all. 
"There was Mad-Eye Moody, looking "
quite as sinister with his 
bowler hat pulled low over his ma
gical eye as he would have done 
"without it, his gnarled hands clutchin"
"g a long staff, his body wrapped "
in a voluminous traveling cloak.
" Tonks stood just behind him, her "
bright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering 
through the dirty glass station ceil
"ing, wearing heavily patched jeans "
and a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend 
the weird sisters
. 
"Next to Tonks was Lupin, his face "
"pale, his hair graying, a long and "
threadbare overcoat covering a sh
abby jumper and trousers. At the 
front of the group stood Mr. and Mr
"s. Weasley, dressed in their Mug-"
"gle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new "
"jackets in some lurid green, scaly material. "
"“Ron, Ginny!” called Mrs. Weasle"
"y, hurrying forward and hugging "
"her children tightly. “Oh, an"
d Harry dear — how are you?” 
"“Fine,” lied Harry, as she pulled hi"
m into a tight embrace. Over her 
shoulder he saw Ron goggling 
at the twins’ 
new clothes. 
“What are 
they
" supposed to be?” he asked,"
 pointing at the jackets. 
"“Finest dragon skin, little bro,” sa"
"id Fred, giving his zip a little "
tweak. “Business is booming and we thought we’d treat ourselves.” 
"“Hello, Harry,” said Lupin, as Mr"
s. Weasley let go of Harry and 
turned to greet Hermione. 
"“Hi,” said Harry. “I didn’t expect "
. . . what are you all doing here?” 
 868 "“Well,” said Lupin with a slight "
"smile, “we thought we might have "
a little chat with your aunt and 
uncle before letting them take you 
home.” 
"“I dunno if that’s a good idea,” said Harry at once. "
"“Oh, I think it is,” growled Moody"
", who had limped a little closer. "
"“That’ll be them, will it, Potter?” "
He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder; his magical eye was 
evidently peering through the back 
of his head and his bowler hat. 
Harry leaned an inch or so to the 
left to see where Mad-Eye was point-
"ing and there, sure enough, were"
" the three Dursleys, who looked "
positively appalled to see 
Harry’s reception committee. 
"“Ah, Harry!” said Mr. Weasley, tu"
"rning from Hermione’s parents, "
whom he had been greeting enthusiast
"ically, and who were taking it in "
turns to hug Hermione. “Well 
"— shall we do it, then?” "
"“Yeah, I reckon so, "
"Arthur,” said Moody. "
He and Mr. Weasley took the lead across the station toward the 
"place where the Dursleys stood, ap"
parently rooted to the floor. 
Hermione disengaged herself gently
 from her mother to join the 
group. 
"“Good afternoon,” said Mr. Weasle"
"y pleasantly to Uncle Vernon, "
coming to a halt right in front of 
"him. “You might remember me, my "
name’s Arthur Weasley.” 
As Mr. Weasley had singlehandedly demolished most of the Durs-
leys’ living room two years previo
"usly, Harry would have been very "
surprised if Uncle Vernon had fo
"rgotten him. Sure enough, Uncle "
"Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr. Weasley, but "
"chose not to say anything, partly, pe"
"rhaps, because the Dursleys were "
outnumbered two to one. Aunt Pe
tunia looked both frightened and 
embarrassed. She kept glancing arou
"nd, as though terrified somebody "
she knew would see her in such co
"mpany. Dudley, meanwhile, seemed "
to be trying to look small and insign
"ificant, a feat at which he was fail-"
ing extravagantly. 
   869 "“We thought we’d just have a few words with you about Harry,” "
"said Mr. Weasley, still smiling. "
"“Yeah,” growled Moody. “About how "
he’s treated when he’s at your 
place.” 
Uncle Vernon’s mustache seemed to
 bristle with indignation. Possi-
bly because the bowler hat gave hi
m the entirely mistaken impression 
"that he was dealing with a kindred spirit, he addressed himself to "
Moody. 
“I am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my 
house —” 
"“I expect what you’re not aware of would fill several books, Durs-"
"ley,” growled Moody. "
"“Anyway, that’s not th"
"e point,” interjected To"
"nks, whose pink hair "
seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more 
"than all the rest put together, for "
she closed her eyes rather than look 
"at her. “The point is, if we find "
out you’ve been horr
ible to Harry —” 
"“— and make no mistake, we’"
"ll hear about it,” added Lupin "
pleasantly. 
"“Yes,” said Mr. Weasley, “even if you won’t let Harry use the "
fellytone —” 
“
"Telephone,"
” whispered Hermione. 
"“Yeah, if we get any hint that Po"
"tter’s been mistreated in any way, "
you’ll have us to an
"swer to,” said Moody. "
Uncle Vernon swelled ominously. His sense of outrage seemed to 
outweigh even his fear of 
this bunch of oddballs. 
"“Are you threatening me, sir?” he sa"
"id, so loudly that passersby ac-"
tually turned to stare. 
"“Yes, I am,” said Mad-Eye, who se"
emed rather pleased that Uncle 
Vernon had grasped this
 fact so quickly. 
“And do I look like the kind of
 man who can be intimidated?” 
barked Uncle Vernon. 
"“Well . . .” said Moody, pushing ba"
ck his bowler hat to reveal his 
 870 sinisterly revolving magical eye. Un
cle Vernon leapt backward in hor-
ror and collided painfull
"y with a luggage trolley. “Yes, I’d have to say "
"you do, Dursley.” "
"He turned from Uncle Vernon to Harry. “So, Potter . . . give us a "
shout if you need us. If we don’t hear
" from you for three days in a row, "
we’ll send someone along. . . .” 
Aunt Petunia whimpered piteously. 
It could not have been plainer 
that she was thinking of what the 
neighbors would say if they caught 
sight of these people marc
hing up the garden path. 
"“’Bye, then, Potter,” said Moody, "
grasping Harry’s shoulder for a 
moment with a gnarled hand. 
"“Take care, Harry,” said Lupin quietly. “Keep in touch.” "
"“Harry, we’ll have you away from there as soon as we can,” Mrs. "
"Weasley whispered, hugging him again. "
"“We’ll see you soon, mate,” said"
" Ron anxiously, shaking Harry’s "
hand. 
"“Really soon, Harry,” said Herm"
ione earnestly. “We promise.” 
Harry nodded. He somehow could 
not find words to tell them 
"what it meant to him, to see them al"
"l ranged there, on his side. Instead "
"he smiled, raised a hand in farewell, turned around, and led the way "
out of the station toward the sunlit
" street, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt "
"Petunia, and Dudley hurr"
ying along in his wake.
