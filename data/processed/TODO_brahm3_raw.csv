1  WAYS AND MEANS INTO 
JHANA
14
th
 July 1996 
The Buddha says in the 
"Latukikopama"
"Sutta"
", that happiness which is apart from "
"sensuality and pleasure, apart from unwholesome "
dhammas
", should be pursued, that it "
"should be developed, that it should be cultivate, t"
hat it should not be feared.  (see MN 
66.20 & 21) 
I 
want 
to 
take the 
opportunity 
this 
evening 
to 
talk
to 
you 
about 
the 
process 
of 
meditation leading up to 
jhanas
".  Now, just over a fortnight into the Rains Retrea"
"t, is "
the right time for such a talk.  So much external a
ctivity has disappeared and the mind 
and body should have settled down.  The mind should
 now be inclining towards quiet 
and peaceful states of mind.  So now is the right t
ime to talk about how one should 
deal with this mind in order to lead it into very u
seful deep states of peace and bliss. 
Many of you have heard my talks on the subject befo
"re, so you may hear much that is "
repeated.  But because these talks are not pre-plan
ned there will be information that 
you have not heard and that will be helpful to you.
  Anything that helps you to settle 
"the mind, let go of the hindrances, and let go of t"
he world of the five senses will be 
useful to you.  Anything that helps you gain these 
‘
"
uttarimanussadhamma"
"’, these "
"extraordinary conditions, these superior human stat"
es which are worthy of the 
Ariyas
", "
will be very useful to you. 
The Roads to Success 
I spoke in my last talk about the need for sense-re
straint and it goes without saying 
"that sense-restraint gives one the groundwork, the "
"foundation, for taking this mind "
"into a deeper, fuller restraint of the senses, a fu"
"ller letting go of the many, many places "
where the mind dwells.  We need to go into a deeper
" place inside the mind, a place of "
"great peace and bliss, a very profound place which "
gives you great insights into the 
nature of the mind.  You can then see what the mind
 is capable of and how it feels to 
be in those states.  You see what those states are 
and how they come about. 
5
This gives one great insights into a world which we
 cannot know unless we have been 
"there.  These worlds, these "
samadhi
" states, are so strange compared to the external "
world that they are very difficult to describe.  Th
ose who have not been there find it 
very difficult to even understand that such states 
can exist. 
One has to start from the very beginning.  Having p
ractised some sense-restraint there 
comes a time when one sits down on one's cushion or
" stool.  Sitting very still, one "
starts training the mind.  That initial training of
 the mind should begin with what the 
Buddha called the 
iddhipadas
.  The 
iddhipadas
 are the four roads or bases of success 
or power.  The 
iddhipadas
are what empowers you to actually succeed in this p
rocess 
of meditation.  The 
iddhipadas
 are the arousing of a desire for the goal.  The fi
rst 
iddhipada
is 
chanda
samadhi
 – the maintaining of desire for the goal.  This is
 a 
prerequisite for gaining any success in this medita
tion.  If you do not set yourself a 
"goal, then you will not set up the desire or moveme"
"nt of the mind to achieve that goal, "
and there will be no results.  You do not get to a 
‘one-pointed mind’ by allowing the 
mind to wander around.  The wandering mind will nev
er get close.  It needs to be 
"directed, to be pointed in the right direction, and"
" that direction, that ‘pointedness’ of "
"the mind, has to be done through a very clear resol"
ution. 
The 
most 
important 
thing 
about 
the 
iddhipadas
is 
that 
this 
resolution 
has 
to 
be 
maintained throughout the course of the meditation.
  If you make a resolution and you 
"maintain it, then you have got a hope for success. "
 If you make that resolution and 
after one or two minutes you forget what you are su
"pposed to be doing, what you are "
"aiming for, then it is very easy to turn a corner a"
nd go backwards or go sideways and 
waste a lot of time.  
These are very profound states and they need a degr
"ee of effort.  Not immense effort, "
but constant effort.  So we take our goal and keep 
it in mind.  That generates energy to 
"achieve the goal, it generates the application of t"
"he mind onto the goal, and the "
investigation of 
dhammas
 that go along with the desire for success.  This i
nvestigation 
of 
the 
Dhamma
is 
vimamsa
samadhi
", "
the 
maintenance 
of 
investigating 
which 
demonstrates that the path of 
samatha
 and 
vipassana
 is the same.  In order to gain 
6
success in meditation you have to also use wisdom. 
" You have to use the desire, the "
"energy, "
the 
application 
of 
the 
"mind, "
and 
the 
wisdom
faculty 
generated 
through 
investigation and inquiry.  In order to gain succes
s all of these factors need to be 
"functioning, and they need to be maintained through"
out the meditation. 
When I define the word 
samadhi
" as the sustaining of these things, you can see tha"
t if 
you sustain the 
iddhipadas
" – these roads to success, these functions of the m"
ind – then 
your meditation will be successful.  If you do not 
maintain these functions of the 
"mind, then the meditation does not succeed – one fo"
rgets. 
Setting the Goals 
It is very helpful at the beginning of the meditati
on to set a goal clearly in mind – it 
should be achievable but at the same time test you 
rather than just sitting down to 
meditate 
to 
see 
what 
happens. 
What 
happens 
is 
that
you 
will 
probably 
see 
a 
"wandering mind, especially if you have not had succ"
ess in deep states of tranquillity 
before.  Set a goal that becomes the means to gener
ate the 
iddhipadas
.  Do not be 
afraid of desiring a goal. 
We just chanted the 
Dhammacakkappavattana
"Sutta"
" (SN 56.11), the first sermon of "
"the Buddha.  In that sermon, the Buddha talked abou"
t the noble truths.  The second 
"noble truth is the cause of suffering, "
"dukkha"
"samudaya"
".  The cause is craving, which "
"leads to rebirth, which seeks delight here and ther"
"e, and which is associated with "
pleasure and lust.  That craving is called 
kama
tanha
:  the craving for the delights of 
the 
world 
of 
the 
five 
"senses, "
the 
craving 
for 
exist
"ence, "
and 
the 
craving 
for 
annihilation.  These are the cravings that give ris
e to rebirth.  In contrast the desire or 
aspiration for 
jhana
 to the end of rebirth and is part of the 
iddhipadas
", because it "
generates the Eightfold Path and the Seven Factors 
of Enlightenment. 
"When you have a chance to meditate, make clear what"
 you want to gain from the 
meditation and keep that goal in mind.  
The goal that I encourage is to gain the first 
jhana
", because that will equip you with an experiential "
knowledge of some other-
worldly-state.  It will also train you to let go of
 those coarse defilements that we call 
the hindrances.  The coarser defilements are the on
es which keep us attached to the 
7
rupaloka
", "
even 
though 
we 
are 
only 
abandoning 
them 
temporari
ly. 
We 
have 
to 
abandon things temporarily so that we can get used 
"to being apart from them, and then "
eventually we can abandon them fully.  It is just l
ike a person who comes to a 
"monastery temporarily, then goes back into the worl"
"d again, then returns a second "
"time and a third time, until he gets used to abando"
ning the world.  He can then 
abandon it fully and permanently.  But first it is 
important to abandon the world at 
"least temporarily, to see what that is like.  So, t"
his is the goal that I encourage you to 
aim for during this Rains Retreat:  to gain a 
jhana
", just the first "
jhana
.  Having made 
first 
jhana
" one’s goal, one then develops the desire, the ener"
"gy, the application of "
"mind, and the investigation to gain that goal. "
Application of the mind is called 
citta
samadhi
.  The mind has many functions; one of 
these functions is 
"sati,"
 or mindfulness.  You have to maintain mindfulness 
throughout 
the meditation period.  The maintenance of mindfuln
ess means that one maintains full 
"knowledge of what one is doing.  Always, as it were"
", checking up on oneself – not on "
"a verbal level, but just by knowing what one is doi"
ng and fully experiencing the 
content of one’s consciousness from moment to momen
t.  Mindfulness also means 
remembering what one is 
supposed to be doing
 and the goal that one has assigned to 
the meditation.  Mindfulness is maintaining the des
"ire for that goal, the energy, the "
"application of the mind, and the investigation. "
If you do not keep a map with you on the journey yo
u will get lost.  You need to 
maintain that map in your mind.  That is why it is 
helpful – in order to maintain the 
goal and the instructions – to very carefully make 
a resolution to yourself at the 
"beginning of a meditation.  It is well known, even "
"to Western psychology, that if we "
carefully make a resolution to ourselves we will re
"member it.  For example, by "
making a resolution three times with as much care a
"nd mindfulness as we can, we find "
"that we recall it, and we remember it for a long ti"
me.  The more effort we put into 
making that resolution the more impression it makes
 on our mind and the longer it 
stays in the mind.  By making that firm resolution 
"at the beginning, it shows that we "
are 
meticulous 
in 
the 
process 
of 
meditation. 
We 
wi
ll 
not 
waste 
time 
with 
the 
wandering mind.

The Experience of Breathing 
"So, having made a resolution, this is what you are "
aiming for:  to keep the 
iddhipadas
"going, to maintain the desire for this state, to ma"
intain the energy; the application of 
"mind, and the investigation.  At that point you can"
 start looking at your meditation 
object.  The easiest meditation object you will fin
d to gain 
jhana
 will be the breath.  
"You can try other things, but I would encourage you"
 to keep the main object of 
meditation the experience of breathing.  That was t
he meditation that the Buddha used 
and that the forest monks in Thailand use.  It is t
he most popular meditation object 
and there is a reason for that.  It is the most con
venient way into the 
jhana
 states.  
"Other ways may be used, but if you can’t sustain yo"
ur attention on the breathing it is 
very unlikely that you will be able to sustain your
 attention on other things.  It is the 
ability of the mind to sustain attention that is th
e function of 
samadhi
 and it is that 
which leads one into 
jhanas
.  The meditation object is not as important as one
’s ability 
to hold it. 
"If one is going to use the breath, then there are a"
 couple of tricks that are extremely 
useful.  The first ‘skilful means’ is to make sure 
that you are watching the feeling of 
the 
"breath, "
not 
the 
thought 
of 
the 
breath. 
There 
i
s 
a 
great 
difference 
between 
experience and commentary.  If you get accustomed i
n your meditation to knowing 
and staying with the experience and discarding the 
"commentary, then you will find "
that 
your 
mediation 
becomes 
much 
easier. 
You 
can 
d
iscard 
the 
commentary 
throughout the day.  Make a resolution that you wil
l try to restrict the commentary 
you make on life and become more attentive to the b
are experience of life.  The 
making of that resolution will arouse the mindfulne
ss necessary to stop the inner 
conversation.  You do not listen to it; you are not
 interested in it.  You are more 
interested in the actual experience. 
"Secondly, when you are watching the breath, have th"
e full experience of the breath.  
Do not think about it.  Do not note it; do not say 
anything about it; just know it.  The 
"simpler you can make the meditation object, the mor"
e powerful it will become.  This 
is the reason why I encourage you to put your atten
tion on the breath and not to 
concern yourself about where the experience or feel
ing is located in your body.  If you 
are concerned about where the breath is located in 
"the body, that concern brings up "
9
too much body-awareness.  With body-awareness distu
"rbances of the body will arise, "
"such as painful and pleasant feelings, heat and col"
"d, itches, aches and pains, and other "
"feelings.  Whatever those feelings are, this body i"
s a mess of painful and pleasant 
"feelings.  It is a cacophony of different sounds, n"
ever giving one any respite or peace.  
So the quicker one can take one’s attention from th
"e physical body, the better it is for "
success in meditation.  Just know the experience of
 breath and do not concern yourself 
with where it might be in the physical body. 
The way to use the experience of breath to take you
 into a 
jhana
 state is as follows.  
The first task is to be able to sustain your attent
ion fully on the breath.  This is getting 
into 
samadhi
", the sustained attention on the coarse object of b"
reathing.  This should 
not be difficult for anyone.  If you cannot sustain
" your attention on the breath, which "
"is a coarse object, then it is impossible to sustai"
"n the attention on anything finer, such "
as the 
samadhi
nimitta
", the sign of concentration, which arises later.  I"
t will be 
impossible for you to sustain your attention on any
 aspect of the mind – such as the 
khandhas
", the aggregates associated with the mind – enough "
to gain true insight into 
their nature.  These are very refined things and to
 be able to fully know them you have 
to hold them before the ‘eyes’ of your mind long en
ough to fully penetrate their 
depths. 
We have to start by developing the ability of the m
ind to sustain its attention on the 
coarse breath.  This is 
a process that requires lots of endurance and persi
stence
", but "
here 
are 
some 
helpful 
hints. 
I 
have 
already 
mentio
ned 
one 
of 
"them, "
that 
"is, "
"remembering what we are supposed to be doing, to ma"
ke sure that mindfulness is very 
clear.  Very often in our meditation the mind wande
rs off because it forgets what it is 
"supposed to be doing.  Imagine there was someone, a"
"s it were, just behind you "
watching every moment and as soon as you wandered o
"ff he reminded you, ‘You have "
lost the breath’.  You’d find that you would not wa
nder off far.  You would be 
training the mind to stay with the breath.  No one 
"else can do that for you, only the "
mindfulness that you establish through your resolut
ion. 
"However, there is another important trick, a skilfu"
l means that can help you maintain 
the awareness of the breath.  It comes through unde
rstanding why the mind wanders 
10
off in the first place.  Know the ways of this thin
g we call the mind.  The mind seeks 
"pleasure, happiness, and contentment.  If the mind "
can’t find contentment with the 
"breath, it will try to find it elsewhere, it will w"
"ander off.  Sometimes, no matter how "
"strong our mindfulness is, we find that by trying t"
o force the attention to remain with 
the breath it just creates tension.  This happens b
ecause we are forcing the mind 
against its will to stay in a place where it does n
ot want to be – with the breath.  The 
way 
to 
overcome 
that 
problem 
and 
remain 
with 
the 
br
eath 
without 
needing 
to 
constantly apply enormous amounts of mindfulness an
d will power is to make it 
enjoyable. 
Make the breath a pleasant abiding so that the mind
 finds happiness and satisfaction 
by remaining with the breath.  We do that by develo
ping the perception of a happy 
"breath, a peaceful beautiful breath.  That is not t"
oo difficult to do with training.  If you 
"can remind yourself, when meditating, to develop th"
e perception of joy and happiness 
"with the breath, you will find that the mind remain"
s on the breath with very little 
difficulty.  One way of doing that is to develop lo
ving kindness towards the breath.  
Loving kindness towards an object sees only the joy
"ful, beautiful, and positive aspects "
of that object.  If you can develop that positive w
ay of looking at the breath when it 
"comes in and goes out, you will find that the mind "
will naturally just want to remain 
with it.  It will not be so interested in those oth
er sensory phenomena that try to steal 
your attention away. 
Once one can develop a perception of the breath as 
"a beautiful abiding, one finds it "
easier to achieve the goal of full awareness of the
 breath.  This goal is achieved when 
the mindfulness remains continuously with the breat
h from the very beginning of an 
"in-breath right to its end, noticing any gaps betwe"
en the in and out-breaths.  See the 
out-breath from its beginning to its end.  And so o
"n with the next in-breath, for breath "
"after breath, after breath. "
You may notice certain stages in this full awarenes
s of the breath.  The first stage is 
when you are actually holding it with a little bit 
of force.  The reason you have to hold 
"the breath with some sort of force, at this particu"
lar time is because the mind is yet to 
be settled on the breath.  The indication of this i
s that you are aware of other things in 
the background.  This shows you have awareness of o
"ther objects – sounds, feelings, "
11
and thoughts – apart from the experience of the bre
ath.  It means that the mind is yet 
to be fully involved in the breath.  The mind is st
ill keeping these other things on the 
"backburner, so to speak, ‘just in case’.  It has no"
t yet fully abandoned interest in those 
other objects. 
One way of overcoming this problem is to maintain t
he attention on the breath by 
putting the breath in the centre of your mind’s ‘fi
eld of vision’.  I am using ‘field of 
"vision’ as a metaphor.  The mind does not see, the "
"mind experiences, but we have to "
use a metaphor from the world of sight to talk abou
t the mind.  The central object in 
your mind should always be the breath.  If there ar
e any disturbances – disturbances 
"mean anything other than the experience of breath, "
including thoughts and orders 
from yourself – keep them on the edge of your aware
ness.  Keep your mind fully 
"focussed on the full experience of the breath, deve"
loping joy in this breath.  This will 
keep it centred. 
"We find that when the mind wanders, it wanders from"
 what was once our centre to 
one of these peripheral objects.  Those peripheral 
"objects, as it were, take over our "
"mind, become the object of our attention, and the b"
reath just disappears off the edge 
"of the screen, like something falling off the edge "
of the table into the great void.  We 
"have lost the breath!  However, if we keep the expe"
rience of the breath in the centre of 
"our mental screen and maintain our attention there,"
 then it is only a matter of time 
before all those peripheral objects themselves will
 fall off the screen and disappear.  
This is because the result of focussing our attenti
on on one thing is for the mind to 
"narrow down, for the field to get smaller and small"
"er, until it just sees what is in the "
centre.  What was on the edge becomes completely ou
t of vision and you are left with 
just the experience of the breath.  This is the way
" one drops attention to the body, "
drops attention to sounds and such things as though
"ts, which can roam around in the "
mind. 
"If one focuses just on the breath, on the experienc"
"e of the breath, and maintains that "
"long enough, everything else disappears, except for"
 the experience of the breath.  If 
everything else has disappeared and we only have th
e full experience of the breath 
"from moment to moment maintained for a long time, t"
hen we know that we have the 
first level of what really can be called 
samadhi
.  We have an object and we have 
12
maintained our attention on it.  When we have attai
ned to this stage our attention 
should be relatively effortless because we have alr
eady abandoned the disturbances.  
They have fallen off the screen.  We have full atte
"ntion on a coarse object, the breath.  "
In 
the 

"Sutta"
(MN 
118) 
that 
stage 
is 
called 
"!!""""#"
", "
experiencing the whole body of the breath.  The who
le body of the breath means 
just 
the breath
", fully on the breath.  Fully means that there is n"
o room for anything else.  
All other disturbances have no door into the mind a
t this stage. 
It is not all that necessary to develop a perceptio
n of a ‘beautiful breath’ at this stage.  
It is so peaceful just watching the breath from its
 beginning to its end.  The thoughts 
have 
been 
given 
up. 
The 
sounds 
have 
disappeared 
an
d 
the 
body 
is 
no 
longer 
disturbing you.  Just gaining this much is a great 
release for the mind.  The mind has 
"let go of a lot at this stage, in fact it has let g"
o of many of the hindrances.  It has only a 
little bit of restlessness left to truly overcome. 
"Once we have got to this stage, we need to know it "
and maintain it.  We need to start 
the fourth practice in the 

"Sutta"
:  the 
!
"""$"
", the "
settling down and tranquillising of the object of m
editation.  Once we have 
samadhi
on the object – 
and not before
 – we tranquillise or calm the object.  If you find
 that 
you are unable to maintain your attention on such a
" fine object, make the object a bit "
coarser.  I remember Ajahn Chah once teaching that 
if you lose attention on the breath 
"and you cannot find the breath, just stop breathing"
 for a few moments.  The next 
breath will be a very coarse breath and you will fi
nd it easy to watch.  You have been 
"breathing but the breath became very refined, too r"
efined for you to notice.  So you 
have to stay with a coarser object and keep on that
 coarser object until you can really 
maintain full attention on it.  Sometimes this is a
" bit restraining and restricting, "
because very often at this stage you are getting ve
ry close to very beautiful states of 
mind. 
Sometimes you may want to rush forward into a 
samadhi
Citta
", or rush into a "
jhana
.  But you will find that if you do not make this s
tage of full awareness of the 
"breath solid, a "
samadhi
Citta
", once it arises, will very quickly disappear again"
; and 
if you do go into a 
jhana
", you will bounce straight out again.  That is beca"
use the 
13
faculty of the mind to sustain and hold an object f
or a long period of time – enough 
for the 
jhana
 to fully develop and to maintain itself – has not 
been developed.  We 
"have to constantly train the mind at this stage, on"
" the full awareness of the breath, "
until we have that ability.  If we can maintain ful
l awareness of the breath and all 
"other objects disappear, then we can start to quiet"
en the breath down.  We allow the 
"breath to settle, until the physical feeling of the"
 breath starts to give way to its mental 
counterpart. 
The Passive Mind 
With experience we begin to see that there seems to
 be a physical part and a mental 
part to any experience.  When that physical part di
sappears it reveals the mental part.  
We begin to experience how the mind ‘sees’ the brea
"th, not how the body feels the "
breath.  The function of body consciousness disappe
ars.  The last of the five senses in 
"their very refined form disappear.  The eye, the ea"
"r, smell, taste, and bodily feeling "
"have all shut down, except for just the feeling of "
"the breath.  The five senses have, as "
"it were, only one thread left, this experience of t"
he breath.  Now we are also shutting 
"that one down, as we quieten the breath down. "
This is the stage where the 
samadhi
Citta
 starts to arise.  Only if one has been able 
to maintain full attention on the breath for long p
"eriods of time, will one be able to "
handle the 
samadhi
Citta
.  The ability to maintain attention on the breath 
for long 
periods of time needs the passive aspect of the min
d.  One can say that the mind has 
two functions.  The mind has the passive function t
o receive information from the 
"senses, what we call ‘the function to know’, and it"
 also has the active function of 
"interacting, what we might call ‘the function to do"
"’.  In this meditation, when one gets "
"to these refined stages of mind, the main function "
has to be just to ‘know’.  The 
"‘doing’ function has to be almost dead, with just t"
"he last little piece left, which is "
finally 
going 
to 
guide 
the 
mind 
into 
a 
jhana
where 
the 
function 
of 
‘doing’ 
is 
completely suppressed and abandoned.  In a 
jhana
" one just ‘knows’, one cannot ‘do’.  "
The function of the mind that is active has passed 
"away and the function that ‘knows’, "
"or receives, is the only thing left.  So remember t"
hat the mind has to be passive in 
"these states, it has to be like a passenger, not a "
driver.  Once one can do this with a 
coarse breath one can manage to do this with a 
samadhi
Citta
 when it arises. 
14
I should mention that the so called 
samadhi
Citta
 is not a light but that is the 
closest description the mind can give to this exper
ience.  
It is an object of mind 
consciousness
", not an object eye consciousness.  However, becaus"
e of its intensity it 
very often appears as a light.  However it is perce
"ived, it is something very pleasant "
and appealing.  The mind has to be able to hold its
 attention on the 
Citta
 without 
moving and to do that it has to be very passive.  B
ecause any action of the mind to 
"interfere, to control, to do; to order. to make, wi"
ll disturb that tranquillity of the mind 
and the 
samadhi
Citta
 will disappear.  You will be back on the breath or
 you will 
go way back to the beginning of your meditation. 
I talk like this to plant the instructions in your 
"minds, and so hopefully at the right "
"time, you will remember the instructions and act ac"
cordingly.  You have to remember 
at this point that instead of trying to interfere w
ith the 
samadhi
Citta
", you leave it "
alone and just hold it in your mind.  You will then
 find that you have the ability to 
hold the 
Citta
.  It doesn’t disappear and it doesn’t start to cha
nge.  It is just there 
from moment to moment to moment.  At this point you
 don’t need to put effort into 
trying to hold the 
Citta
; the effort will come from the mind itself.  The 
samadhi
Citta
 will always be attractive to the mind.  It’s a pea
"ceful experience, a joyful "
"experience, sometimes very blissful, but the sort o"
f bliss that is not going to disturb 
the mind.  If you have 
samadhi
Citta
" and they are disturbing the mind, it means "
that the mind does not know how to hold them when t
hey are very strong.  It cannot 
leave them alone.  It is not that the 
samadhi
Citta
 or the 
"
"
 disturbs you.  It 
is you disturbing the 
"
"
".  It’s just like Ajahn Chah's simile, ‘Noise does "
not 
disturb you; you disturb the noise.’  
"%
"
 is never disturbing; you’re the one who 
disturbs the 
"
"
.  If you leave it alone it remains because it is t
he mind doing 
this. 
The Gateway into the Mind 
Those of you who like to investigate a lot (
vimamsa
"), who have a very well developed "
"faculty of wisdom, will notice at this point that t"
"here is a difference between the mind, "
citta
", and the delusion of ‘self’.  All of the disturban"
ces come from your delusion of 
"‘self’, that which thinks, controls, and manages.  "
"However, the nature of "
citta
 by itself 
15
– and this is a natural phenomena – will be to go t
owards the 
samadhi
Citta
", hold "
"on to it, and enter into a "
jhana
".  It is you, in the sense of the mirage, which cau"
ses the 
problems.  This is one of the reasons that the more
" one has let go of the sense of ‘self’, "
the easier it is to gain 
jhanas
.  For someone who is a 

", a "
&
", an "
&
 or an 

","
" the higher one's attainments, the easier "
jhanas
 become.  For 
this very reason one should let go of this control 
that comes from 

", ignorance, "
especially from the 

 that is the delusion of a ‘self’.  The ‘self’ alwa
ys wants to 
"control, to speak, to act, or do and it is afraid t"
"o let go of very much, simply because "
that 
means 
letting 
go 
of 
itself. 
"So, "
if 
you 
have 
a
very 
strong 
wisdom 
"faculty, "
"investigate this point.  Not by asking about it, bu"
"t by observing, and asking yourself, "
“Why is it that the 
samadhi
Citta
 is not stable?”  If you can let go of the sense of
"‘self’, just completely abandon all effort to contr"
"ol, to comment, and be completely "
"passive, then the "
citta
 will do the work.  The mind will go on to that 
Citta
 by 
itself. 
The 
samadhi
Citta
 is like a gateway into the mind.  Because you have
 just come 
"from the realm of the five senses, the "
kama 
", you interpret the "
samadhi
Citta
with the language of the five senses.  That is why 
it appears to be a light.  As you 
maintain your attention on the 
samadhi
Citta
", if you go further from the world of "
"the five senses, the perception of the "
samadhi
Citta
 changes.  The perception of 
light disappears and you go to the heart that is ju
st a very pleasant experience which 
we call 
"
"
".  You do not need to think, “What does "
"
"
 mean?”  “What is 

", what is "
"
"
?”  You cannot know the answer to those questions b
y looking at 
the 
"suttas"
.  The only way to know what 
"
"
" means, as it appears in the first "
jhana
", is to gain that first "
jhana
 and know that at this stage it is the object of th
e mind.  
"It is the object of mind consciousness, the one thi"
ng the mind is aware of.  Because 
"
"
" is extremely pleasant, peaceful, and satisfying, t"
he mind finds it very easy to 
find contentment in that one mental image; so the m
ind does the work at this stage. 
You have to let go not only of 
kama 
", the world of the five senses, you have to let "
go also of that function of ‘self’ which tries to c
ontrol.  You cannot do any controlling 
in these 
jhana
 states.  It is wonderful to behold that experience
 which is beyond the 
control 
of 
'
", "
that 
'
which 
manifests 
as 
the 
delusion 
of 
‘self’. 
'
is 
16
blindfolded in these states.  The illusion of a ‘se
lf’ wants to struggle to ‘be’; and by 
"being, it does, acts, orders; controls, manipulates"
", and manages what it thinks is its "
home – that is existence.  All that is abandoned.  
"That is why, by gaining a first "
jhana
", "
you have let go of an enormous amount of the world 
"of suffering, of existence.  At "
this stage you will still be fully aware.  The mind
" is still there, the mind still ‘knows’.  "
But at this stage the knowing is a very profound kn
owing. 
The Different Mind 
These 
jhanas
are 
very 
powerful 
experiences 
and 
they 
will 
certai
nly 
impress 
themselves 
on 
the 
mind 
enough 
for 
it 
to 
very 
clearl
y 
remember 
what 
those 
"experiences were when, after some length of time, y"
ou emerge from the 
jhana
.  The 
mind stays in 
jhana
 because it finds full contentment.  At this stage 
it is satisfied with 
the 
"
"
", with the joy of this state.  However, there is a "
defect in that first 
jhana
.  
You will not notice while in that 
jhana
" what the defect is, but you’ll notice it after you"
emerge from the first 
jhana
.  The defect is that the mind is not completely st
ill.  The 
"mind is moving, towards and away from "
"
"
", as if it were oscillating around "
"
"
", because it has not yet fully entered into that st"
ate.  It is still on the journey 
into 
samadhi
.  The mind has not fully settled down.  It is stil
"l wobbling, echoing, and "
vibrating from what was happening before in the rea
lm of the five senses.  That 
wobbling of the mind is what we call 

and 

.  It is not coming from you.  
It is the mind.  
It does not manifest as what we call thinking
.  The mind moving 
towards 
"
"
 is called 

.  The mind holding on to 
"
"
 is what we call 

.  After a while the mind moves away from 
"
"
 and then it has to move 
back on to it again.  It is a very gentle and hardl
"y perceptible movement, to and from "
"
"
.  The mind cannot go very far away; the 
"
"
 remains fully in the 
mind's eye.  It never goes so far that the 
sam

dhi
 state is broken and one feels the 
body. 
The 
"suttas"
 actually say that the ‘thorn’ of the first 
jhana
" is sound.  It will be sound, as "
"the first of the five external senses, which can br"
eak the first 
jhana
.  Within that state 
you will be unable to hear what people are saying n
"ext to you, because the mind is "
fully involved in the 
"
"
" object.  If a sound is heard, it means that the "
samadhi
 of 
that 
jhana
 is already very weak and one is about to exit the 
jhana
.  When I say fully 
17
involved I stress the word ‘fully’.  There is no sp
ace for the mind to receive any other 
input.  It is fully taken up with the joy and happi
ness of the 
"
"
.  It does not let it 
go enough to notice anything else. 
These are strange states to experience.  It is a mi
nd very different from the mind that 
has so many things to deal with in the external wor
ld.  The normal mind has one thing 
come 
to 
its 
attention 
only 
to 
"disappear, "
and 
then 
s
omething 
else 
comes 
up 
and 
"disappears, and then something else again.  The min"
"d normally has such a heavy load, "
"such a burden of information to deal with, but here"
 the mind has just one pleasant 
object.  It is the pleasantness of that object whic
h keeps the mind attached to the 
"
"
.  Do not be afraid of that attachment.  It is the 
attachment that led the 
"Buddha to Enlightenment, which led many "

 to full Enlightenment.  At this 
stage you can’t do anything about it anyway.  This 
becomes the experience of the first 
jhana
. 
Later on that 
""""
", that last wobbling of the mind, is abandoned.  Re"
member 
that the first 
jhana
 is just less than the second 
jhana
", just less than full "
samadhi
", that "
full ‘one-pointedness of 
mind’
 on the object.  
Venerable S

riputta describes a 
jhana
 just in between the first and second 
jhanas
","
where the movement of the mind onto the object has 
been abandoned.  In that 
jhana
there is no 

", all that is left is "

". (See A IV 300 & 440 f, S IV 360-363, D "
"III 219, M III 162).  That state is when the mind h"
as 
"
"
 fully and does not 
"move away from it but, as it were, grasps the "
"
"
".  The mind holds on to it, not "
realising that it doesn’t need to grasp it or put f
orth any effort to hold it.  The mind is 
"doing this, not the illusion of ‘self’.  At this st"
age it is very common that the mind will 
let go of the holding and stay there by itself acco
rding to natural causes and results.  
"The cause is the inner contentment of the mind, bei"
ng with the beautiful 
"
"
; the 
beautiful happiness and one-pointedness of mind.  T
he mind remains there as a solid 
"object.  The mind comes to oneness, comes to a ‘poi"
nt’ as it were.  These are not 
things that one knows in this state; it is only whe
n one emerges afterwards – because 
the experience has impressed itself on your mind – 
that you can recall it very vividly.  
It is just as if you remember a very vivid dream.  
Even more vivid are the experiences 
18
of 
jhana
.  You can remember them very clearly after you eme
rge.  It is on emergence 
from 
a 
jhana
that 
you 
see 
the 
jh

na 
mind 
as 
different 
from 
anything 
you 
have 
"experienced before, in the sense of being fully one"
.  It cannot move.  It is like the 
"point of a rock – strong, powerful, blissful, compl"
"etely immobile – the immovable, "
immobile mind of the second 
jhana
.  You can only know these states afterwards; 
"during the experience the mind remains immobile, ju"
"st as one thing, as one object.  "
The continuance of the mental object does not chang
e; it just remains one thing 
moment after moment after moment.  The mental objec
t is neither expanding nor 
contracting; it is not changing in quality but just
 remaining with that sameness.  This I 
call the ‘one-pointedness in time’ of the 
Citta
", the sign of mental consciousness. "
"We see what is possible with consciousness, with th"
e mind.  The only way we can 
know mind is by knowing its objects.  Its objects a
re what define the mind.  Once we 
"know the different objects of the mind, including t"
he 
samadhi
" objects, then we get "
some enormous insights and understandings into what
" this mind truly is, what it is "
"capable of, and what happiness and suffering are.  "
Once we start to get into these 
states then we know what the Buddha meant by a plea
sant abiding.  The Buddha 
sometimes called these states ‘
!!
 here and now’.  The Buddha would also very 
often equate 
!!
 and 

", cessation.  Even though it is not true "
!!
", it is "
close.  Why is it close?  It is close because a lot
 of cessation has already occurred.  In 
"these very refined states a lot has ceased, by ceas"
"ing it has ended, disappeared, "
finished.  That is why it is very close to 
!!
.  
"As we develop these states, not only does it give u"
"s a pleasant feeling, but it also "
makes our lives as monks secure.  Only when we have
 the knowledge and experience 
of 

"
"
", the happiness which is apart from the world of th"
"ings, can we fully "
have contentment in monastic life.  If you have not
 had the experience of the 

"
"
", the happiness of renunciation, your renunciation "
will always be a struggle.  
You may be able to renounce on the surface and on t
"he outside, appearing to others to "
"be an excellent monk, but inside the mind still yea"
rns for happiness and satisfaction.  
You will not stop the mind from searching for that 
happiness and satisfaction in the 
world 
when 
it 
hasn’t 
got 
any 
other 
recourse. 
In 
on

of 
the 
"suttas"

(MN 
"14), "
Mah
ā
n
ā
"ma, one of the Buddha's cousins, came up to the Bud"
dha and said that even 
19
though he was a Noble disciple passion still invade
d his mind from time to time.  The 
Buddha replied that it was because he was still att
ached to something.  He had not 
given up everything.  What he was attached to was 
kama 
 and that illusory self 
which seeks for pleasure and control in this world.
"So, this is what one has to do, and every one of yo"
"u here can do it.  Don't rush, be "
"patient, be persistent, and these things will happe"
n.  You have all got sufficient 
morality.  You have all got sufficient sense-restra
int.  You can still increase each one 
"of these, but they are sufficient.  What one truly "
needs is this meticulous application 
"of the mind and doing things properly, rather than "
rushing and doing things sloppily.  
"There is a right way to sew a robe, there is a righ"
"t way to wash your bowl, and there is "
a right way to meditate.  If you are sloppy then yo
u find that you can waste many 
"years.  If you are meticulous, then you will find t"
hat progress happens.  These things 
occur through natural causes.  You are not a factor
; you are just an obstacle to the 
attainments.  So get your ‘self’ out of the way and
 allow these things to happen.  Then 
you to will enjoy the bliss of 
jhanas
", and your monastic life will be assured.  Your "
power 
towards 
insights 
will 
be 
strengthened 
enormou
sly. 
In 
"fact, "
with 
all 
your 
knowledge of the 
Dhamma
", the teachings of the "
(
", it is very unlikely that you "
won't get attainments.  As the Buddha said in the 
%
"Sutta"
" (DN 29), four things "
can 
be 
"expected, "
four 
"benefits, "
from 
practising 
the
jhanas
: 
the 
four 
stages 
of 
Enlightenment.  So may each one of you gain these 
jhanas
 and as the result gain the 
benefits.  People who stay in the monastery for the
 Rains Retreat automatically get the 
"rainy season benefits.  So in much the same way, I "
maintain that if you practice the 
jhanas
 having enough knowledge of the 
Dhamma
", you will certainly get the four "
stages of Enlightenment.  
Now I will leave it up to you.

2  WHY I TELL SILLY JOKES 
Anatta
 and the Five 
)
16
th
 September 1998. 
I have previously mentioned the Three Characteristi
"cs of Existence, the "

""""
 
", "
and this evening I want to expand on that by focusi
ng on 
Metta
 or non-self.  I’m 
doing this so that you can take advantage of the 
samadhi
 you’ve developed so far 
during this Rains Retreat.  This will enable you to
 gain insights into the nature of the 
"mind, the nature of the body, the nature of this un"
"iverse, and in particular to penetrate "
into this truth of 
Metta
.  Penetrating the truth of 
Metta
 is the most fundamental 
"breakthrough.  It is that wisdom, that understandin"
"g, which when it’s attained, will "
"enable you to know that you are a Stream Winner, a "

.  It will also make the 
Dhamma
 of the Lord Buddha abundantly clear.  It will give
 you understanding of 
what this practice is all about and also where it l
eads.  You’ll understand what 
!!
 is and how this whole process works. 
Focussing 
on 
Metta
(non-self) 
is 
a 
most 
important 
part 
of 
vipassana
","
or 
insight 
"practice.  Throughout the retreat, I’ve stressed th"
at you cannot split 
samatha
 and 
vipassana
", and even now I’m not expressing this teaching as "
anything different from 
samatha
. 
I’m 
just 
focussing 
on 
another 
aspect 
of 
the 
prac
tice 
and 
using 
the 
recollection or investigation of 
Metta
" as a means of penetrating truth, as a means of "
developing deeper and deeper calm in the present mo
ment.  Every deep insight that 
you gain should lead to peace and the peace that it
 brings is a measure of that insight. 
Sometimes 
people 
like 
to 
measure 
insight 
with 
convi
ncing 
arguments 
and 
"descriptions, or by their brilliant "
Dhamma
 talks or books.  That is not a measure of 
insight at all.  I’ve known many people who have wr
itten brilliant books without 
having any deep insight at all.  And knowing the na
ture of their lives you can see that 
the understanding they have is basically borrowed f
rom someone else.  It is not their 
own.  The measure of insight is the ability to make
 the mind very peaceful and calm. 
Anyone who experiences deep insight will have no tr
ouble at all in gaining 
jhanas
.  
21
Anyone who claims the experience of insight and can
not access those 
jhanas
 – for me 
anyway – has only superficial insight.  Anyone who 
can gain 
jhanas
 should be gaining 
deep insight.  At the very least insight into the n
"ature of this mind, and how the mind "
plays with the outside world and its senses to its 
own detriment.  When the mind 
"keeps to its own home inside, it experiences far le"
ss 
"dukkha"
 and trouble. 
The String of Pearls 
This evening I want to focus on that practice which
 uncovers 
Metta
", the truth of non-"
self.  Many people are not able to fully understand
 the word 
Metta
.  We only fully 
understand the meaning of these words when the expe
rience arises.  All the words that 
I can use to describe 
Metta
 are only pointing in the direction of the meaning.
  This is 
sometimes a problem when people mistake the words f
or the whole meaning and they 
don’t follow those words to see where they are poin
ting.  
Anatta
 is the truth that this 
"sensory experience, by which we can know the world,"
" is without a being, without a "
"person, without a ‘self’.  As a result of that ther"
"e is nothing that owns, possesses or "
controls.  All that we take to be ‘me’ is just a mi
sconception.  All that we take to be 
‘mine’ results from that misconception.  As a resul
t of taking all this to be ‘mine’ we 
suffer; we weep and wail when things do not go acco
rding to our plans and wishes. 
To understand deeply the nature of non-self and to 
"train ourselves, the Buddha gave "
us the 
Sati		
"Sutta"
 (DN 22).  The whole purpose of 
		
 is to uncover 
this illusion of ‘self’.  Rather than an illusion I
’d like to call it a delusion.  I’ll just 
pause here a moment to mention the difference betwe
en illusion and delusion.  To me 
"anyway, illusion is pointing out that there is abso"
lutely nothing there and we’re 
making something out of just emptiness.  As I under
stand the 
Dhamma
","
Metta
 is not 
illusion it is a delusion.  The 
Metta
 delusion arises because there is something there 
"but we misinterpret it to be a ‘self’, a ‘being’, a"
 ‘me’.  What we misunderstand as 
being ‘me’ or ‘mine’ is actually just a process. 
The word process is the nearest that we can get to 
describing the cause and effect 
relationship that occurs on the level of body and m
ind without there being any core to 
that cause and effect.  One cause arising produces 
an effect and that effect completely 
vanishing causes another effect some time in the fu
"ture, with nothing in between.  It’s "
22
just like a string of pearls that has no string thr
ough them.  If we look closely between 
"two of those adjacent pearls, there’s a space, noth"
ingness.  When we can see that 
space of nothingness we understand there is nothing
 joining those things together 
"except, perhaps, just the process of cause and effe"
"ct.  That’s all, but that’s something "
that is very hard to see.  One of the reasons it’s 
so hard to see is because people aren’t 
looking in that area.  It is the nature of the defi
"lements, of the "
 #
", to stop us "
"looking in that area, to put up all sorts of barrie"
"rs and obstacles which, when they’re "
"removed, can undermine the self’s very reason for e"
xistence. 
Those barriers and obstacles need to be overcome.  
One of the means to overcoming 
them is 
Panna
", or wisdom, some understanding of the Buddha’s tea"
ching.  Another 
"way is confidence and faith, just believing in thos"
e teachings.  Even though a person 
"may have been a Buddhist, even a Buddhist monk or n"
"un, for many years, sometimes "
they don’t have that full confidence in the Lord Bu
ddha’s teachings.  The Buddha said 
that the five 

", starting with "

", the body, are not ‘me’, not ‘mine’, not a "
‘self’.  
+#
", sensation, is not ‘me’, not ‘mine’, not a ‘self’."
Panna
", perception, "
$
", mental formations, and "
**
", consciousness, are not ‘me’, not ‘mine’, "
not a ‘self’.  Yet still some people take conscious
"ness, ‘that which knows’, to be ‘me’, "
"to be ‘mine’, to be a ‘self’.  They take the ‘doer’"
" to be ‘me’, to be ‘mine’, to be a "
‘self’.  They take perception as if they are doing 
"the perceiving, and they take "
#
", "
this feeling of pleasure or pain with each one of t
"he six senses, as personal.  “I hurt, "
"I’m in pain, I am disturbed”, and from that you can"
 see how craving and the whole 
problem of existence arises.  Even this body is tak
"en to be a self, ‘my body’.  That’s "
one reason we are sometimes so concerned with what 
food we put inside our bodies. 
When a person has this delusion of a ‘self’ in thes
"e five areas, it means that they’ll be "
"creating a whole heap of craving, clinging and suff"
ering.  The Buddha taught that it 
takes 
Panna
", and "

", or faith, in order to overcome this delusion.  So"
 how about 
following the Lord Buddha’s instructions?  How abou
t looking at these things as 
‘non-self’?  How about focusing on areas of existen
ce that because of the Lord 
Buddha’s teachings you know are the areas you shoul
d put your attention on? 
What Do I Take Myself to Be? 
23
Sometimes people have so little confidence in the B
uddha that they even think they’ve 
completely abolished the view that ‘self’ is identi
"cal to the body, or the ‘self’ is in the "
"body, "
or 
the 
‘self’ 
controls 
this 
body 
of 
ours. 
Th
e 
Lord 
Buddha 
said 
in 
the 
Sati		
"Sutta"
", that you should really look at this body and say:"
  “Is there anything 
"in here that I take to be a ‘self’, that I take to "
"be ‘me’, that I take to be ‘mine’?”  Don’t "
come to a conclusion too quickly. 
Take the body as a focus of your contemplation and 
by contemplation I mean just 
focussing your awareness on the body and noticing h
ow you relate to it.  Notice how 
"you think about this body, notice what you do with "
"it, as if you truly are stepping back "
from this whole process of mind and body.  See the 
"connection between them, see "
how the delusion of ‘self’ connects and controls th
e body.  It needs the sustained 
"application of ‘insight practice’, just looking or "
observing the attitudes you have to 
your body.  There comes a time when you start to se
e the very deep and subtle 
"attachments, the very, very fine threads of delusio"
"n, which make this body a problem.  "
"You can make this body ‘mine’, you can make this bo"
dy ‘me’.  These delusions are 
deep and profound and they’ve been there for a long
 time.  These delusions are hidden 
"but they can be seen, they can be extricated or dis"
entangled. 
That is why early on in my practice I very quickly 
"discarded the technique of asking, "
“Who am I?  Who am I?  Who am I?” because straight 
away I saw that “Who am I?” 
was implying that ‘I’ was something or someone.  It
 was the wrong question to ask 
because implicit in that question was the assumptio
n that I was something.  I was not 
quite sure of what I was but it was something.  My 
way of developing insight into 
Metta
" was to ask myself, “What do I take myself to be?” "
" The question, “What do I "
take myself to be?” was seeing – in the realm of pe
"rception, cognition and view – "
"what I actually thought I was, what I believed I wa"
s.  I was uncovering layers and 
"layers of delusion and, as I watched this body, I s"
"aw how I thought about this body, "
how I viewed this body.  Sometimes it shocked me to
 see that after all these years of 
"practise, having read all of these things and havin"
g given talks about 
Metta
", I was still "
"taking this body to be ‘me’, to be ‘mine’, to be a "
‘self’. 
I noticed this whenever concern arose about the bod
"y, about its health, its longevity, "
24
about what it looked like.  If someone called me fa
t or if someone called me skinny or 
someone made jokes about me – about my race; about 
"my gender, about whatever – if "
that rattled me in the slightest it was because I s
till had a view of self towards this 
"body.  I still had perceptions, I still had thought"
s about this body being something to 
do with ‘me’ or ‘mine’ – especially if any pain occ
urred in the body or I started 
worrying about the safety of this body.  I was not 
willing to let this body go.  What 
"you attach to is what you won’t let go, what you ca"
"n’t let go, what you want to carry "
"on with, what you protect and what you control.  Al"
l of this is what comes about from 
the delusion of a ‘self’. 
"People sometimes think they aren’t afraid of death,"
" but when things are threatening, "
when they come face to face with a tiger or a cobra
", that is when they find out whether "
they are afraid of death or not.  In my early medit
ations I used to imagine myself in 
such situations with snakes or tigers.  I would see
"k out dangers, on the level of "
"imagination, to see if I really did think this body"
 was a ‘self’ or not.  I wanted to see 
how I actually related to this body and whether I t
ruly perceived or thought of it as 
‘self’.  The Buddha said that one should practise 
		
 on the body to know this 
body as it truly is:  know it to the extent that th
"is is just a body, it’s not ‘me’, it’s not "
"‘mine’, and it’s not a ‘self’. "
Picking up the Gold 
"It’s interesting, especially when we develop deep m"
"editation, to notice how random "
"perception is.  Why, of all of the available things"
" to be perceived, do we choose this "
and not the other?  We can see that we are creature
"s of habit, we perceive according to "
habit.  We perceive this way and not another way be
cause of so much habitual 
"conditioning.  Our race, our gender, our upbringing"
", our experiences all make us "
choose from ‘the shelf of available options’ just o
ne or two.  So often people choose 
the same options.  It is like going is going to a s
upermarket shelf where there are so 
many different sorts of breakfast cereal and yet ch
oosing the same one or two brands.  
"Every time we look at the mind or at the body, we a"
ccept the same perception and 
miss so much more.  That’s why deep 
samatha
" meditation, especially "
jhanas
", blows "
away those habits.  Instead of always taking the sa
"me breakfast cereal from the shelf, "
"in that simile, after the experience of "
jhanas
", we try others.  We see all the products on "
25
the shelf and we know how this whole thing works.  
Our mind is wide and deep and 
so powerful that we can do these things. 
Investigating perception is a wonderful way of deve
loping the wisdom that breaks the 
illusion of ‘self’.  It’s not only that we think an
d perceive as an ‘
I
"’, but we perceive in "
such a way that we sustain that delusion.  Basicall
"y, when we have the delusion of ‘I’ "
we want to keep it.  There is a simile in the 
%
"Sutta"
 (DN 23).  Two friends go to a 
deserted town looking for treasure and they find so
me hemp and decide to take it 
away.  On the way home one of the men finds some li
"nen, so he throws down the "
hemp and puts the linen on his head instead.  The o
"ther man, thinking he had gone to "
"all the trouble of making a well bound up bundle, d"
ecided to continue on with the 
"hemp.  Further on they found some copper, then some"
" silver, then some gold.  The "
man who had the hemp on his head said “This hemp is
" good enough for me”, but the "
other friend would always change what he had for th
at which was worth more.  When 
they got back home the one who brought back the gol
d was well received by his 
"friends and relations, but the man who only brought"
 back the hemp was driven from 
the village.  We’ve often had our perceptions for a
" long time and, because they’re well "
"‘bound up’, we carry ‘them on our head’ as if they "
were ours.  We refuse to let them 
go to pick up a new perception.  We’ve had these pe
"rceptions, especially the way we "
"look at the world, our views and the way we perceiv"
"e according to those views, for so "
long that we refuse to put them down and pick up th
e gold.  When we do insight 
"meditation based on deep states of tranquillity, we"
 have the ability to put down the old 
bundles of hemp we’ve been carrying around for life
times and pick up the gold. 
We need the quietness and stillness of the powerful
 mind experienced after 
jh

nas
 – 
the experience after the five hindrances are abando
ned – and then the mind can see 
things in a different way.  The mind is so still th
at it very easily breaks free from the 
old ways of looking and we get deeper and deeper.  
"Looking deeper means, as it were, "
"taking off those old wrappers, those old perception"
"s, old views, old ideas.  Uncovering "
"the Dhamma, which is wrapped in all our old conditi"
"oning, we get to levels that we’ve "
never seen before.  That’s basically what insight i
"s, seeing deeply into the nature of "
things to the point where it’s new; it’s something 
we haven’t uncovered before.  We 
"go deeper and deeper and deeper, until we find that"
 what we are seeing is exactly what 
26
is described in the 
suttas
.  It is what the Buddha and the 

 have been teaching 
us all along but which we had not accepted.  
","
" (body) is not ‘me’, not ‘mine’, not "
a ‘self’.  
+#
 (feeling) and 
Panna
" (perception) are not ‘me’, not ‘mine’, not a ‘self"
’.  
$
(mental 
formations) 
are 
not 
"‘me’, "
not 
"‘mine’, "
not 
a 
‘self’. 
+**
"(consciousness) is not ‘me’, not ‘mine’, not a ‘sel"
f’.  We go deeper into the 
$
", "
into thoughts and ideas. 
"How many people fight wars over ideas, over argumen"
ts on who is right and who’s 
"wrong? If we take all these thoughts, all these ide"
"as to be ours, then we’ll argue.  If we "
take them to be ours we will think there is a right
 and wrong there.  We should know 
that they are only thoughts and ideas; some are mor
e accurate than others because 
"they are pointing to reality, but they aren’t reali"
ty. 
Sometimes we should look at the thoughts and ideas 
that arise in our minds with the 
"tool of “What do I take to be ‘me’, to be ‘mine’, t"
o be ‘self’”.  Often we’ll be 
surprised at the thoughts or ideas we are taking to
" be ‘me’, to be ‘mine’, to be a ‘self’.  "
"This is who I am:  this is my thought, my idea, and"
 these are my views.  You can very 
easily define yourself by your thoughts and ideas. 
"Sometimes it’s good, if you think you are a Buddhis"
"t, to go and see a born-again "
Christian who challenges you.  Many years ago when 
I was staying in our old 
vih
ā
ra
"(dwelling place) in Perth with Ajahn Jagaro, there "
was a letter drop in our mail box 
from a local born-again Christian group.  They were
 giving a film presentation of the 
‘
Orange People Exposed’
", ‘"
Hinduism Exposed’
", ‘"
Buddhism Exposed’
", and strangely "
enough ‘
Iridology Exposed’
.  I don’t know what they had against iridology but
 that 
was also included.  Everyone was invited and I want
"ed to go, I asked Ajahn Jagaro, "
"“Can I go?  I would like a bit of fun”, but Ajahn J"
agaro wouldn’t let me.  I was 
"disappointed.  It would have been good fun, but it "
would also have been a test to see 
whether I would be rattled in the midst of so many 
people who had such completely 
"different views from me.  If one is rattled, if one"
" is upset or concerned, one sometimes "
"gets angry or irritated at a view, at an idea.  Why"
?  It’s because we are taking our own 
"views and ideas to be ‘me’, to be ‘mine’, to be a ‘"
self’.  We should look at these 
"things and ask, “What do I take to be ‘me’?” "
27
The Delusion of Freedom 
"‘That which does’, the ‘doer’, lies very deep insid"
e us.  I focus on this choice and 
freedom because it is a deep part of the delusion o
f self.  It is the reason our Western 
"world, in its delusion, fights for individual freed"
"oms, as if there were any individual "
"freedoms.  The freedom to choose, the freedom to be"
" in control of our affairs, is just a "
delusion.  How many people are really free in the W
est to choose what they want?  
How 
many 
people 
are 
completely 
in 
the 
power 
of 
adve
"rtisements, "
cultural 
"inducements, peer pressure, conditioning from their"
 youth or from their past lives?  
How many people are truly free?  The answer is only

.  The choices that we 
make and the decisions that we take are wonderful t
hings to focus on.  Watch yourself 
"choosing to move your legs, or choosing to scratch "
"yourself on the cheek, or choosing "
this word rather than that word.  What’s doing this
?  Where does this come from?  
Where does this originate?  What chooses?  Please n
"ever say ‘who’ chooses, because "
that implies a being in there somewhere.  What choo
ses?  Where does it arise?  To be 
"able to see that, you need a very quiet mind, a ver"
y peaceful mind. 
One of the problems people have when they try to do
 insight meditation and gain deep 
"insight, is not sustaining the attention for long e"
nough.  
If the mind can’t watch the 
"breath for five minutes without wandering away, how"
 can it ever sustain the attention 
on an object of insight long enough to really uncov
er it
?  Five minutes is not enough.  
"We have to watch the meditation object for hours, t"
o see it coming and going.  We 
have to sustain our attention long enough to gain e
nough data to suspend our old ideas 
and beliefs – long enough to see the truth.  In the
" simile of the lotus, the sun has to "
warm the petals of the lotus for long enough for th
e innermost petals to open up.  The 
mind has to sustain its attention for a long time o
n something like choice or intention 
(
#
) – one of the most important 
$
" – before you can fully understand it, "
comprehend it and see it for what it is.  
-#
 is conditioned.  We know 
#
 is 
conditioned because when we get into 
jhanas
#
 stops. 
Once you start to see 
#
" as being conditioned, it makes you doubt that it’s"
 you 
who is doing this and you also start to see exactly
 what 
#
" is.  Remember, I said "
that this is the delusion of a ‘self’.  
-#
 is real but we mistakenly take it to be a 
28
"‘self’, we add something to it that isn’t there.  I"
t’s just like a mirage:  it’s real light 
reaching your retina but we misunderstand it to be 
something else.  It is the same with 
this 
#
", the ‘doer’, or rather ‘that which does’, choice. "
 Look deeply at it again and 
again and you start to find out why you say these t
"hings, why you do these things "
repeatedly.  We do it because we did it before; we 
say it because we said it before.  
"Habits – because we got pleasure there before, the "
mind seeks pleasure there again.  
We finally see that we can’t stop this because it i
s conditioned.  It comes from beyond 
"us, beyond a ‘self’, beyond a ‘me’. "
"Sometimes people ask the question, and it’s a very "
"good question, “If "
#
 is 
"completely conditioned, how on earth can we stop it"
 and get enlightened?”  We can 
stop 
it 
because 
the 
Buddha 
existed 
and 
because 
we 
h
ave 
his 
teachings. 
That 
Enlightenment of the Buddha produces a condition to
 stop our 
#
.  Without the 
Enlightenment of the Buddha it would be nearly impo
ssible for us to create the 
intention ourselves to end 

.  Because of the conditioned nature of 
#
", if it "
"doesn’t get conditioned by the Buddha, it would jus"
"t go around and around, it would "
be self-sustaining.  It needs some external input t
"o break this cycle, and that comes "
from the 

", it comes from the Buddha. "
It’s interesting to watch 
#
.  I’ve mentioned to people some of the experiences
that I have had with 
#
", with my will.  Early on I really thought that I w"
as in 
control of this body and mind.  If I decided to do 
"something, I did it.  But one of the "
things that really rocked me in my early years was 
how much I was a creature of 
"habit, a creature of conditioning.  In the hippy er"
a I was a rebel.  I thought I was being 
"an individual, making my own choices.  That’s what "
"rebelliousness is all about, "
making your own choices rather than following what 
everyone else is doing.  Then I 
went to a rock festival and found that everyone els
e was dressed in the same way as 
"me, they had the same hairstyle with beards, beads,"
 and green velvet trousers.  I 
wasn’t the only one.  Maybe I was the only one with
 green velvet trousers in Acton 
but not on the Isle of Wight during the festival.  
I realized that I was just wearing a 
uniform and from that moment I started to see that 
"it was just a physical, external "
thing.  How much of your mind is just you wearing a
" uniform?  With your choices, "
"with your thoughts, you’re the same as everybody el"
"se, just like sheep.  I remember a "
29
monk telling me once that his father was a farmer a
nd he had worked on the farm.  
One day he found a whole line of sheep completely c
ircling a thicket of bushes in the 
middle of a field.  They couldn’t see to the other 
"side of the bushes, so they were all "
walking around in a circle.  He didn’t know how lon
g they had been there following 
"the one in front in an unbroken circle, but he susp"
ected that if he hadn’t broken the 
"circle they would still be there today, just walkin"
g around one following after the 
other. 
That’s a 
wonderful 
simile for 
our 
mind just
 following 
one 
thought 
after 
"another, one choice after another, round and round "

.  Being a farmer he 
managed to take hold of one of the sheep and pull i
"t out, breaking the line.  In that "
"simile, the farmer stands for the Buddha taking out"
 one bit of delusion to stop this 
whole circular process of conditioning. 
"Look at ‘that which does’ and ask yourself, is that"
 what you take yourself to be?  Is it 
important that you have the freedom to choose?  Are
 you afraid of being ‘brain 
washed’ and someone else taking over your choice?  
Are you afraid of surrendering to 
the 

 or the rules of the monastery?  Why?  Isn’t it tha
t you are taking the choice 
"to be yours?  You think you want to be independent,"
 but basically you are under the 
illusion that 
#
" is a ‘self’, a ‘me’ or ‘mine’. "
Why I Tell Silly Jokes 
I once had the opportunity to visit one of the 
"Arahants,"
 Taungpulu Sayadaw.  I was 
with some other monks in Bangkok and we heard that 
he was in town so we went to 
see him.  He was there and so we went up to chat wi
th him.  There was an interpreter 
present and the other two monks with me asked quest
"ions, silly questions I thought, so "
I asked the silliest question.  I only had the chan
ce to ask one question of this great 
"monk, Taungpulu Sayadaw.  I was cheeky enough to as"
"k him, “Who is answering "
"these questions”?  Taungpulu answered straightaway,"
 “

”.  Even though he only 
spoke Burmese I understood the 
Pali
 word 

":  Mind, that’s all.  It’s mind, just a "
"process, it’s not Taungpulu answering.  That really"
 hit me.  When you ask questions 
of these great monks they sometimes give answers th
at you don’t expect! 
So these are the things that I contemplate again an
d again and again.  We see that 
"there’s no one answering these questions, it’s just"

", just mind, not a thing, not a "
30
"person, just a process, ‘that which chooses’.   Loo"
k closely at choice because from 
"choice we get control.  Choice is attachment, contr"
ol is craving and it’s what creates 

.  You can’t be choice-less.  That was one of Krish
namurti’s many mistakes:  
"‘choice-less awareness’, he chose to be choice-less"
".  Choice is there, "
#
" exists, but "
we need to see its causes.  When we see where it co
"mes from, we realise it’s not "
"coming from ‘me’, it’s not coming from a ‘god’.  It"
"’s not coming from anything, it’s "
just cause and conditioning.  There are many reason
s why I talk like this.  If you want 
"to know why I tell silly jokes, it’s because my fat"
her used to tell silly jokes.  It’s 
"conditioned, so don’t blame me.  Once we start to s"
ee all of this we understand about 
$
" not being a ‘self’, not being ‘me’, or ‘mine’.  If"
 it’s not ours we can let it go.  
That’s the test to find out if we’ve truly seen 
Metta
. 
"If we’ve truly seen that this body is not ours, we "
"can let it go, we can let it die.  If "
someone comes along with a gun and they’re about to
" shoot us, if there’s no escape, "
"“Okay, let them shoot”.  We can be without fear bec"
ause we know this body is not 
ours.  In the same way if someone comes to steal ou
"r car and we can’t stop them, "
"“Okay, off you go, it’s not mine”.  It belongs to t"
he Buddhist Society and hopefully 
the insurance company will buy us a new one if it g
ets stolen.  If they don’t it doesn’t 
"matter, we just won’t go into Nollamara on a Friday"
 evening.  Great!  We should look 
upon our body in the same way as the monastery car 
– it’s convenient but we don’t 
own it. 
"Whatever it is, if we see that we are losing it and"
" we are afraid, or we can’t let it go, "
"that means we take it to be ours, there’s a ‘self’ "
in there somewhere.  Can we let go of 
choice?  Can we for example let the senior monk do 
all the choosing?  Why not?  Or 
"even deeper, can we stop choosing?  When you are me"
"ditating, can you let go of "
#
 when you’re practising 
samadhi
?
  What I’m asking is can you enter 
jhanas
?
  In 
a 
jhana
" choosing ceases, we’re not doing anything, the min"
d isn’t moving. 
Cetan
ā
" moves the mind, it wobbles the mind, it disturbs t"
he mind.  In 
jhanas
 the mind 
"is at ease, not moving; you can call it ‘choice-les"
s awareness’.  Choice-less awareness 
in 
jhanas
 is the moment where there is no choice.  There’s n
o new 
#
" appearing, "
just the old 
#
 from before the 
jhana
.  People sometimes pull me up on this and 
31
say that in the 
"
"
"Sutta"
" (MN 111, 4) Venerable "
"
"
 knew in first 
jhana
that 
#
 was there.  I gave a simile some years ago about w
here 
#
 fits into 
jhana
".  It’s like shooting an arrow, you aim and you let"
 it go.  The ‘aim’ is there; it 
exists throughout the arrows flight until it hits t
he target.  But once the arrow is shot 
from the bow it cannot change its course.  The 
#
" is fixed, the ‘aim’ is fixed, the "
‘aim’ you could say is carried with the arrow until
 it hits the target.  The same applies 
to 
jhanas
; you have 
#
", but once the "
jhana
 begins – the arrow has left the bow and 
"is flying, carrying that "
#
", but is unable to be changed until the flight of t"
hat mind 
state ends and the 
jhana
 breaks.  That’s how 
#
 exists within a 
jhana
:  it is 
"immovable, unable to be activated.  To see ‘that wh"
"ich does’ as not ‘me or mine’, not "
"‘self’, is enough to be able to let it go and be ab"
"le to abide without thinking, without "
"doing, allowing the process to stop. "
Ajahn Chah’s famous simile is of a leaf that only m
oves because of the wind blowing.  
The nature of the leaf is to be still.  Take away t
he wind and the leaf wobbles less and 
less until it comes to stillness.  Take away 
#
", which is the wind in that simile, and "
the mind wobbles less and less until it stops in 
jhana
.  That’s what the 
jhanas
" are, the "
mind stopping and not moving.  Those who still have
n’t seen the 
#
 as not-self 
will have a hard time with 
jhanas
".  Contemplate, give rise to insight into non-self,"
"‘that which does’, as not ‘me’, not ‘mine’, not ‘me"
’ doing these things.  I’m not 
"choosing these things.  Investigate that, until suc"
h time as you can see this 
#
 as 
"just a process; it’s got its causes, it’s got its e"
"ffects, and you see them all.  It’s not me! "
The Last Citadel 
"There is another place, which is the last citadel o"
"f the ‘self’.  The ‘self’ is in a castle, "
its own medieval castle.  Castles have a citadel or
" keep, the strongest part of the castle "
or fort with all the castle walls around it.  Outsi
de the walls are moats and defences.  
That’s what it’s like trying to come to the citadel
 of the ‘delusion of self’.  You go 
through barrier after barrier until you finally com
e to the heart where the delusion of 
‘self’ hangs out.  This is the last place and 
'
 will defend it almost to the death.  
That self is the ‘doer’ and even more so the ‘knowe
"r’, ‘that which knows’, ‘that which "
"experiences’, the "
**
", the "
citta
", whichever you like.  Do you take ‘that which "
experiences’ to be you?  Do you think it is ‘me’ be
"hind the eye when you’re seeing, or "

"‘me’ listening behind the ears, or ‘me’ inside the "
body feeling all these pleasures and 
pains through the sense of touch or ‘me’ experienci
ng the thoughts?  You have to 
"investigate this consciousness, the ‘knowing’, and "
"ask the question, “Do I take this to "
"be a ‘self’, to be ‘me’ or ‘mine’?” "
"The more you know and experience, the bigger the il"
lusion of ‘self’ becomes.  “I’ve 
"been there, I’ve done that.”  “I know all this; I’v"
e experienced all of that.”  See ‘that 
"which knows’ as not being ‘me’, not being ‘mine’, n"
ot being a ‘self’.  Test that 
understanding by seeing if you can let go of ‘knowi
"ng’, let go of experiencing.  When "
"you can put it down, that’s when you understand it’"
"s not ‘me’, not ‘mine’, not a "
‘self’”.  Can you put down seeing or thinking about
" seeing, hearing or thinking about "
"hearing, "
smelling 
or 
thinking 
about 
"smelling, "
tasti
ng 
or 
thinking 
about 
"tasting, "
touching or thinking about touching in your meditat
"ion, or does every sound disturb "
"you?  Or, as Ajahn Chah said, do you disturb every "
"sound?  If so, why?  It’s because "
you still take consciousness – here the consciousne
"ss of the five senses – to be yours, "
to be you.  I am hearing this; if I don’t hear this
 I disappear.  That’s the reason you 
won’t let go of experiencing this body.  If I don’t
 experience this body and everything 
"shuts down, then I don’t exist.  That’s why we can’"
t let go.  If we could understand 
"that consciousness, the mind knowing, is not ‘me’, "
"not ‘mine’, not a ‘self’, we could "
let it go.  That way we can get into 
jhanas
 easily.  This is nothing to do with ‘me’; 
"look at what you take to be a ‘self’, the ‘doer’ or"
 the ‘knower’. 
There will come a time especially after deep medita
tion when you look at all these 
five 

", especially the ‘doer’ and the ‘knower’, and you w"
ill see to the very 
"depths that there is not a person there, not a bein"
g; it doesn’t belong to you; it’s 
completely conditioned.  A very common simile for t
he 
jhanas
 is the simile of the 
lake.  When there are ripples on the surface there’
"s activity, the mind is not at peace.  "
When we are looking at the lake without any ripples
", when the surface is absolutely "
smooth without any movement or agitation either on 
"the surface or in the water, the "
mind is at peace.  Only then can we look into the w
ater and see to the very depths of 
the water.  If there is any movement it creates dis
"tortion in the water, the light gets "
"bent, and we can’t really see clearly what’s at the"
 bottom.  Sometimes mud is stirred 
"up at the bottom making it cloudy, but when that wa"
ter becomes absolutely still and 
33
"it’s been still for a long time, all the mud settle"
s and the water is crystal clear as a 
result of stillness.  We can then look into the wat
er and we can see clearly without 
"delusion, without things being bent and distorted. "
 We can see clearly right to the very 
bottom of that body of water.  Only after 
jhanas
 can we see clearly right into the 
"bottom of this mind, right into the bottom of ‘know"
ing’ and ‘doing’.  We can see that 
"there’s nothing there, just a process arising and p"
assing away. 
If you really see the process that delusion takes t
"o be ‘me’ or ‘mine’ or ‘self’, not only "
do you see the truth of 
Metta
 but you also understand how 

 works.  You see 
how the process is not a path with a heart; this is
 a path without any heart.  It might 
"not be very amenable to lay people, but the "
Metta
 path is a path without any heart 
whatsoever.  If you see that process you can unders
tand how it can generate future 
"births, how the process can go on and on.  People w"
ho understand 
Metta
 understand 
rebirth as well.  Being able to see 
Metta
" is to also understand Dependent Origination, "
"cause and effect, that process which people misunde"
"rstand to be a ‘self’, to be ‘me’, to "
be ‘mine’. 
Looking at all of these things in terms of what do 
"I take to be ‘self’, to be ‘me’, to be "
"‘mine’, seeing that these are the things in experie"
"nce that one takes to be a ‘self’, "
helps understand why one can’t let them go.  Just k
"nowing that much, focusing on that "
"and uncovering the delusion, having that still mind"
 so you can see right to the very 
"bottom of the lake, you see that there is no one th"
"ere, there’s nothing.  Knowing is just "
"a process of consciousness; no one is ‘doing’, it’s"
 just 
#
.  Then like 
.
 (Ud 
"1.10), you will know that in the seeing there is ju"
st seeing; there is no one doing the 
"seeing or choosing to do the seeing.  In hearing, s"
"melling, tasting, touching; there is "
"just hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching.  No "
"one is doing the touching, no one is "
experiencing the touching; it’s just consciousness 
"and mind objects, or mind activity.  "
"It’s not an ‘essential mind’, not an ‘original mind"
"’, it’s just a process.  When you see "
that you’ll be free. 
Be careful with ‘knowing’ or ‘doing’ because it’s a
lways as if you’re behind a screen 
and the world is outside.  It’s easy to see that th
"e world beyond is not ‘me’, not "
"‘mine’, not a ‘self’, but we also need to see the w"
orld inside.  It’s like following the 
34
"beam of a projector, not just looking at the screen"
" where the movie is, but looking "
"back at where this movie is coming from, and seeing"
 it’s just a machine making all 
"these illusory images of sight, sound, smells, tast"
"es, touches, "
thoughts 
and mind 
objects.  It’s just like a movie that’s all.  It’s 
"not real.  We add the reality to it, we "
make the ‘self’; we construct it through 
*
 (proliferation). 
"When we see all of that, tracing the thing to its s"
ource and seeing that it is completely 
"empty, then like B"
ā
hiya we can live not taking up anything in the worl
"d as a ‘self’, as "
"‘me’, or ‘mine’.  There comes the end of rebirth.  "
You know Stream Winning when 
you’ve seen how stupid you were for so many lifetim
es taking something to be a 
"‘self’, usually the ‘doer’ or the ‘knower’.  You’ve"
" seen that, you’ve uncovered it; you "
know the stupidity of it.  You know that it’s only 
a matter of time before perception 
and thought fall into place.  You know that 

 is doomed when through each of 
"these senses, each of these "

", you don’t even perceive or think for a moment "
"that these things are anything to do with a ‘self’,"
 or with ‘your’ mind.  You know it’s 
"just a process, that’s all. "
It becomes like the simile of a meteor circling aro
und the Solar System for so many 
"millions of years, so many hundreds of millions of "
"years, and then suddenly it strikes "
the atmosphere of the earth and goes out in a blaze
" of light.  That’s it, it’s finished, "
gone. 
Just 
as 
the 

: 
having 
gone 
around 

for 
"millions, "
tens 
of 
"millions, countless millions of times, until they m"
eet the 
Dhamma
.  They meet the 
Dhamma
 and go out in a brilliant blaze of teaching. 
You know that you cannot claim Stream Winner falsel
y.  If you tell another person 
that you’re a Stream Winner and it’s just boasting 
"and you don’t really believe it, it’s "
a 

 offence (the gravest offences proscribed by the mo
nastic rules of discipline) 
and you have to leave the monkhood for the rest of 
your life. 
So please focus on the contemplation of 
Metta
".  What do I take to be ‘me’, to be "
"‘mine’, to be a ‘self’ in terms of the five "

" and the six senses, not as an "
intellectual exercise but as a tool to uncover thin
gs you’ve yet to see as a monk.

3  DETOXIFYING THE MIND 
2
nd
 of February 2000 
"The ordination ceremony, bringing into being two ne"
w 
"!
"
", that we performed "
here on Sunday afternoon is fresh in my mind.  Part
 of that ordination ceremony is a 
little chant which the 
"
"
 (preceptor) performs at the very end of the ordina
tion.  
"It is a very lovely chant, an exposition of the "
Dhamma
","
" the teachings of the Buddha, "
on the four things never to be done and the four re
sources or supports of a monk.  
That chant in 
Pali
" is one of my favourites, and it’s a shame I only d"
o it once a year.  It 
reminds me of the four resources for the basic life
 style of a Buddhist monk:  alms 
"food, lodging at the root of a tree, robes made of "
"rags, and just simple medicine made "
from fermented urine.  The simplicity of those four
" requisites always inspires me, "
even though we don’t live like that in this monaste
"ry.  Nevertheless, it does tell us "
what the original simplicity of monastic life was a
"ll about and, when we hear such "
"teachings, "
it 
encourages 
us 
to 
lean 
towards 
that 
si
"mplicity, "
rather 
than 
inclining 
towards abundance and having many possessions. 
"The way of the world is to have many possessions, t"
he more possessions the better.  
They may be convenient but usually they become a nu
isance.  We’re always falling 
"over things, preparing things, and maintaining thin"
gs.  The simplicity of the monastic 
life in the time of the Buddha is something which i
s worth bearing in mind.  It’s a 
simplicity that gives rise to freedom.  The more th
ings we have the more complicated 
"our life is, and the less we experience the beautif"
ul spaces that we call freedom.  At 
the very end of the ordination ceremony the Buddha 
gave a very powerful and very 
beautiful 
Dhamma
 teaching for the new monks.  I will focus this eve
ning’s talk on 
those verses. 
The Path 
There were many different ways that the Buddha taug
ht the 
Dhamma
.  
 
" (virtue), "
samadhi
" (concentration),"
and 
Panna
 (wisdom) have all been perfectly expounded.  
Making them the perfect exposition means we don’t r
eally need to look very much 
further than the Buddha’s description of the practi
ce of 
 
","
samadhi
 and 
Panna
.  This 
is the path of Buddhism:  to have perfect ethical c
"onduct, perfect concentration in "
"meditation, and perfect wisdom. "
36
Sometimes when we talk about 
 
","
samadhi
 and 
Panna
" in that way – about virtue, "
meditation and wisdom – people mistake the root mea
ning of those terms.  
 
 is all 
"about letting go, abandoning those tendencies of bo"
dily speech and bodily action that 
"are based upon things like craving, sensuality, ang"
"er, pride and jealousy.  All of the "
things that arise out of the negative emotions are 
cut off by the practice of 
 
.
  In the 
beginning the practice of 
 
" may tend to make you feel that you are confined, "
because you cannot express yourself as you used to 
be able to.  But really what you 
are 
doing 
is 
confining 
the 
defilements 
and 
the 
crav
ings 
in 
the 
mind. 
You’re 
disciplining them and putting them in jail in order
 to and destroy many of those 
negative emotions of the mind which create so many 
problems for yourself and for 
others.  The practice of 
 
" is no more than letting go of sensory desire, ill "
will and 
delusion.  It’s letting go of the coarser manifesta
tions of those things. 
When the Buddha talked about meditation he talked a
bout deepening the practice of 
letting go.  Anyone who has practised meditation wi
ll know that there are many 
obstacles to the quiet mind.  And those obstacles a
re only overcome through this 
"aspect, or this movement of the mind, that we call "
letting go.  All the cravings and 
desires come from a sense of ‘self’ trying to contr
"ol the world, trying to manipulate "
the world in order to seek illusory happiness that 
it thinks it can manufacture and 
keep.  It’s the basic delusion of human beings and 
of all other beings in the cosmos.  
"All beings think they can manufacture, attain and k"
eep happiness.  All beings tend to 
"reach out for happiness, but it’s always just a lit"
tle bit ahead of them.  We hang on to 
the hope that one day we may be able to find this i
llusive happiness ‘out there’ 
somewhere. 
That 
is 
the 
illusion 
that 
keeps 
the 
min
d 
"thinking, "
keeps 
the 
mind 
planning.  We keep the mind going out into the worl
"d, rather than stopping the mind "
"thinking, calming the mind and keeping it in here i"
nside. 
The Buddha perfectly expounded 
samadhi
", the deep teaching on meditation.  "
Samadhi
"is all encompassing, so powerful, it goes deeply in"
to the ‘letting go’ states of the 
"mind, into states that are far beyond the world.  T"
he 
jhana
 states are so different from 
the way consciousness reacts to the world.  

" states change from one to the other, "
into 
what 
are 
called 
the 

jhanas
: 
states 
of 
infinite 
"space, "
of 
infinite 
37
consciousness 
– 
or 
as 
I 
would 
prefer 
to 
"say, "
unboun
ded 
"space, "
unbounded 
"consciousness, the space of nothingness, neither pe"
rception nor non-perception. 
All these things are so refined and yet they are no
 more than stages of ‘letting go’.  
They 
are 
the 
results 
of 
abandoning 
things 
temporari
ly. 
As 
 
", "
or 
"virtue, "
is 
"abandoning the coarse, so "
samadhi
 is abandoning the refined.  The more we let go the
more peace there is in the mind.  The more profundi
"ty there is in the mind, the closer "
one gets to that which is truly the goal of religio
"n, just truth and otherworldly reality, "
that which is profound.  We’re going to the root of
" things, getting to the heart of the "
things that make this world tick.  By going to the 
root of things you get perfect 
"understanding, perfect wisdom.  That perfect unders"
tanding differs from the letting go 
of 
samadhi
","
" of meditation, because the letting go done in "
samadhi
 is only temporary.  
But when we come out of 
samadhi
", we come out with wisdom.  We are cutting off the "
"negative qualities of mind, such as greed, sensory "
"desire; lust; anger, ill will, pride, "
"jealousy, and fear.  We’re cutting all these off on"
ce and for all.  Gone forever! 
It’s strange that in the world people think that lu
st is good.  They sometimes even 
think that anger is good.  They never imagine there
 could be a state where one can 
exist without these things.  People very often thin
k the best that can be done is to 
repress or suppress these movements of the mind.  B
ut people who have trodden the 
path of the Buddha know that one can live in this w
"orld without lust, without any "
"anger, without any fear, without any pride, and wit"
hout any ill will towards other 
"living beings, no matter what they do to you.  This"
" becomes a very inspiring state, "
which truly deserves the word ‘saintliness’.  The w
ord saint actually comes from the 
Pali
 word 

", which means calm, peaceful.  Peacefulness is the "
result of ‘that which 
moves the mind’ being abandoned.  When ‘that which 
moves and shakes the mind’ is 
"abandoned, "
there 
is 
only 
the 
natural 
"peacefulness, "
not forced 
but coming 
as 
the 
automatic response to the abandonment of anything t
hat can move the mind.  The 
"mind is truly unshaken and unshakable, and only suc"
h a person truly deserves the title 
"of saint, or peaceful one. "
As 
the 
Buddha 
perfectly 
"explained, "
the 
threefold 
pr
actice 
of 
Buddhism 
is 
 
", "
samadhi
 and 
Panna
" – virtue, meditation and wisdom.  The focus of thi"
s practice is not 
38
just what you do but why you do it.  So often for e
"xample, when I give you a task to "
"do in the morning work period, if I explain why you"
 are doing it and what the purpose 
"of it is, it makes it so much easier to do a good j"
ob.  It’s important in the practice of a 
"Buddhist monk, not just to know what you are suppos"
"ed to do, but to know why you "
are doing it.  That illustrates and makes quite cle
ar just how you are supposed to live 
"this life, what the purpose is, and why.  One of my"
 favourite passages is not just in the 
"ordination chant, but is scattered throughout the "
"suttas"
" and the Vinaya Pitaka, repeated "
by the Lord Buddha many times on different occasion
s.  The Buddha said that this 
whole triple practice of 
 
", "
samadhi
", and "
Panna
", which is just a summarization of the "
Eightfold Path is to overcome the intoxications of 
"the mind.  It’s a beautiful phrase, "
the intoxications of the mind. 
Overcoming Intoxications 
Some people in the world love to be intoxicated.  N
ot just through substances like 
"alcohol or drugs, but also by the beauty of a membe"
r of the opposite sex.  Intoxicated 
"by the pleasure of a beautiful symphony, or intoxic"
ated by the beauty of a sunset.  The 
"Buddha said we should abandon all intoxication, bec"
"ause as the very name suggests, it "
means you are bringing toxins into the body – you a
re intoxicating yourself.  These 
"are the poisons of the mind.  What does it mean, ‘p"
oisoning the mind’?  It means 
bringing the mind to a sense of suffering and disea
"se; this is the lack of ease, the lack "
of peace in the mind.  Whenever you become intoxica
ted there is always a hangover 
afterwards and 
it’s in 
the 
hangover 
of 
intoxication
where 
we 
can 
really 
see 
the 
suffering of these things.  When there is a beautif
"ul relationship it must end one day, "
but the more you are intoxicated by that relationsh
"ip, the more severe the hangover "
"will be.  The more you enjoyed the beautiful music,"
 the harder you will feel its loss 
when it ends.  Each of these things the Buddha said
 are intoxications of the mind.  To 
overcome those intoxications one needs a sense of p
"eace and stillness, the happiness "
of which far exceeds the exhilaration of the five-s
ense world. 
This peace and stillness far exceeds any of the hap
piness of the world.  That’s why I 
keep 
on 
pressing 
the 
point 
for 
"monks, "
"novices, "
&
and 
visitors 
to 
the 
"monastery, to deeply experience the stages of ‘lett"
ing go meditation’.  This is not just 
disengaging from the world because of ill will towa
rds the pleasures of the world.  It 
39
is letting go of the pleasures of the world for som
"ething which is more pleasurable, "
more refined.  The great bliss of the mind in deep 
"meditation, the shear pleasure of "
"stillness, is something to be experienced, somethin"
g to be fully appreciated.  The 
Buddha said the whole purpose of practice is to aba
ndon those intoxicants which blind 
you to the pleasure of peace and stop you experienc
ing the pleasures of silence and 
stillness. 
Intoxication is always wanting to go back to get an
other hit of the drug of the five-
sense 
"worlds, "
wanting 
to 
see 
more 
"things, "
experienc
e 
more 
"things, "
have 
more 
"relationships, more pleasure.  That intoxication wi"
th the world is something which is a 
"great problem for humanity, because it stops you ap"
preciating something far more 
profound.  The whole purpose of this threefold prac
tice is to stop that intoxication.  It 
also gives a good explanation for the precept to ab
"andon alcohol, which is why monks "
don’t 
go 
partying 
or 
have 
a 
glass 
of 
champagne 
at 
t
he 
ordination 
ceremony 
to 
celebrate.  Instead of celebrating with intoxicants
 we celebrate with mindfulness. 
Intoxicants tend to mess up one’s awareness and dul
l the mind.  Pleasures lead to 
"dullness.  Once one realizes that, instead of intox"
icating the mind and having dullness 
"afterwards – that lack of clarity, almost ill will,"
 the sense of being upset – we develop 
the even mindedness that can still be happy in a di
"fferent sense, a more stable sense.  "
The 
Buddha 
said 
mindfulness 
is 
for 
overcoming 
intox
"ications, "
but 
not 
just 
the 
"intoxication for sensory pleasure, but even the int"
oxication with ‘self’.  There are 
different types of 

", or intoxication, which is a word that is sometime"
s translated 
"as pride, just like, pride in youth, pride in healt"
h and pride in being alive.  For those of 
you who are not yet old and have the intoxication o
"f youth, you think you’ll have this "
energy for ever.  But as soon as you start aging th
"e energy starts to disappear, you just "
can’t lift that axe as high as you did before.  You
 can’t drive it into the wood as 
deeply as you could before.  The body just will not
 do what you tell it. 
That’s a great insight and a great shock for some p
eople who are attached to their 
body. You see how in later life the body lets you d
own.  Instead of being something 
"that you can tell what to do, like an instrument of"
" your will, it just goes its own way; it "
just will not do things.  That’s a powerful thing t
o see for oneself in old age.  One 
doesn’t really believe that until one experiences i
t.  I can appreciate that for old people 
40
the body is a prison and it’s a very hard prison.  
"It just will not do what you tell it, "
instead it tells you what to do.  When the body wan
"ts to sleep, it just sleeps.  When it "
"wants to hurt, it just hurts, and you can’t do anyt"
hing about it.  The pride of the 
intoxication of youth is something to be wary of. 
The intoxication of health is similar to the intoxi
cation of youth.  To think that one is 
"so clever and smart for being healthy, and therefor"
e somehow superior.  “If people are 
ill it’s their own fault.”  Some people in our soci
ety think like that.  But we know that 
"health, and ill health are a pair and both are our "
inheritance.  When we look upon our 
"inheritance, which is given to us by our parents, w"
hat they have really given to us is 
"this body which is going to age, get sick and event"
ually die.  We get all the fun and 
the pleasures at the beginning and we pay for it at
 the end.  It’s not a very good deal! 
"There is also the intoxication of ‘being’, the into"
"xication of life.  People love to ‘be’, "
but why?  If we look at life and the suffering in l
"ife, we often think it is other people’s "
fault that they suffer.  In the same way we think i
t’s their fault that they get ill.  
Suffering is as natural to life as illness is; it’s
 no one’s fault it just comes.  We are 
genetically disposed to suffering and there is no w
ay you can manipulate those genes 
to avoid that suffering.  It’s just ‘par for the co
"urse’, it has to happen.  That is why the "
"Buddha said, “Separation from what you want is suff"
"ering, and being with what you "
don’t want is suffering”.  Half of life is being wi
"th what you don’t want, you can’t "
really avoid it.  But the Buddha said that the ‘pra
ctice’ is for the overcoming of the 
"intoxications and pride, and for the overcoming of "
"thirst, or rather the disciplining of "
craving. 
"Using the metaphor of thirst, one can actually unde"
rstand what the Buddha meant by 
craving; 
tanha
 is the 
Pali
 word for thirst.  It is as if one is dehydrated an
d always 
"wanting to drink, one has to get a drink.  That is "
"craving, which is in fact physical "
suffering.  We think our thirst can only be overcom
e once we’ve got the glass of water 
"or cup of tea, but as soon as we’ve had one glass o"
f water we need another one.  
That’s the trouble with thirst; we think that we ca
n overcome thirst by feeding it.  
"There are some thirsts that you have to feed, but m"
any thirsts can never be overcome 
by feeding them.  The only way you overcome the pro
blem is by disciplining the 
"thirst.  The more you give in to the mind, the more"
 it wants.  That’s why you can 
41
never overcome thirst in that way.  The thirst I am
" talking about is for pleasure, and "
sexuality. 
The Buddha once said there are three things you can
" never get enough of, never find "
"fulfilment in, and never satiate yourself with.  If"
" I remember it correctly, one was sex, "
"one was sleep, and the other was alcohol.  With tho"
se three things we always want 
some more.  This is why thirst can never be overcom
"e, can never be ended.  Look "
"upon the way craving works, craving is suffering.  "
As soon as craving manifests in the 
"mind, as soon as we want something, there’s a probl"
em.  There’s business to be done.  
"We have to aspire towards that thing, move towards "
"that thing, try and grab that thing.  "
"If we succeed in gaining what we crave for, does th"
e craving end for a little while?  If 
"we don’t get it we’re suffering.  With craving, wit"
"h these thirsts, as soon as we’ve got "
one thing we need something else.  That’s why these
 sorts of cravings for objects are 
"unfaithful to you; as soon as you have it, it does "
not satisfy you.  You want something 
else.  Craving promises that as soon as we get this
" thing we’ll be happy, but as soon as "
"we get it we want something else, that’s the way of"
" craving, the way of thirst.  You "
"can understand what it’s like to be thirsty, always"
" being thirsty, and then to have a "
"glass of water, and in a few moments you’re thirsty"
 again. 
Buddhist cosmology has beings called the 
#
".  These beings are ghosts, unfortunate "
beings who because of some past 
kamma
 in their previous lives have been born into 
that state.  They have very small mouths and very b
"ig stomachs, which means they "
can never eat enough and they are always hungry and
 thirsty.  You can imagine a 
"huge stomach needs a lot of food to fill it up, but"
 with such tiny mouths they can 
"never get enough.  Imagine that sort of suffering, "
"never being able to get enough, "
always being hungry and thirsty.  This is the state
" of human beings, always thirsty for "
"sensory pleasures, for objects, always hungry for e"
"xperiences, never truly being at "
peace.  That thirst has to be disciplined through t
he practise of 
 
", "
samadhi
 and 
Panna
", through virtuous practice leading to the ability "
to say no to the cravings in the 
mind.  It’s marvellous to see the practise of 
 
", of restraint, practiced over many "
years. 
The 
result 
is 
that 
one 
doesn’t 
need 
"sex, "
an
d 
one 
doesn’t 
need 
all 
the 
experiences that are on offer in the world.  One is
 quite happy without these things.  
42
It’s such a release and a relief to know that one c
an be happy without all of these 
difficult and dangerous things that are so fraught 
with problems and suffering. 
Someone told me some years ago that the root meanin
g of marriage comes from a 
Latin word meaning to take a gamble?  I don’t know 
"if that is true, but marriage is "
truly a gamble.  You never know really who you are 
marrying until maybe years after 
the ceremony.  We can understand that sensuality is
 fraught with danger and by 
overcoming it and restraining ourselves we’re freei
ng ourselves from that.  We are 
actually disciplining thirst.  If we don’t drink th
e thirst disappears.  A good example 
of this is sitting in meditation.  When we first si
t in meditation we try to get ourselves 
"comfortable, but for people just beginning meditati"
on it’s difficult to get comfortable 
for very long.  They have to sit this way or sit th
"at way.  They keep on fidgeting, "
always trying to find the most comfortable position
.  Usually they discover that if they 
"keep following that thirst of the body for comfort,"
 they will never find peace.  Instead 
of 
all 
this 
moving 
whenever 
there’s 
"discomfort, "
the
y 
find 
if 
they 
say 
no 
to 
the 
"demands of the body, discipline the demands of the "
"body and just sit still, the aches "
and itches disappear by themselves.  It seems that 
by not heeding them they fade 
away.  Scratching just makes more itches. 
This is what we mean by disciplining the thirst of 
the body.  By not following the 
demands of the body they disappear.  It’s just like
 some person knocking on the door 
of your house.  If you answer the door you may get 
"into a long conversation, and now "
"they know you are in, they will come again.  If you"
 don’t answer the door they’ll think 
"there is no one there, and they will go away never "
to return.  This is the way we 
discipline the body.  When you sit there long enoug
h and say no to all the itches and 
"aches of the body, and simply don’t move, the mind "
turns away from the feelings of 
the body.  For the first time you can sit still and
" in comfort.  It’s a strange thing, but if "
"we try and find comfort in the body by scratching, "
"by moving, by putting another "
"cushion underneath the bottom, we never find that c"
omfort.  Just leave the body alone.  
If we don’t answer the calls of scratching and movi
"ng, the body just disappears and "
then there is peace.  This is what we mean by disci
plining the thirsts.  By following 
and indulging them they just get worse.  By saying 
"no to them they disappear, and "
then we have comfort.

Use the triple practice of 
sãla
", "
samadhi
", and "
Panna
 to destroy 
 
.  My favourite 
translation of that 
Pali
 word 
 
 is roosting.  Many people translate this word as 
attachment but that doesn’t actually give the full 
meaning.  The roost is a place where 
"birds go at night time, up in the trees where they "
will be safe from predators.  The 
Buddha 
said 
to 
destroy 
those 
"roosts, "
those 
places 
w
here 
we 
sit 
and 
allow 
the 
defilements of the mind to grow and allow the world
 to grow around us.  Destroy 
those attachments of the mind.  The Buddha said tha
t 
 
", "
samadhi
 and 
Panna
 will 
destroy these things.  People often say they like t
o put down roots.  But whenever they 
put down roots in the world those trees will always
 fall over whenever there is a 
"storm, whenever there is a strong wind.  The aim in"
 Buddhism is not to have such 
roots but to be able to flow freely from one place 
to another – to be like a bird or a 
"balloon in the sky, never tethered anywhere, with n"
"o weight, being able to float higher "
"and higher, and having no roosting places.  That is"
 what we mean by freedom. 
The person who is tied down lives in a prison.  Man
y people make prisons of their 
lives; they make the bars of their prisons with the
 possessions they own.  The prison 
guards are the relationships that confine and very 
often torture us.  What the Buddha 
is saying is that we can let go of all of these pri
"sons, all of these roosts, we can "
abandon them.  We can free ourselves from confineme
nt.  People who meditate and 
"who live monastic lives experience a great freedom,"
 even though they sometimes stay 
in one place and don’t move.  People may say that’s
 attachment.  “Why are you fixed 
"at being in this one place, in this one monastery?”"
"  And you say, “Because there is "
"nothing to blow me away”.  That’s real freedom, not"
 external freedom but internal 
"freedom, where there is nothing to blow you from on"
e place to another.  There are no 
"defilements, there is no craving, and there are no "
roosting places.  Birds go from one 
"branch to another branch, always finding a differen"
"t roosting place, but that’s not what "
the Buddha meant by ‘no roosts’.  He meant having n
"owhere at all, and carrying on to "
destroy round of rebirth.  So this practice of 
 
", "
samadhi
 and 
Panna
", the factors of the "
"Eightfold Path, not only destroys the roosts but al"
so destroys rebirth. 
Here in a deeper sense we can see the connection be
tween the roosts and rebirth.  
"Where the mind roosts there it grows, where the min"
d grows there it seeks rebirth.  
This is the powerful teaching of how the mind goes 
from one life to another according 
44
"to its predilections, its cravings, and its inclina"
tions.  
"What you want, you will become"
.  
This is a very powerful teaching because we can see
 that if we incline towards or any 
"aspire for sensory pleasure, and we really work for"
" it, eventually we will get there, if "
not in this life then in the next one.  This is the
 problem for human beings.  
We are 
actually creating the world
.  We are creating our next lives by the roosts tha
t we have.  
"If we roost in pride, if we want to be someone, if "
"we want to be respected, we will "
seek that in a future life as well.  Our will creat
"es these worlds for us and eventually, "
"when we do gain that fame, we will realize just wha"
t an empty thing it is.  All those 
people who have gained fame after working so hard f
or so long wonder why they took 
so much trouble.  All those people who have experie
nced wealth after so much hard 
work 
wonder 
what 
it 
was 
all 
for. 
And 
even 
those 
pe
ople 
who 
experience 
"relationships, the very highs of love and intimacy,"
" afterwards, when it vanishes so "
"quickly, they wonder why it was all just false prom"
ises.  But we build up our hopes 
thinking that the next relationship will be okay. 
When the Wind Dies Down 
We are reborn to experience our hopes and our aspir
ations and eventually we create a 
world so we can experience those things.  I remembe
r Ajahn Jagaro’s famous story 
from the Mullah Nasrudin.  This little man was in f
ront of a pot of chilli peppers with 
"tears streaming down his face, his face was red fro"
m eating so much chilli.  Someone 
"came by and asked him, “Why are you eating all thos"
"e hot chillies?”, and he said “I’m "
"looking for the sweet one”.  All the hot chillies, "
all the pain and suffering he was 
"experiencing, one chilli after another chilli after"
" another chilli, suffering and burning "
because he was looking for the sweet one.  It’s a v
ery good metaphor for life.  People 
get reborn because they are still looking for the s
weet chilli.  The way of 
 
samadhi
and 
Panna
 is letting go.  Letting go through the practice of
 virtue and letting go further 
through the practice of 
samadhi
 we realize we don’t need any more chillies.  By 
letting go of the movement of the mind that seeks f
"or more, there we find the "
"sweetness.  The sweetness is non-desire, non-cravin"
"g, the sweetness of not moving "
outside 
"ourselves, "
the 
sweetness 
of 
being 
"still, "
pe
"aceful, "
and 
free. 
Once 
you 
understand that sweetness you’ll have cut off the v
"ery cause of rebirth – the craving, "
"the hope, the desire – that’s why this path actuall"
"y ends rebirth.  That thirst, that "
"craving, the force behind rebirth, the ‘house build"
"er’, has created our lives, one life "
45
"after another, hundreds, thousands of lifetimes, an"
"d that very force of movement, that "
"craving, has been seen and cut off. "
"We know the cravings, but this practice ends all of"
 those cravings that cause so many 
problems to the human mind.  The monks who have jus
"t joined this monastery, who "
"just ordained last Sunday, want to be peaceful.  Bu"
t during your monastic life many 
"cravings will come up, many desires, many sensory a"
"spirations, and all of those will "
torture you.  What we aspire towards can only be ac
hieved when we discipline and 
kill 
the 
cravings. 
Only 
through 
the 
practice 
of 
 
", "
samadhi
 and 
Panna
do 
the 
cravings come to an end.  Only then can we be free 
of these things.  Craving is the 
"great tyrant of human beings, animals and all other"
 beings.  It’s a tyrant because it 
leads us by the nose.  We are imprisoned; we are fe
ttered by craving in this world of 
"ours, in this present stage of the world. "
Actually it’s absolutely crazy that we take the abi
"lity to follow our cravings, to "
experience what we want as freedom.  We think that 
"is going to give us peace, give us "
"freedom, but the more that we give free reign to cr"
"aving, the more imprisoned we feel.  "
"The more we indulge, the more we need to indulge"
".  We become prisoners, fettered by "
"craving, fettered by attachment.  We’re fixed to th"
ese things and we cannot be free.  If 
we only go to expensive restaurants we can never en
joy eating at home again.  We can 
never get a ‘McDonalds’ or anything else that is si
mple.  We always have to get the 
finest food.  We’re stuck with these things.  We’ve
 been sucked in.  This is why there 
is no freedom to be found by following craving.  
Craving is the tyrant
.  Craving is the 
very cruel prison guard who always tortures us. 
 It
’s only when that 
craving is 
overcome that there is a sense of freedom.  Instead
" of having to buy this, instead of "
"having to go there, instead of having to indulge, w"
e’ve got complete freedom.  People 
"sometimes go to the shops and say, “I just had to b"
"uy that!”  Or, even though they are "
"already happily married, they meet and are attracte"
d to someone else.  They have to 
"hurt their partner and children, as they indulge th"
eir desires with someone else.  Or we 
see food that we really like and even though it’s b
ad for our health we have to eat it. 
Why is it that our cravings are so strong that they
 kill us and create so much suffering 
in the world?  It is only when there is the destruc
tion of craving that there can be true 
"freedom, true peace.  The path of meditation is exp"
eriencing this for yourself.  We 
46
never get a peaceful meditation when we follow crav
ing.  The Five Hindrances are all 
"about craving.  Disciplining those five hindrances,"
" overcoming them, letting them go "
"means there’s no craving in the mind, the mind is s"
till.  Craving is what moves the 
"mind, what agitates the mind; it’s the wind which m"
akes the mind move.  When the 
"craving disappears, when the wind dies down, when i"
"t’s absolutely still, then you are "
still and in that stillness is peace.  In that peac
e is contentment.  In that contentment is 
"happiness.  So, this is what we always aim and aspi"
"re for, the overcoming of that "
craving rather than indulging it. 
From the overcoming of craving comes 
&
", dispassion or fading away.  I like both "
of those translations because they are both the mea
ning of 
&
.  
+&
 leads to the 
fading away of things rather than the accumulating 
of things.  It’s nice just to fade 
"away, to disappear, and to go off into nothingness,"
 into emptiness.  People in the 
"world want to ‘be’, they want to exist.  But Buddhi"
"st monks want to disappear, to fade "
"away, and to cease.  Where there is dispassion, the"
re is a lack of passionate concern 
for the sensory world.  You fade away from that wor
ld.  You fade away from the 
"kitchen, from the office, and you fade away into yo"
"ur huts.  People don’t see you, they "
don’t 
hear 
"you, "
and 
the 
good 
monks 
are 
those 
monks 
who 
are 
invisible 
in 
the 
"community, the ones who are already fading away so "
much you hardly ever see them.  
That’s 
what 
fading 
away 
means 
and 
the 
fading 
away 
e
ventually 
leads 
to 
true 
cessation. 

 is one of the most beautiful of 
Pali
 words; it is where all of the defilements 
"come to a complete end, where craving comes to an e"
"nd, where suffering comes to an "
end.  
!!
" – the flame has gone out, the fire is quelled.  So"
", this is actually what "
"we are saying in the ordination chant, how this thr"
ee-fold practise of 
 
", "
samadhi
 and 
Panna
 leads to all these beautiful things.  The Buddha m
entioned this because he 
"wanted the old monks, the young monks, and the visi"
tors to know the purpose of this 
"monastic life, and where it’s leading.  One of the "
reasons people find it difficult to 
meditate is not because they haven’t trained enough
", or haven’t been on enough "
"retreats, it is because their practice of virtue is"
n’t strong enough.  That doesn’t just 
mean keeping rules; it means there is too much crav
"ing, too much attachment to the "
world.  So despite their best wishes they cannot ke
"ep the precepts, because there’s too "
47
much fire in their minds.  This is where we all nee
d to discipline ourselves with 
 
", "
virtuous conduct.  It’s a strange thing but as peop
"le join a place like this monastery, as "
they become 
&
", novices and monks, they find that just keeping th"
e practice 
"of the precepts, keeping good "
 
", actually leads to a peaceful mind and it makes it"
easier to meditate.  If you’re keeping the precepts
" the mind is easier to concentrate, "
and so it’s easier to let go.  When you let go of o
ne thing it’s easier to let go of others.  
If you have a very well developed practice of 
 
 then 
samadhi
" is a great fruit, and a "
great benefit.  If you’ve got really good 
 
", then "
samadhi
 has the fruit of 
jhanas
", the "
benefit of deep peace and the beautiful happiness o
f bliss. 
When wisdom is founded on 
samadhi
" then that too is a great fruit, a great benefit.  "
Wisdom not based on 
samadhi
", not based upon "
jhanas
","
 not based on those peaceful 
"states of mind is not of great fruit, is not of gre"
at benefit.  There are many wise people 
in this world but it is not a wisdom based on 
samadhi
.  There are many people in the 
"universities, many smart people in business, many s"
"lick lawyers, but their "
Panna
", their "
"wisdom, because it’s not based on "
samadhi
" is not of really great fruit, of great benefit, "
and more importantly is not certain to lead to happ
"iness.  If it is wisdom, deep "
"understanding, based on those stages of "
samadhi
", the Buddha said it is of great fruit, "
of great benefit.  It’s the wisdom that sees the pa
th to ending suffering.  Not following 
"defilements, not following craving but disciplining"
", quelling, overcoming craving, and "
"letting go of the source, this is what wisdom sees."
  Wisdom sees that craving is the 
cause for rebirth.  Wisdom sees that the happiness 
one aspires towards is not found 
"out there but lives inside.  By letting go, by bein"
"g still, by being at peace, by being "
"content, not arguing with the world but just lettin"
"g the world disappear, that sort of "
wisdom is based on 
samadhi
. 
It is said that a mind which is endowed with such w
"isdom, a mind which is founded "
on 
"wisdom, "
overcomes 
the 
asava
", "
the 
out-flowings 
of 
the 
mind. 
"Namely, "
that 
"tendency to go seeking for sensory pleasures, that "
tendency to go seeking for more 
"existence, "
bhavasava
", and that tendency to go out based on delusion, th"
e 
avijjassava
.  
These three things are abandoned in a mind that is 
founded on the wisdom which is 
founded on 
samadhi
", which is founded on "
 
.  This is the powerful teaching of the 
Buddha telling us the way to overcome the defilemen
"ts, to overcome these "
out-
48
"flowings, telling us what makes us move, what makes"
" us suffer, what takes us out of "
the inner happiness which is right there if we can 
only be content. 
In Conclusion 
"So the Buddha said that each one of you, especially"
" new monks, should practice "
"assiduously, diligently, in the "
 
", higher morality, "
citta
", concentration of "
"mind, and "
Panna

he 
 
for monks are the 
%
 Precepts of the 
+
 together with sense restraint.   
The precepts which you have undertaken should never
" be seen as burdens, but they "
should be seen as vehicles which take you to freedo
m.  The 
citta
 training is the 
training in 
jhanas
 nothing less.  And the 
Panna
 is the wisdom which leads to the 
"Enlightenment stages of Stream Winner, Once Returne"
"r, Non Returner and "

.  
Train yourselves in these things. 
In the ordination procedure the Buddha not only tau
ght the young monks to be simple 
and to watch out to not transgress these major rule
s of the

taught in a very beautiful and brief little sermon

how it leads to these beautiful happiness’ and is a

practice of

samadhi
 and

"So make sure in your life as a monk, that you "
perfect the

4  LOOKING FOR THE SWEET CHILLI 
Seeking Happiness in the World 
1
st
 March 2000 
"When we stay in a monastery to practice meditation,"
 there’s a great development of 
mindfulness which is drawn inside instead of being 
directed only to the world outside.  
So 
the 
ideal 
of 
monastic 
life 
includes 
that 
part 
of
meditation 
which 
we 
call 
introspection.  We get in touch with ourself and ho
w we feel.  We look at what makes 
"us ‘tick’.  In particular, one starts to get in con"
tact with the happiness and suffering of 
"life.  Coming to a monastery, one is very often see"
"king meaning, seeking wisdom, "
"seeking happiness.  And indeed, those quests for me"
"aning, for wisdom, for happiness, "
"are quests that we can see all over the world, amon"
gst all people.  Even the animals 
and beings of other realms are seeking happiness an
"d meaning, and they are all "
running away from suffering.  If one can give life 
"a description, it is just the pursuit of "
happiness and the running away from pain and suffer
ing. 
"However, although it is the case that people, and a"
ll beings in 

 pursue that 
"happiness, they very rarely find it.  They seek ple"
asure and happiness but they just 
encounter suffering.  This is the truth of life whi
ch I have come up against again and 
"again, both in my own life and in the lives of the "
"people I have met, spoken with, and "
spent time with. 
We see that the whole world is just seeking happine
"ss, seeking pleasure, and very "
rarely finding it.  Very often the pleasure that pe
"ople seek is an empty pleasure, a false "
pleasure.  We’re like sheep following each another.
  When all the sheep commonly 
"agree that this is pleasure, every one goes along w"
"ith it.  No one ever calls the bluff, "
no one investigates what they feel. 
Last night coming back from giving a 
Dhamma
" talk in Armadale, we had to stop to "
fill up with petrol at the service station.  Next t
o us was a group of young men and 
"women, maybe eighteen, nineteen or twenty years old"
", just ‘cruising’ as the saying "
goes.  With nothing much to do in the evening they 
"were just acting silly, like a bunch "
of idiots.  Even though to me what they were talkin
g about and how they were 
"cavorting looked crazy and stupid, to them it was s"
upposed to be ‘cool’.  They thought 
50
it was happy and pleasurable.  I think it was commo
nly agreed that that was the thing 
to do and so no one ever questioned whether what th
ey were doing was happiness or 
not. 
I recall that in my life I have always asked questi
ons.  Questioning and probing leads 
to 
real 
happiness. 
Questioning 
and 
investigating 
w
hat 
this 
life 
is 
all 
"about, "
questioning what pleasure is.  Is this real pleasur
e?  What’s life all about anyway?  
"This was something that led me to a monastic life, "
"led me to meditation, and led me to "
where I am now.  I’ve sometimes given talks where I
’ve summed up the Buddha’s 
teaching of the Four Noble Truths into two truths: 
" what is real happiness, and how do "
I get it.  These are basically the two questions th
at propel human beings and animals 
through life.  Finding out what happiness is and ho
w we can secure it for ourselves. 
Is This It? 
The first thing I want to point out here is that yo
u cannot always believe what other 
people say is happiness.  I trod that path in my ea
rly years.  People said that happiness 
was the rock bands and the drugs.  They said happin
ess was sex and travel.   I’ve been 
there and done that and to me it wasn’t happiness a
t all.  When we are doing all those 
things we are always just waiting for something to 
happen.  Where is this happiness 
that people have promised?  Is there something wron
g with me?  Am I not doing it 
"right?  There was some happiness, but just for a mo"
"ment maybe.  At the same time, "
there was a lot of tension from sex and relationshi
ps.  Getting drunk was supposed to 
"be so much fun and so great.  And, talking about dr"
"ugs, where was the real pleasure or "
meaning in that?  But at least I had a mind that wo
uld question.  I could look back 
"afterwards and say:  “This is stupid, this is meani"
ngless.  What am I doing this for?  
Where is it getting me?  Am I really satisfying any
thing here?  I’m just as lost 
afterwards as I was before”. 
Whenever I followed any of those pleasures in the w
orld I found that there was 
"always this craving, this hunger and thirst.  There"
 was a real fever beforehand and 
then emptiness afterwards.  Is that it?  So what!  
"So, ‘Is this it?’ became a motto for "
my life in the lay world.  Working all those years 
to get a degree and that’s all it is.  
So what!   What have I worked so hard all of these 
years for?   Is this it?  Getting into 
relationships – is that it?  So what! 
51
Listening to fine music.  Is this it?  So what!  As
 soon as the music ended there was a 
"hole and that hole was caused by craving, we just f"
ill in something temporarily.  It 
"was like plastering over a crack in the wall, and a"
s soon as the plaster dries the crack 
reappears. 
We 
aren’t 
really 
solving 
the 
problem; 
w
e 
are just 
plastering 
it 
over 
"temporarily.  Certainly in my life, due to the sear"
"ch for pleasure, the search for "
"meaning, the search for some sort of happiness, I s"
tarted to really doubt and question 
the world out there.  I questioned the lay life.  A
t least I had some inspiration – I don’t 
know where from – almost certainly from a past life
", I suppose. "
My inspiration was to try and look for that peace a
nd happiness in the monastic life.  
When I saw Buddhist monks they seemed to be the mos
"t peaceful, the happiest and "
the most together people I’d ever seen.  This shock
"ed me a little, because the first "
thing I had read about Buddhism was the teaching of
" the Four Noble Truths, which is "
all about suffering.  I couldn’t understand why it 
was that these monks – I’m talking 
"as a lay person, seeing my first monks – were talki"
ng about suffering and about giving 
"up things, but they were the happiest people I had "
ever seen.  Their smiles and their 
serenity was something that made me question my pre
vious life style. 
"When those monks talked about suffering, they were "
always smiling and that really 
intrigued me.  What was going on?  Later on when I 
"started to meditate, I had a "
"powerful and deep experience of happiness, and that"
 was even more intriguing.  Why 
was 
it 
that 
in 
the 
search 
for 
happiness 
in 
the 
worl
"d, "
with 
its 
many 
different 
"possibilities of happiness, the one which seemed to"
" work the most, the one which "
"seemed to be the most profound and long lasting, th"
e one which seemed to be the 
"most pure, was experienced in deep meditation durin"
g a retreat as a lay person? 
That experience really made me consider what these 
Four Noble Truths were all 
about.  Later when I became a monk I began to expla
in the Four Noble Truths in a 
"slightly different way, still true to the original "
teachings but in a way that was a little 
bit easier for the lay community to understand.  I 
started to talk about the Four Noble 
"Truths as being the Noble Truth of happiness, the c"
"ause of happiness, the cessation of "
unhappiness and the way leading to happiness.  I li
kened happiness with the end of 
suffering and the way leading to happiness with the
 Eightfold Path.  It was true to the 
52
"original teachings, but it was just explained from "
a slightly different angle. 
"Certainly to me that made so much sense, because th"
e years that I spent as a young 
"monk, "
which 
are 
supposed 
to 
be 
years 
of 
"hardship, "
w
ere 
in 
fact 
years 
of 
great 
"fulfilment, of great happiness and great peace.  Ev"
"en having to eat frogs in Thailand, I "
was a happy monk.  I was peaceful and I enjoyed the
 life style.  Now twenty five 
years 
on 
I 
can 
look 
back 
and 
understand 
why 
there 
w
as 
that 
enjoyment. 
That 
enjoyment was caused by letting go.  It is the enjo
yment that is caused by ending 
things.  It is the happiness of peace.  I found out
", certainly for myself, that what we "
"really know as true happiness, true contentment, ha"
s to be peacefulness; it is where 
things end.  It is where movement is stilled and th
e problems are gone; this is true 
"happiness.  Knowing that, we find out that there is"
 a path to true happiness.  It’s the 
path of stillness.  It is the path of letting go.  
"It is the path of giving up attachments, "
giving up craving. 
Some people think that they can’t give up attachmen
"ts, and they can’t give up craving.  "
"Basically it’s not up to you, if you give it time, "
it has to happen.  It’s only a matter of 
giving causes and effects the time to work.  It’s n
o more possible than a flower 
"deciding not to bloom, or deciding when it will blo"
om.  The flower just blooms 
according to its season and that’s all there is to 
it.  In the same way a person starts to 
engage 
in 
the 
path 
of 
letting 
"go, "
of 
going 
against 
craving 
and 
going 
against 
"attachments.  When we are on a happy path, it’s alw"
ays a sign that we’re beginning to 
"understanding some Dhamma, some teachings, some tru"
ths.  It’s a sign that we are 
putting 
that 
understanding 
into 
practice 
because 
it
’s 
giving 
us 
greater 
"happiness, "
"greater peace, greater contentment. "
"Somewhere in this world, somewhere in this life, yo"
u’re going to have to find some 
contentment.  Otherwise you’re going to be running 
around as if you are being chased 
by a swarm of bees that are stinging you.  Never be
ing able to escape the pressure of 
"suffering in life, one has to find some place where"
" there’s contentment, where there’s "
"peace, where there’s freedom from the struggle.  So"
metimes when we talk about 
freedom people don’t understand what that word mean
s.  It’s not freedom to follow 
"defilements, craving and attachments.  That’s what "
"people in the world call freedom, "
"the freedom to cruise around, get drunk and to ‘do "
drugs’ or whatever.  That sort of 
53
freedom is not freedom at all because it is just gi
ving in to coarse desires which never 
"lead to anything fulfilling, useful or happy.  Peop"
le have seen that in the world and 
they’ve seen that in others.  Surely they should be
 able to see that in themselves.  
"Those things only lead to more suffering, more enta"
"nglement, and more problems. "
Real freedom is the freedom to say no.  The freedom
 to say no to the forces in the 
"mind that stop one being peaceful, the forces in th"
e mind that keep blowing you from 
"place to place, from person to person.  Instead of "
being blown around in this world 
"there has to come a time, there has to be a place, "
"there has to be a spot, where one "
stands still like a mountain.  Although the wind bl
"ows, you don’t move.  The wind can "
"blow and blow, but you don’t move and eventually th"
e wind gives up.  That symbol of 
a mountain is the symbol of an 

 who has let go of moving according to the 
cravings and the defilements.  We have to decide to
" stand still, just to be here, and not "
move from the present moment. 
Views and Ideas 
People 
sometimes have the idea that happiness and p
leasure is achieved by just 
following the idiocy of the world.  What people in 
"the world say is happiness, the "
Enlightened ones say is suffering.  What the Enligh
"tened ones say is happiness, the "
world says is suffering.  What is it that people in
 the word say is happiness?  If you 
read the magazines or the newspapers you can see th
at people say happiness is the 
"new movie, the new relationship, going here, going "
"there, and having children and so "
on.  You haven’t lived until you’ve been up the Ama
zon! – or whatever people may 
say is happiness in the world.  I’ve explored many 
places and experienced many 
"things in my life, and somehow they all seem so emp"
ty and meaningless.  I can’t 
"imagine why people still run after those things, wh"
y they haven’t seen the suffering 
"and the pain of travel, of sex, and of relationship"
s. 
In Buddhism there is the simile of the horse.  Ther
"e was a wise horse, a smart horse, a "
"heedless horse, a stupid horse and a very, very stu"
"pid horse, and there is also the "
trainer with a whip.  The wise horse doesn’t even n
eed to see the whip:  the trainer 
"tells him to do something, and the horse does it st"
raight away.  The horse knows that 
is in its best interest.  That’s the path to happin
ess.  Sometimes the trainer has to pick 
up the whip and let the shadow of it fall on the ho
rse.  The shadow of the whip falls 
54
"on the horse and the smart horse knows, “I’d better"
 do the right thing or it’s going to 
"hurt.”  The next horse, being heedless, has to be t"
apped lightly.  Just a little bit of 
"suffering, just a tap, and it’s enough for the hors"
"e to know what’s in its interest, what "
the path to happiness is.   The next horse is stupi
"d and the trainer has to whack it once, "
"‘Ow!’  It hurts once, and when it hurts once, that’"
s enough; the horse knows which 
"way to go.  Of course the very, very stupid horse i"
s the horse that has to be hit again 
"and again, ‘Ow!  Ow!  Ow!’  It still keeps doing th"
"e same stupid things, ‘Ow!  Ow!  "
"Ow!’  The foolish horse wonders what’s going on, bu"
"t it’s amazing how many people, "
"even in a monastery, fall into that last category. "
Haven’t you suffered enough already?  What are you 
doing this for?  It’s easy to be 
"happy, just stop doing anything, be peaceful and go"
 against the stream.  Sometimes its 
just habit that holds us back.  The horse is so set
" in its ways, especially in its ways of "
"thinking, that it’s hard to change.  The horse thin"
ks that next time the whip won’t hit 
him or he will be able to escape.  Next time he wil
"l be able to out-smart the trainer, "
"but of course, ‘Ow! Ow! Ow!’  It happens again! "
"The Mullah Nasrudin was eating a bunch of chillies,"
" eating one after the other, until "
"his face was red, his eyes were streaming, and his "
nose was running.  That is what 
happens when you eat too many hot chillies.  He was
 still munching those chillies 
"when someone came up and asked him, “Why are you ea"
ting so many hot chillies?”  
Mullah Nasrudin said “I’m looking for the sweet one
".”  This is what people do in life, "
"whether it’s a relationship, a place, or a job – ev"
en some monks looking 
for a 
monastery – they’re still looking for the sweet one
".  Of course, there is no sweet one.   "
"Chillies are chillies, they are all hot, and it’s a"
" waste of time to keep eating, eating, "
looking for the sweet one in life. 
This is something that you have to experience for y
ourself.  If you’re smart you don’t 
need to be hit many times.  But it’s more than just
 realizing suffering; it’s also 
"realizing the opposite of suffering, which is recog"
nizing happiness.  If one just focuses 
"on the suffering of life, that is not enough of an "
incentive for people to do what’s 
necessary to find liberation from suffering.  We of
"ten get used to our suffering, we "
take it for granted and we think that’s all there i
s.  We become accepting of the 
suffering in the world. 
55
We have a story in Buddhism of the worm in a pile o
f dung.  Being so attached to that 
"pile of dung, the worm thinks it’s in heaven.  This"
 is the trouble with people and 
suffering: they have some suffering and they get us
ed to it.  They then think that 
suffering is heaven. 
Coming to a place like this – to the monastic life 
– we have an opportunity to see 
"something else, something deeper, something more.  "
We have the opportunity to see 
real happiness.  Not some happiness which is promis
"ed when you die, not some "
happiness which is somehow in a distant future.  “I
f you make good 
kamma
", then "
you’ll be happy.  Just believe me and then you’ll b
e okay.”  The happiness that you 
"can experience in monastic life is the happiness, w"
hich is 
		
","
 available in this 
very life.  It’s right in this moment if you care t
o look at it.  One of the things that I 
find in my meditation is that in any moment we can 
get to that peace.  All we need to 
do is flick the right switch in our mind.  It’s a m
omentary attainment.  All we need to 
do is find that ‘letting go’ switch.  Once we know 
"that switch, that movement of the "
"mind, whether it’s our meditation or when we’re eat"
"ing our meal, or whatever else we "
"may be doing, it becomes so easy, so peaceful.  Tha"
t is because we’ve found the Third 
"Noble Truth, the letting go of suffering. "
Once we get to that point it’s so easy to repeat it
 and just let go.  It’s the simplest thing 
to do once we know how to do it.  It’s like riding 
"a bike, once we’ve learned to ride a "
bike it’s the simplest thing in the world.  We don’
t need to think about it.  When we 
first 
get 
onto 
a 
bike 
we 
wobble 
all 
over 
the 
place.
I 
think 
many 
of 
you 
can 
"understand, or a least appreciate, what I am saying"
".  The path to real happiness, the "
path to the ending of suffering is the ability just
" to open up, to let go and be free from "
craving.  The whole monastery here is shouting out 
to us to let go and renounce.  
That’s the meaning of this monastery. 
Oh What Bliss! 
"Last night, I was talking to the lay people in Arma"
dale about the conception of 
emptiness.  Emptiness is another word for letting g
o.  If we let go of things we are left 
"with this beautiful, awesome emptiness.  Because em"
ptiness is something that is so 
"profound, people often don’t realize what it is, so"
 they miss it.  They can’t see it.  
56
People have got a blind spot to emptiness.  That’s 
why in the 
"- 
**"
"Sutta"
 (MN 
121) the Buddha explains the way to develop the per
ception to recognize what the 
mind is free from.  Recognize that in the monastery
 this evening we are free from so 
"many burdens.  We’re free from television, free fro"
m relationships.  We’re free from 
bills.  We’re free from having to go to work.  We’r
e free from all the bitterness that 
can so easily oppress us in life. 
In one particular 
Sutta
 the Buddha encouraged the monks to bring up the pe
rception 
"of what we’re free from, because that gives us a se"
"nse of happiness, the happiness "
born of freedom.  “

 a monk said this as he 
sat 
under 
a 
tree. 
He 
was 
an 
"ex-king, "
and 
the 
other
monks 
thought 
he 
was 
"remembering his life as a king, with all the sensor"
y pleasures he then had.  When they 
"asked him afterwards if that was the case, he said,"
" “No, no”, I was saying “"

"

! 
 Oh what bliss!  Oh what bliss!” because now I am f
"ree from all of that, free "
from 
the 
"concerns, "
the 
worries 
and 
the 
bitterness 
o
f 
being 
a 
king. 
“Oh 
what 
"happiness, oh what bliss!”  This is what I encourag"
e you to do in your meditation; 
"remember what you’ve left behind.  “Oh what bliss, "
"oh what bliss, to be free of the "
"streets!”  “Oh what bliss, oh what bliss, to be fre"
"e of the work place!”  “Oh what bliss, "
to be free from the pressures of relationships!”  “
"Oh what bliss, oh what bliss, to be "
"free from concerns about money, and acquiring posse"
ssions!” 
In a monastery such as this you are free from so ma
ny things.  Even if you’re just here 
for a few hours or days you’re free from many burde
"ns, and the mind dwells upon the "
perception of what you’ve let go.  This is dwelling
 on the Third Noble Truth.  This is 
"dwelling on cessation, ending and emptiness.  This "
is dwelling on 
!!
" itself or, at "
"least, it is leaning in that direction.   When you "
cultivate the perception of the Third 
"Noble Truth in this way, it points out to you what "
this happiness in monastic life 
really is.  If we forget that perception of emptine
"ss, we just don’t see it and we think "
there is nothing there. 
There is a big difference between nothing and empti
ness.  Nothing is something you 
"can’t see, emptiness is something you can really ap"
preciate.  Once we start to develop 
"these sorts of perceptions we say:  “Hey, this is r"
eal happiness!  This is real peace!  
57
This is real contentment!  This is really fulfillin
g!”  We are noticing the happiness of 
"things ending, not the happiness of things beginnin"
g.  We’re noticing the happiness of 
"having nothing to do, rather than looking for somet"
hing to do.  We’re noticing the 
happiness of space rather than the happiness of thi
ngs.  As we begin to focus on the 
"perceptions of emptiness, we’re finding out what re"
al happiness is.  The more we 
"empty out, the more happiness we feel.  We can empt"
y our mind of thought and see 
"how peaceful, wonderful and blissful it is if our m"
ind is not obsessed or tyrannized by 
"this one thing, which we call thinking. "
The Inner Commentator 
People sometimes play really heavy and oppressive m
usic in their cars.  If it’s not that 
"sort of music, it’s some other music.  In the shopp"
"ing centres, in the airports or "
"wherever else we go, we hear music.  At our City Ce"
"ntre, I often just want to sit "
"quietly, but people come to me and want advice on t"
heir problems.  There is so much 
"noise in the world!  It’s so nice in the evenings, "
"when everyone has left, to go back to "
"my room and be quiet again, “Oh what bliss!”   That"
" noise outside, people asking "
"questions, asking you to do things, making arrangem"
"ents, that’s the same sort of noise "
as the noise we hear in our mind.  It’s the ‘inner 
"commentator’ telling us what to do, "
"telling us to go this way, or that way.  That inner"
 commentator telling us we are not 
good 
"enough, "
we’re 
this 
"way, "
or 
we’re 
that 
way. 
Wh
en 
that 
noise 
stops 
it’s 
"marvellous.  We’re left with just the emptiness, th"
"e bliss of no speech, of no thinking; "
of no one telling us what to do. 
I have always rebelled against people telling me wh
at to do.  That’s why I’m not a 
very authoritarian abbot.  I don’t really go around
" telling everyone what to do, not all "
"the time anyway.  Because my mind is rebellious, I "
noticed that in my mind there was 
always someone telling me what to do.  ‘Come on med
itate.’  ‘Meditate longer.’  ‘Get 
up early.’  ‘Come on don’t sleep in so much.’  ‘Com
e on get your mind together.’  
‘Give better talks.’  ‘Don’t eat so much.’  ‘Be a b
etter example to the younger monks.’  
"‘Rah, rah, rah, rah.’  That was just like being tol"
d what to do again.  Sometimes that 
would almost drive me crazy. 
"When we listen to that, it’s very easy to get depre"
ssed.  That inner commentator can 
be the cause of depression.  Because that inner com
mentator is always – at least for 
58
me – so fault finding.  We really have to watch out
" for that inner commentator, not "
"just in monastic life, but also in lay life, in all"
" life, because that’s someone we just "
cannot trust.  In monastic life at least we have an
other perspective.  We have other 
people encouraging us to look at that inner comment
ator with a sense of separation 
and with mindfulness.  Just listen to the rubbish t
he inner commentator keeps on 
"telling you, again and again.  It’s only when we be"
lieve in that inner commentator that 
we get into trouble.  That inner thought cannot be 
"trusted.  It’s not the truth, it’s not "
accurate. 
"I remember once, on a meditation path in a monaster"
y in Thailand.  I was watching 
my thoughts and getting some separation from them. 
 As I watched the thoughts 
"without getting too involved in them, they appeared"
" to me to be so stupid, because I "
could 
trace 
how 
every 
thought 
that 
came 
up 
was 
cond
itioned. 
They 
were 
all 
conditioned; I was just repeating what I had been t
aught in the past.  There wasn’t 
even one original thought.  The thoughts weren’t re
ally coming from me.  I could see 
the same words coming from my own biological father
", or from people who had "
impressed me.  I was just repeating the words like 
a parrot.  When we see that with 
"mindfulness, the inner conversation is seen for wha"
"t it is, just "
the
echoes of the past
.  
"We believe in something that has no substance, some"
thing that isn’t real and which 
has no truth to it.  I just couldn’t believe in it 
anymore and then a wonderful thing 
"happened.  When I didn’t believe in the thinking, i"
t just stopped and I had one of my 
most beautiful meditations. 
Before that insight I had believed all of my though
ts.  I’d argue with my friends but 
I’d never argue with myself.  I’d never doubted any
 thought that came up into my 
mind; I’d always take it as absolute truth.  If I d
"idn’t like something, if that’s what the "
"thought was, then I didn’t like it and that for me "
"was the truth.  Afterwards, because I "
completely 
pulled the rug out from beneath my own t
"hinking, I wouldn’t easily "
believe what other people said.  I’d be very questi
"oning about what I read in books, I "
was always challenging it.  On the meditation path 
when we are challenging thought 
"itself, we realize how much of a bubble it is.  I p"
"ricked the bubble, it went ‘pop’, and "
there was nothing left.  That’s what thinking is!  
It is thinking that blows you from 
place to place.  It’s thinking that creates all the
 trouble if you believe in it.  Watch 
"those thoughts, reflect upon them, and see them fro"
m a distance as an observer. 
59
Watch 
this 
inner 
conversation 
going 
backwards 
and 
f
orwards 
with 
a 
sense 
of 
"detachment.  The more we watch it with detachment, "
"with mindfulness, the more we "
will loosen our belief in the accuracy of our thoug
hts.  But if we can’t believe in what 
"we think, what can we believe in?  The answer is:  "
"we can believe in the silence, in "
that emptiness.  That emptiness is far more truthfu
"l, far more real than the thinking. "
Thinking 
is 
just 
a 
commentary. 
I 
sometimes 
critici
ze 
the 
commentaries 
of 
the 
Buddhist 
teachings. 
The 
Buddha’s 
teachings 
are 
muc
h 
more 
real 
than 
the 
commentaries.  Commentaries are just people’s ideas
" about what happened, in the "
same way as the commentary we have about our experi
ences.  That inner conversation 
"is not accurate, it’s just a thought that comes up "
and goes away.  It comes conditioned 
according to the moods of our mind.  If we’re upset
" we have rotten thoughts, if we are "
in a great mood we have nice thoughts.  Which thoug
"hts are real?  Neither of them, "
they’re all just coloured and bent by conditions.  
"That’s why now, when we see that, "
we don’t believe in any of those thoughts.  When I 
"want to leave, I don’t believe in it; "
"when I want to stay, I don’t believe in it.  When I"
’m annoyed because a monk did 
something really unskilful – ‘He shouldn’t have don
"e that, he should have known "
better’ – I don’t believe in that.  When a monk has
" been really, really, great and done "
"wonderful, marvellous things, I don’t believe in th"
at.  Instead I believe in the silence. 
The Fabric of Reality 
"If I have faith in anything, it’s in silence.  When"
" I believe in that silence, it’s an "
experience that is real.  It’s also an experience w
hich gives much more happiness.  It 
gives perspective to all these thoughts.  It puts t
he thoughts in their proper place.  It’s 
not that the thoughts are not real; it’s just that 
the thoughts are disturbers of the 
silence.  Once you let the thoughts go the silence 
returns.  The silence is more like the 
"fabric of reality.  That’s why in a monastery, if y"
"ou listen closely enough, you can "
hear that silence around you and you can hear the s
ilence in your mind. 
Once 
we 
can 
hear 
that 
silence 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
touch
that 
"emptiness, "
there 
is 
something 
about 
it 
that 
we 
know 
is 
"real, "
even 
befor
e 
we 
start 
thinking 
this 
is 
"meaningful, this is peaceful, this is happiness.  A"
fter a while we become a connoisseur 
of that peacefulness and we value it.  We look upon
" it as a great jewel, a great gem "
60
that 
is 
very 
valuable. 
This 
world 
doesn’t 
value 
si
lence 
at 
"all, "
it 
doesn’t 
value 
emptiness.  Wherever there is nothing people want t
o put something in.  When there is 
quietness they want to speak.  When there is a spac
e they want to fill it up.  That’s 
craving; that’s foolishness; that’s a lack of confi
dence; it’s fear.  We think because of 
fear.  We move because of fear.  We crave because o
f fear.  It takes courage just to let 
go. 
"Because you’ve come to a monastery, there is someth"
"ing inside each of you, which "
"has sensed that in silence, in letting go, there is"
 peace.  Each of you has already lived 
enough 
years 
to 
have 
been 
disappointed 
"many, "
many 
t
imes 
in 
the 
search 
for 
happiness.  But once you start to turn to silence a
"nd to emptiness, you will remember "
"it and value it.  That silence, that emptiness, beg"
ins to be noticed in so many places.  
You notice the emptiness in your room; that’s why t
he best monks are the monks with 
the fewest possessions.  You notice it in the empti
ness of your daily schedule with 
fewer duties.  You notice it in the emptiness of yo
ur mind. 
"In other words, fewer thoughts are needed.  We noti"
ce that in the emptiness of our 
"movements.  We tend to stay still more, rather than"
 always coming and going.  We’re 
"letting go, we’re simplifying.  The more things we "
"have, the more things we do.  The "
"more places we go, the more complicated we make our"
 life style.  Those of you who 
are travelling will know how complicated it is to t
"ravel, the family arrangements and "
how it involves so many other people.  Sometimes we
 think what are we travelling 
"for?  Wherever I go, there I am.  What is the point"
"!  I sometimes look at that, and if "
"it’s not for someone else’s benefit, I can’t see th"
e point in travelling for myself.  I 
"might as well just stay here, because whatever is o"
ver there is also over here.  That 
"emptiness, that silence, that space, you can see it"
" anywhere.  Especially the silence, "
"the space between our ears, it’s the emptiness of t"
he mind. 
It is strange that when some people become quiet in
" their meditation, even just for a "
"moment, they feel so challenged by that silence tha"
t they disturb it.  I think many 
"people actually leave a monastery, because they can"
’t stand the silence.  They’re 
afraid of it.  They want to fill it up with activit
y or with movement.  There’s a lot of 
truth to that in a very deep sense.  We can see tha
"t sometimes in meditation, when "
"things start to get still, ‘Wow!’ that’s a bit much"
".  But after a while, a person in "
61
monastic life 
does respect 
"the silence, does value "
the 
"silence, and "
when anyone 
"respects and values these things, they meet them mo"
re and more. 
I know that some monks would like to see 
#
.   If you believe in 
#
", perhaps "
they might come and see you.  It’s much more import
ant to be able to believe in the 
"silence, so that the silence can come and meet you."
  That silence is the ending of 
"things, the quietness of the mind.  When there is s"
"ilence in the mind, there’s no "
thinking.  When there is no thinking how can there 
be craving?  How can there be the 
"wanting to come this way, or go that way?  How can "
there be wanting anything?  How 
can there be dissatisfaction or elation in the endi
ng of thought? 
Of course this is a temporary ending to the movemen
ts in the mind.  But by actually 
emptying 
your mind of things 
you find that allows g
"reater spaciousness, greater "
"freedom.  In the same way, when you empty your hut "
"of things, there’s more freedom "
in that hut to move around.  When you empty your mi
nd of things there is more 
"freedom to move around and there’s more peace, more"
 happiness.  So the aim of the 
meditation 
should 
be 
to 
abandon 
things. 
The 
aim 
is
getting 
rid 
of 
"things, "
not 
accumulating 
more. 
The 
aim 
of 
meditation 
should 
be
"stillness, "
not 
to 
keep 
on 
moving.  There has to come a time when you stand yo
"ur ground and let go, wherever "
that place is. 
The only thing I remember from Zen Buddhism is a qu
estion that a monk asked his 
pupil.  The pupil had just returned to the main mon
astery after spending a long time 
on solitary retreat.  The monk punched him – that’s
 what Zen monks used to do – and 
"asked the pupil, “When is there going to be an end "
to all this coming and going?”  I 
"always remember that statement, because I used to a"
"sk myself, ‘When is there going "
"to be an end to all this coming and going’, and of "
course the answer is now. 
Now has to be the ending of coming and going.  Just
 let go of all that movement of 
the mind.  It’s only when we see the feeling of pea
"cefulness, the feeling of emptiness, "
as 
a 
"powerful, "
"sublime, "
deep 
happiness 
that 
we 
star
t 
to 
appreciate 
what 
makes 
monastic life tick.  Monastic life is all about the
 happiness of that silence and the 
"happiness of peace.  The more we touch it, the more"
" we appreciate it, the more we "
understand it.  We also understand that this is the
 way to the highest happiness.  
62
Contentment is the highest happiness
. 
All craving is reaching out trying to achieve happi
ness.  “If I can just get this one 
"more thing, then I’ll be happy.  If I can just get "
"that car, then I’ll be happy.  If I can "
"just get that beautiful girl, then I’ll be happy.  "
"If I can just get my sickness healed, "
then I’ll be happy.  If I can just get my meditatio
"n correct, then I’ll be happy.”  It’s "
always craving and it’s always happiness in the fut
ure.  It’s the same thing that 
motivates some people to just keep going to church 
"or to the temple, to ensure they’ll "
go to heaven.  It’s just another form of craving th
at’s all. 
These 
cravings 
can 
never 
lead 
to 
the 
end 
of 
sufferi
ng. 
Craving 
leads 
to 
more 
suffering. 
We 
can 
see 
that 
very 
easily. 
Craving 
–
wanting 
something 
"more, "
something in the future – can only lead to more suf
fering and more unhappiness.  We 
think that all we need is to satisfy just one more 
"craving, “I’ll just get this one more "
"thing, and then I’ll let go” – but of course it nev"
er works that way.   There is always 
one more thing afterwards:  another one more thing 
"and one more thing, until you die, "
"and after death, one more thing.  There has to be a"
" stopping, a letting go now, a time "
to say ‘no more craving’.  What I’ve got now is eno
"ugh, my mind is good enough and "
my body is good enough.  It doesn’t matter how old 
"and sick it is, my body is good "
enough. 
One of Ajahn Chah’s meditations was the ‘good enoug
h’ meditation.  This food is 
good enough; this monastery is good enough; this ta
lk is good enough.  Once you 
"have that good enough perception, craving stops.  I"
f this is good enough what do I 
want to change it for?  What do I want to move for?
  Why do I want to get anything 
else?  ‘Good enough’ is a cause for contentment.  Y
ou can try that in your meditation 
"to see if it works.  It’s amazing, if we do that, r"
"eally do it, one hundred percent, not "
ninety nine percent but one hundred percent good en
"ough, we find that the mind "
"calms down, becomes still, becomes concentrated and"
 peaceful.  
"%
"
" comes up, "
the 
nimmittas
" come up, and "
jhanas
 occur.  This happens simply because you stop that 
which causes movement in the mind.  Not just cravin
"g, but the cause of craving; the "
delusion that there is something more out there in 
"the future, in the next moment. "
The thought that ‘this is not enough’ is a delusion
.  It’s craving.  We know it’s 
63
delusion because it has kept us going for so many l
ifetimes.  It’s kept us going for the 
last twenty-four hours.  We’re always doing somethi
ng or else we want something 
"more, we’re never standing still.  If we realize th"
at this is good enough and we trust in 
"that one hundred percent, we discover that this rea"
"lly is good enough, and we have as "
much as we’ll ever need.  We stop wanting more.  We
 stop craving.  When we stop 
"craving, we stop thinking and we stop moving.  When"
" we stop moving, we’re in the "
"present moment, we’re silent.  The longer we keep t"
hat stillness the more chance 
contentment has to build up.  We realize that all t
he jewels and wealth in the world are 
right here.  All the bliss and happiness we could e
"ver want are right in this moment, "
and we may even start crying with happiness.  We re
"alize we had it all along, but we "
always throw away the jewel of 
!!
 for something else. 
We always want something else.  But if we just stop
", be empty and be still, we will "
find out that contentment is happiness.  The more c
ontentment we have the more 
happiness we build up.  Happiness upon happiness up
on happiness!  If you do it this 
"way, I’ll guarantee that there is so much happiness"
 you won’t know how you will be 
"able to take anymore.  You get more bliss, more she"
er pleasure out of meditation than 
you do from anything else.  That’s my experience an
"yway.  We get that, just by "
"stopping, by letting go. "
We’re not only experiencing pleasure for pleasure’s
 sake.  Even as monks we are 
"permitted this pleasure, it’s allowable, it’s not d"
angerous.  That needs to be said 
because sometimes people are afraid of that pleasur
e.  They think there must be 
something wrong with the bliss of 
jhana
.  It’s really strange how some people are 
"afraid of the beautiful pleasures, the good pleasur"
es.  But they are not afraid of the 
crazy 
"pleasures, "
the 
pleasures 
of 
"sex, "
the 
pleasure
s 
of 
"food, "
the 
pleasures 
of 
conversation and the pleasures of craving.  People 
"are not afraid of those pleasures, "
but they are afraid of the really wholesome pleasur
es.  What foolishness! 
The 
pleasures 
of 
deep 
"meditation, "
"stillness, "
lettin
g 
"go, "
giving 
"up, "
renouncing; 
"stopping, these are all words referring to the same"
 thing:  emptying – going to that 
"emptiness, just fathering that emptiness, and seein"
g it grow like a beautiful lotus 
flower.  The most beautiful lotus flower we have ev
er seen in the mind’s eye is just 
opening and opening.  We’re going to see why.  We a
re going to have the insight and 
64
the wisdom of the Four Noble Truths.  We will know 
"what suffering is, what "
"dukkha"
"is, not as an intellectual theory, but as an experi"
ence.  We’ve been there; we’ve felt it 
and we’ve been burnt up with craving.  We’ve reache
"d out and blown the bliss, and "
we know that is suffering.  We know the suffering o
f being lost in the illusion of the 
"world, of always having to go backwards and forward"
"s, seeking this and seeking that, "
"trying to build our happiness on other people, on o"
"ther things, and seeing that all those "
other things and people are completely unreliable. 
" We cannot depend upon them, "
they let us down.  Our false scaffolding of happine
ss crashes and we crash and injure 
ourselves with it. 
We’ve been there and done that so many times.  
There is happiness in the world and 
that happiness is inside of us
.  We don’t have to go anywhere else to find it.  W
e have 
to go inside ourselves.  We won’t find happiness by
 stepping out into the world or by 
"stepping out to Thailand, or Sri Lanka, or wherever"
 else we want to go.  We will only 
find happiness and liberation inside this body and 
mind.  Wherever we happen to be 
on this planet that is the only place we can find h
appiness.  We carry it around with 
"us, so what is the need to go elsewhere, except inw"
"ard?  Stop and see that suffering, "
and know that suffering.  How many more years do we
 have to follow suffering and 
be a victim of suffering?  Instead distrust sufferi
"ng, distrust craving, distrust thinking; "
just stop for a few moments and look. 
Look into this present moment.  Look at what happen
"s when we don’t follow craving, "
when we really let go.  Look at what happens when w
e follow instead the Third Noble 
Truth:

Dhamma
.  It is the Four Noble

‘Wow!’

This is the opposite of suffering.  This is freedom

.  This is happiness; the best 
happiness we’ve ever had.  This happiness is what k
"eeps me going as a monk, the "
"serenity, the peace, the letting go.  That freedom "
is what is behind the smile and the 
"peace of all the great mystics, and the great "

teaching that the Buddha saw under the

"happiness and suffering, you’re discovering it for "
yourself in your letting go.  If you 
"repeat that experience as much as you can, you’ll b"

"keeps you running backwards and forwards, both in t"

We’re finally finding out what real happiness is an

"something that we can experience for ourselves, tha"

I don’t care whether we are going anywhere tomorrow
 or tonight!  We can experience 
this ‘letting go’.  Look at the mind!  Detach from 
the mind!  See what you’re doing 
and stop ‘messing around’.  How much longer do you 
want to be blown around in this

Isn’t it time to be able to see

5  DETACHMENT 
5
th
 April 2000 
When we discuss the teachings of Buddhism we talk a
 lot about attachments.  This is 
a word that is often misunderstood and misused by m
any Buddhists.  If we don’t 
understand what the word means we can get into a lo
t of trouble and experience 
confusion.  The opposite of attachment is easier to
 understand it is called ‘letting go’.  
We always know when letting go is happening because
 things disappear.  We don’t 
know when attachment happens because most of the ti
me we can’t see it.  The nature 
"of delusion, the core problem of human beings, is t"
o blind us.  Delusion or illusion if 
you 
"like, "
is 
called 

in 
Pali
and 
that 
delusion 
and 
lack 
of enlightenment 
is 
something that we can’t see.  It’s a blind spot ins
"ide us, but we don’t know we are "
blind! 
The Road to Suffering 
The big problem of 

 or delusion is that a person who is deluded always
 thinks 
they are right.  That is the reason there are so ma
ny different ideas and opinions in this 
world.  We can’t see that that is not the correct w
"ay to look at things.  However, there "
is one way that we can find out what delusion is.  
Delusion is that which leads to 
suffering.  It’s that which leads to problems and d
ifficulties.  Wisdom is that which 
leads to the end of suffering and difficulties.  In
" the same way, attachment – which is "
the result of delusion – is that which causes suffe
"ring, pain and difficulty in our lives.  "
It’s detachment and letting go that frees us and le
"ads to us to happiness, peace and "
contentment.  This is the best way to understand th
e meaning of these terms.  If 
whatever is happening in our life is causing suffer
"ing or discomfort, it’s because of a "
"lack of contentment; contentment, which is there fo"
r the taking.  It means that we’re 
not seeing something.  We need to have at least eno
ugh wisdom and faith to challenge 
ourselves. 
"So often, it’s the sense of self, the sense of ego,"
 the sense of pride born of that ego; 
"which feeds the delusion, ‘I can’t be wrong, I’m ri"
"ght.’  ‘No one else understands, "
only me.’  It’s one’s ‘self’ that feeds the attachm
ents.  ‘This is right.’  ‘This is what I 
want to do.’  ‘This is the correct way.’  ‘This is 
the right idea.’  This delusion is 
attachment to views.  So often we just can’t see th
"at, because we think we have the "
67
right view.  It’s very hard for a human being to kn
"ow they are wrong, in fact no one "
thinks they are wrong.  We all think we are right. 
" That’s the problem!  Even though, "
"in a monastery, there can be thirty different peopl"
"e, everyone thinks they know the "
Dhamma
.  But everyone can’t know the 
Dhamma
 if they’ve all got different ideas. 
"This is where one needs a bit of humility, a bit of"
 faith or confidence in the teachings 
of the Buddha.  Fortunately the teachings of the Bu
ddha are very clear.  They have 
been well preserved and are reasonably well transla
ted.  So we can actually look at 
"those teachings for ourselves.  But even here, we’v"
e got to be very careful because of 
the way delusion works.  We can read into some of t
hose teachings things that aren’t 
"even there in the translations.  For example, attac"
hment!  We shouldn’t be attached.  
We shouldn’t even be attached to meditation.  We sh
ouldn’t be attached to being a 
monk.  We shouldn’t be attached to anything.  We sh
ouldn’t be attached to eating or 
not eating.  We shouldn’t even be attached to sleep
"ing.  So if that’s the case, don’t "
"sleep tonight.  This gets ridiculous and stupid, do"
"esn’t it?  However, people can read "
into it whatever they wish.  Some lay Buddhists eve
n say they shouldn’t be attached 
to the precepts.  But they don’t say they shouldn’t
 be attached to their wives and 
"children, to their coffee or whatever else it is th"
at serves their sensory gratification.  
They are just using attachment to fulfil their sens
ory desires and to criticise others 
who challenge them.  They are just using their sens
ory desires in an unfair way 
grounded in delusion and aimed to protect their com
"fort, aimed to protect the cravings "
and attachments that are binding them to this world
 of 

. 
If you want to check out these teachings of the Bud
"dha, you need to have intellectual "
"honesty, or at least a sense of integrity, to be ab"
le to see these teachings for what they 
are.  You have to see the whole of the teachings – 
not just some parts – without 
adding anything to them or taking anything away.  D
on’t just choose some very 
obscure passages that support your ideas.  Don’t re
ad so much into one or two hard to 
translate obscure passages and ignore the very grea
t mass of very clear and very 
"precise, repeated teachings, which you find through"
out the Buddhist Scriptures.  At 
least that much should give you a sense of understa
nding what the Buddha actually 
taught.  For those of you who have gone so far as t
"o become monks, you should have "
confidence 
and 
faith 
in 
what 
the 
Buddha 
"taught, "
and
you 
should 
have 
some 
confidence and faith in those monks who have been p
ractising for much longer than 
68
you.  That’s the reason we have 

", support, or depending upon another.  That’s "
"so important in the practice, because we cannot jus"
t depend upon ourselves. 
Personal Views 
We cannot become Enlightened all by ourselves.  Onl
y a Buddha can do that.  For that 
reason we need the help of other people.  We can se
"e how this is so, because everyone "
has their own ideas and we cling to those ideas ten
aciously.  We argue with the 
"teacher.  We even argue with the Buddha, because ev"
eryone else is wrong except us.  
‘I’m the only one who really understands!’  It’s im
portant to understand that unless 
"you’ve had an experience of Enlightenment, unless y"
ou are a Stream Winner; unless 
you are an 

", you should always take it as a given that you are"
 still deluded.  If 
one is a 
"

"
", an ordinary person, then "

 is still there and one hasn’t yet 
seen the 
Dhamma
".  There is still something missing.  So, one shoul"
d have the humility 
"to trust the teachings of the Buddha, the real "
Dhamma
.  That’s the only way we can 
have a hope of overcoming the attachments to our ow
n personal views. 
That attachment to one’s own personal views is prob
"ably one of the strongest, fiercest, "
"most tenacious, and most "
"dukkha"
 producing of all the attachments.  Attachment to 
views stops one from even getting on the path leadi
ng to the ending of suffering.  
People in this world are often so convinced of thei
r own views that they never 
challenge them at all.  This creates so much suffer
ing for themselves and others!  
Sometimes we can see exactly what people are doing.
  As the Buddha said in a simile 
"that he gave, we see them acting like a man walking"
 on a path leading into a pit of 
burning coals.  If he keeps on walking in that dire
ction you know he will end up in the 
"blazing pit of coals, causing suffering or even dea"
th.  You can tell him not to go in 
"that direction, to go in another direction instead,"
 but he just won’t listen.  He won’t 
change his view that this is the right way to go.  
I know this is a big problem with 
human beings.  It’s caused either through a lack of
 wisdom or a lack of faith. 
Wisdom and faith are two of the five 
Indriyas
", spiritual qualities that are also spiritual "
powers.  Sometimes they are translated as controlli
ng faculties because they are so 
important 
on 
the 
path 
to 
Enlightenment. 
The 
five 
Indriyas
are: 
"faith, "
"energy, "
"mindfulness, "
samadhi
 and wisdom.  If one hasn’t enough of these qualiti
es one will 
69
"always be on the wrong path, and one won’t be even "
getting close to 
!!
.  One 
won’t even be getting close to the door through whi
ch these great insight experiences 
can be found.  It is going in the wrong direction a
ltogether!  If one hasn’t got wisdom 
one needs to have a lot of faith.  The trouble is m
ost people already think they’ve got 
"lots of wisdom, and that leads them to think they d"
on’t need faith.  They ‘think’ and 
that’s the problem. 
One knows one has wisdom if the path is developing.
  One needs not just the ability to 
"keep virtuous conduct, the ability to restrain the "
"mind, and the ability to calm the "
"mind, but also the ability to eradicate the five hi"
"ndrances, the ability to get into a "
jhana
", and the ability to be equanimous and have clear i"
nsights coming up throughout 
the day.  All of these things are signs that your w
isdom is developing and the path is 
manifesting. 
If 
those 
things 
aren’t 
happening it 
m
eans 
our 
wisdom 
isn’t 
strong 
"enough, ‘"

jhana
**
", "
Panna


"’ (Dhp 372), ‘"
there is no 
jhana
" in one who lacks wisdom, nor is there wisdom in on"
e who lacks 
jhana
’.  These 
two depend upon each other.  So don’t think that yo
u are wise if you can’t get into 
deep meditation. 
There is no wisdom without 
jhana
".  That humbles one.  It humbles one to say, “Look,"
there are things in here that I just don’t understa
"nd, that I just don’t see.  Maybe I have "
to trust someone else.  Maybe I really can trust th
e teacher and have faith in him.  At 
the very least I can trust what the Buddha said in 
the 
"suttas"
”.  The clear teachings that 
we see in the 
"suttas"
 show us what we should be doing to overcome our at
tachments.  
The attachments that we have are the attachments to
" our views, attachments to the "
"sensory world of the five senses, attachments to ou"
"r business or to our projects, "
attachments to our thoughts and attachments to our 
emotions.  All these attachments 
have to be let go of and abandoned. 
Uncovering the Attachments 
The practise of abandoning the attachments is what 
we do when we sit or walk in 
"meditation, and also when we do anything else in th"
is monastery.  My training as a 
young monk in Thailand was all about uncovering the
 attachments that I had.  I could 
"see the coarser attachments, so I could abandon the"
m and let them go because I could 
70
see that they where causing suffering.  When Ajahn 
Chah was building the main hall 
"at Wat Pa Pong, where all the monks training under "
Ajahn Chah were ordained – 
some monks here were ordained in that hall at Wat P
a Pong – I was staying at Wat 
Pah Nanachat.  But because they needed more workers
 to help at Wat Pah Pong we 
were all called over there for a week.  There was a
 big mound of earth raised by the 
"monks, "
on 
which 
the 
ordination 
hall 
was 
going 
to 
be
built. 
No 
earth 
moving 
machinery was available so all the work was done wi
"th what they call ‘bungies’, hoes "
and wheel barrows. 
After making the mound there was a lot of earth lef
"t over, and because it was an "
eyesore Ajahn Chah told us to move it around to the
 side.  We spent a couple of days 
moving it to the side.  Not just for one or two hou
"rs, but from when the meal finished "
at about nine o’clock in the morning – with hardly 
time to brush your teeth – just 
moving wheel barrows until nine thirty or ten o’clo
ck at night.  Because we had faith 
in Ajahn Chah we did that.  When it got dark the ke
rosene lanterns were brought out 
so that we could see where we were going.  We worke
d until ten o’clock at night and 
then we had showers in cold water and rested.  It t
ook two or three days to move the 
earth.  When it was finished Ajahn Chah went off to
 another monastery for a few 
"days, and Ajahn Liam the second monk – he is now th"
e abbot at Wat Pa Pong – came 
"along and said, “No, that’s not in the right place."
  Move the earth”.  Again we worked 
"long hours for two or three days, moving that big p"
ile of earth to another place.  You 
can imagine how we felt as Westerners when Ajahn Ch
ah came back after three days 
"and said, “What did you move it over there for, I t"
"old you to move it over here?”  So, "
we had to move it all back again. 
"That was really a wonderful experience, because it "
actually taught me something.  It 
"taught me that I could suffer if I wanted to, or I "
could just accept it out of faith in 
"Ajahn Chah.  I could say, “These Thai monks are stu"
pid!  Why can’t they understand 
or make a decision?  This is a stupid way of doing 
things!  Why can’t they decide 
where to put the earth?  I never became a monk to s
hift earth for twelve hours a day”.  
That’s what I went to university to escape.  I thou
ght that if you go to university you 
don’t have to do that sort of work any more.  You c
an just spend your time telling 
others what to do.  I even thought that when you be
come an abbot you are the boss 
and you don’t have to work so hard.  What a joke!  
"What it taught me to say was, "
71
"“Look, if this is causing suffering, if it’s "
"dukkha"
" to have to move all this earth, it’s not "
the earth that is the cause of the suffering.  It’s
" not Ajahn Chah and Ajahn Liam, who "
are the cause of suffering.  It must be some delusi
"ons, some attachments or some "
craving inside me that is the cause of the sufferin
g”.  This is what Ajahn Chah kept on 
pointing at.  The first noble truth is that 
"dukkha"
 is not caused by work.  
"Dukkha"
 is not 
caused by mosquitoes.  
"Dukkha"
 is not caused by heat or by cold.  
"Dukkha"
 is caused by 
craving.  That’s the fundamental teaching of the Bu
ddha.  That taught me to look for 
"the cause of suffering elsewhere, not in the extern"
"als, but in ‘me’, in ‘my attitude’, in "
"‘my craving’, in ‘my attachment’, in ‘my delusions’"
. 
"Some people just lost it altogether and said, “Well"
", if this is monastic life, it’s not for "
me”.  They looked at monastic life as being the cau
se of suffering or the work as 
being 
the 
cause 
of 
suffering 
or 
the 
hierarchy 
as 
be
ing 
the 
cause 
of 
suffering.  
Everyone 
in 
this 
monastery 
should 
know 
the 
delusion
of 
that 
view. 
We 
learnt 
something through that experience.  We learnt that 
"if something causes suffering, "
there must be a wrong attitude.  I looked at some o
f the other monks and they were 
very happy to move that earth.  They weren’t just m
onks who liked working; some of 
them were great meditators.  People like Ajahn Liam
 could work all day and meditate 
all night.  I sometimes wondered how they could do 
"this, but they could do it and they "
did do it.  You read in the 
"suttas"
 about monks working.  That is all part of our duti
es.  
This is how we realise that it’s not the work that 
"is suffering, it is ones attachment to "
something.  It is one’s craving for something and o
ne’s delusion that is the cause of 
suffering. 
The 
Dhamma
" talk, the chanting, the mood or whatever else it i"
s – these aren’t the 
"cause of suffering.  In fact, in the whole of "

", this monastery is probably one of "
the most comfortable places to exist.  As far as ex
"ternal situations are concerned, you "
have very little to be concerned or worried about. 
 You have very few problems to 
deal with and it’s so comfortable in this monastery
.  Where else in the world can you 
"live like this.  There were days, a long while ago,"
" when you could live on the dole, but "
now I am told you have to work at the very minimum 
seventeen hours per week to get 
the dole.  Here you only have to work ten hours to 
get your food.  That’s almost half 
and that’s not counting the retreats and every thin
g else we do. 
72
If there is any suffering caused by the monastic li
"fe style, it’s due to your attachments, "
to the craving inside you.  You should look at that
", and find out what it is.  You know "
you have gained some insight and uncovered that att
achment and wrong view if you 
can work and be peaceful.  But if you cannot work a
"nd be peaceful, if you cannot "
"move earth all day and be peaceful, you will never "
be free from suffering.  If you can 
"live in this monastery or any other monastery, and "
"it’s just the same for you, then you "
"understand something about the nature of the mind, "
"the nature of freedom, the nature "
of attachments and the nature of letting go.  Whate
"ver food you eat, whatever you’re "
"called upon to do, it doesn’t matter. "
Give This Moment Joy 
There is a teaching in the 
"suttas"
" where a monk says, “It’s too hot to meditate”.  “I"
t’s 
too cold to meditate.”  “It’s too early to meditate
.”  It’s too late to meditate.”  Monks 
like that will never gain liberation from suffering
".  Whether it’s hot, whether it’s cold, "
"whether it’s late, doesn’t matter, just meditate no"
w.  Whether I’m tired or whether I’m 
"energetic, it doesn’t matter, just now I’m meditati"
ng.  This is how I was trained and it 
"is a training that I’d like to share with you, so t"
hat you will be able to develop a mind 
that is independent of the external situations and 
circumstances.  A mind that really 
can ‘let go’ of the world and ‘let go’ of the body.
  That’s why the great forest teachers 
– the ones who are Enlightened and give teachings t
o create other Enlightened monks 
"– always emphasise meditation on the body, mindfuln"
ess on the body.  Separate the 
mind from all those bodily feelings that can so eas
"ily create tiredness, pain, heat, cold "
or sometimes even comfort.  See these feelings as t
"hey are, a play on that world "
outside. 
"If one is too attached to the body, then when it’s "
hot the mind is hot too.  When it’s 
cold the mind is just freezing.  When you’re tired 
the mind is tired.  When you’re 
energetic the mind is restless.  Sometimes there is
 just too much of a connection 
between the body and the mind and so when the world
 swings one way the mind 
swings with it.  We cannot control the world outsid
e.  We’ve been trying to do that for 
years.  I thought that if I were the abbot of a mon
astery I could control the situation in 
the monastery.  I can’t!  I admit to you in all hon
esty that the monastery is out of 
"control.  One can guide it, one can incline it in a"
" certain direction, but basically it’s "
73
out of control.  The monastery goes its own way acc
ording to the 
Dhamma
.  We 
understand that we cannot control the outside world
.  We can’t even control our own 
"bodies, let alone the monastery or other people’s b"
odies.  But we can ‘let go’.  Can 
you control your own body and get rid of all the ac
hes and the pains?  You can’t do 
that.  But often because of our delusion and our at
"tachments, because we think we "
"possess this body and this world, we get in there a"
"nd try to control, change, and "
manipulate things.  We are always thinking of ways 
to get our own way.  That’s the 
cause of suffering in this monastery.  Take it as i
"t is, especially until you get peace in "
your mind.  At this moment why can’t you accept it 
as it is? 
The moment is here.  It’s come.  You can’t change i
t.  Maybe the next moment might 
be 
"different, "
but 
this 
moment 
is 
just 
like 
this. 
T
his 
is 
why 
the 
whole 
path 
of 
Buddhism is to ‘let go’ of trying to change this mo
ment and instead develop a sense 
"of contentment.  In other words, let this moment be"
.  The only way you can let the 
moment be and not try and change it and control it 
is to find joy in the monastic life.  
Find joy in your duties.  The only way I can carry 
on talking like this is to actually put 
"happiness into it, to give it meaning, to give it v"
alue.  The only way I can work so 
"hard, is to give my work value and meaning, to give"
 it joy.  That’s the only way I can 
"meditate, by giving this moment joy and energy.  Th"
is is a practice that I have been 
doing for many years.  Realising that I cannot do j
"ust what I want to do, I do what I "
"have to do.  I make that happy, I give that joy.  I"
 invest joy in whatever I am doing.  
That’s been a training – not something that I was b
"orn with, but something that I have "
trained myself to do. 
"Give joy to whatever you have to do, whether it’s m"
oving bricks or it’s pushing a 
"wheel barrow, giving a talk or talking to some fool"
ish person who rings up late at 
night; whatever it is put joy into it.  Because tha
t joy goes straight against the fault 
"finding mind, the controlling mind, the negative mi"
nd that causes so much attachment 
"and so much suffering.  Whatever we’re doing, when "
we develop joy in the mind 
we’re going in the opposite direction to habit.  It
’s so easy to follow our habits of 
"mind and get upset, get depressed or give in to tir"
edness. 
I am reminded of Ajahn Chah with the presence here 
"of Ajahn Anek, one of Ajahn "
Chah’s senior disciples.  To just listen to him tal
k in Thai brings back all the old 
74
memories of Ajahn Chah’s teaching.  Ajahn Chah said
", “Don’t follow the moods in "
your mind.  If a mood comes up don’t get involved i
n it.  Don’t follow.  Don’t build it 
up. Don’t get attached to it”.  In other words just
 let it burn itself out. 
"We might have anger, but at least we’re not going t"
o push that wheel barrow along 
"and build the anger up.  If we get tired, that is j"
"ust bodily tired, that’s all.  If we get "
depressed don’t sink into that depression.  It’s ju
st a pit and it gives us so much 
suffering.  Don’t get into that depression; instead
 put joy into the mind.  Don’t believe 
in those moods.  When we believe in those moods we 
get attached to them; we believe 
we are upset.  We believe we’re tired or depressed.
"  Who is upset, who is tired and "
who is depressed?  Once we can actually detach from
 these moods they don’t occur.  
"Once there is not an ‘I’, how can there be someone "
"who is upset, someone who is "
depressed or someone who is angry? 
Let Go of the Past and the Future 
In Buddhism attachment is where we identify with th
"ese states, where we make a "
‘self’ out of them and become them.  This is how th
ey find a foothold inside of us.  
We can see all these things like physical tiredness
"; it’s just the body, that’s all.  That’s "
why the forest masters told us to just reflect upon
 the body.  Tiredness is part of 
having a body.  The older we get the more tired we 
get.  It is just a natural process.  
The energy that we have when we’re young is going t
o go.  We are never going to 
have that ‘oomph’ when we get into our fifties and 
we’re only going to drag ourselves 
around when we are in our seventies.  That’s just t
he nature of this body.  We have to 
get used to it.  We can’t fight it or control it.  
What we can do is realise that it’s just 
the body being tired. 
Sometimes when I go back to my hut at night my body
 is so tired.  I’ve been running 
"around all day doing things for people, and then I "
remember that teaching of the 
Buddha – I have great faith in the Buddha’s teachin
gs – ‘Even though the body is 
"sick, the mind doesn’t need to be sick.  Even thoug"
"h the body is tired, the mind "
doesn’t need to be tired’.  These are very powerful
 teachings!  Teachings like these 
"are great, because we are often tired physically bu"
t not mentally.  That is how we can 
cheer ourselves up.  Separate the mind from the bod
y and even though the body is 
"hurting, we just let it go, and follow the Buddha’s"
 teachings on meditation.  Let go of 
75
"the past and the future, and we’re just left with t"
he present moment.  Let go of the 
inner conversation.  That inner conversation is the
 worst thing we’re attached to.  We 
think ourselves into so much suffering! 
It would be a wonderful thing if we could just shut
 up inside and stop all of that 
‘proliferation of thoughts and ideas’.  The problem
 is we trust our thinking.  We think 
it’s 
so
 valuable.  Because we trust the views that are bui
"lt up from our thoughts, we "
get into so much difficulty and strife.  If you wan
t to believe in something believe in 
"silence.  If you want to be attached to anything, b"
e attached to that silence in the mind.  
Seek that out and make it a friend.  
"All lies are in words, all truth is in silence"
.  So we 
can see that if we listen to words they’re basicall
"y lies:  it’s not quite truth, it’s not "
"quite reality, it’s not quite accuracy, it is one s"
tage removed from truth.  We believe 
all those lies again and again and again.  How much
 suffering has that caused us?  We 
"don’t gain insight through thinking, we just gain h"
eadaches.  We just gain suffering.  
We just gain arguments.  We just gain confusion and
 depression.  That’s all we gain 
though thinking. 
"Follow the Buddha’s advice and be quiet, be calm.  "
The Buddhist word for a wise 
person is an 

", a "

"
"
", a silent sage.  There is wisdom in that silence. "
"That’s where we can start hearing the world, seeing"
" the world, feeling the world, "
knowing what’s going on.  So you are wise if you ar
e pushing wheel barrows with a 
silent mind.  Then it’s easy.  That reminds me of w
hen I was a student.  I don’t know 
how I got involved because I was never very athleti
"c, but going to a place like "
Cambridge they roped me into the boat club.  So for
 at least one year I was rowing in 
a boat along the river.  It was a crazy way to spen
d an afternoon because it was really 
"hard work.  I thought, ‘It’s just rowing on a nice "
afternoon in the sunshine.  It doesn’t 
matter how fast we go as long as we enjoy ourselves
’.  That was not what the coach 
thought.  The coach wanted us to go fast and beat t
he other teams.  I remember once 
during a race rowing as hard as I could and feeling
 a lot of physical pain.  The coach 
"shouted at me, “You’re scowling; smile and it won’t"
 hurt so much”.  It was true.  I 
"followed his advice and even though I was in pain, "
I put a smile on my face and half 
the pain disappeared.  I was able row on quite fast
.  It’s the same with whatever we’re 
doing in life.  We can put happiness into it or we 
can put pain into it. 
76
From our external experiences thoughts arise and pr
oliferate and we can create this 
"whole mass of suffering over what we are doing, or "
we can just shut up.  As we shut 
up we become more peaceful.  We realise this is jus
"t a physical body, sometimes it "
"hurts, "
sometimes 
it’s 
a 
"pleasure, "
sometimes 
it’s 
co
"mfortable, "
sometimes 
it’s 
a 
discomfort.  We can’t control it at all.  Wherever 
"we go in the world, however wealthy "
"or powerful we are, it’s always the same.  Now it’s"
" pleasurable, now it’s painful.  "
"Now it’s comfortable, now it’s uncomfortable.  Now "
we hear something nice that we 
"like to hear, now we hear something that we don’t l"
"ike to hear.  Now we see beauty, "
now you see ugliness.  Now we taste something that 
"is delicious, now we taste "
"something that is awful.  That’s life, sensory expe"
rience.  If we start thinking about 
that 
and 
try 
to 
find 
ways 
and 
means 
to 
get 
what 
we 
like 
– 
only 
the 
nice 
and 
"pleasurable, only the delicious food, only the mona"
stery we like – we find we can’t do 
that.  It’s impossible.  We’d be running around the
 whole world forever.  Ajahn Chah 
used to say that we’re searching for the tortoise w
ith the moustache.  Tortoises don’t 
have moustaches!  That’s why pleasure in the physic
al world won’t be found.  I’m 
"talking about permanent pleasure, permanent satisfa"
ction.  We only have moments of 
happiness. 
If 
something 
is 
causing 
you 
"suffering, "
it 
must 
be 
w
rong 
attitude 
or 
wrong 
understanding.  You’re looking at things in the inc
orrect way.  You’re not letting go.  
The whole purpose of this practice is to let go of 
the world of the body and the five 
senses. 
That 
means 
not 
just 
your
physical 
"body, "
but 
all 
physical 
bodies 
– 
the 
"monastery, the country, and the whole world.  Letti"
ng go of that means being able to 
close your eyes and just be silent.  Not allowing t
he experiences of the day to echo in 
your meditation.  The ability to let go of the past
 is such a fundamental aspect of this 
meditation.  Do you understand how you carry the pa
st into the present moment when 
you try to meditate?  How difficult that makes the 
meditation.  There is no good 
reason to carry the past into the present.  We don’
"t have to do that, its attachment "
"that’s all.  Its stupidity!  The past is gone, fini"
"shed, done with.  We can’t change it. "
Very often we look at the past with biased opinions
.  We seek out what happened in 
the past according to the emotions that are present
 in the mind now.  If we’re feeling 
"happy, great, we look at all the good things that h"
appened today.  If we’re in a bad 
mood we look at all the bad things that happened to
day.  The best way is not to look 
77
"at all.  Who can trust memory?  In meditation, it d"
oesn’t matter what we’ve just been 
doing.  If someone’s argued with us or called us st
"upid, or someone on the phone has "
"been talking foolish nonsense for a long time, just"
 let that go.  The next moment it’s 
gone.  The only way to meditate is by letting go an
d freeing yourself from the past.  
Do that at least while you’re staying at this monas
tery.  Get that degree of insight and 
"that degree of ability to cut off the past, even wh"
at happened a moment ago. 
Sometimes when I begin to meditate I haven’t got my
" wisdom faculty turned on, so "
the first part of the meditation is hopeless.  I’m 
thinking about the monastery or 
worrying about this or that.  But I always remember
 that at any moment in the 
meditation 
I 
can 
turn 
it 
around 
and 
turn 
a 
hopeless
meditation 
into 
a 
brilliant 
meditation by just letting go of the past.  When I 
"first began to meditate, if I started "
"with a rotten meditation I’d worry about it, and it"
 would carry on right through the 
whole hour.  I would carry the mistakes of the past
" into the present all the time, "
"thinking, ‘This is a rotten meditation’, or ‘I can’"
t meditate.  Why isn’t it working 
well?’  But the point was not ‘Why isn’t it working
 well’:  I came to realise that I was 
just lingering on attachments to the past.  This is
 why we have to learn how to let go 
"of the past if we want to be free, if we want to be"
" at peace, if we want to develop "
"meditation, especially deep states of meditation. "
Give It Everything You’ve Got 
I trained myself and I want you to train yourselves
", so that at any moment you can just "
"turn to the ‘present moment’ to be completely free,"
" even if you have great pain, "
"unsatisfactoriness, or difficulties.  If you can be"
 just there in the present moment then 
you find that you are completely free of everything
 that has happened.  You don’t 
even recall it; you’ve cut the mind off from what’s
 happened in the past.  It doesn’t 
matter if you’ve been wheel-barrowing earth for six
 or seven days for a reason you 
just cannot understand.  It doesn’t matter what you
 have been doing.  The wheel-
barrow that you are wheeling now is all that’s impo
"rtant.  Don’t go about saying, "
“Why am I doing this.  This isn’t what I became a m
onk for!”  You realise that is just 
causing you suffering.  Let go of all of the past a
nd stay in the present moment.  I let 
go of all the business that I see on my desk as I c
"lose my eyes before meditating, I "
don’t even worry about it.  I’m only a part time ab
bot.  It’s true.  When I do my work 
"I’m an abbot.  When I close my eyes, I’m not an abb"
ot; I’m a meditator in this present 
78
moment.  That’s the way I survive and that’s the wa
y you have to survive.  You’ve all 
got projects and things you have to do – difficulti
"es, responsibilities and pain in the "
body – but follow this advice and let go of the pas
t and the future.  Dwell in the 
present moment because that is the only place you c
an get some quietness. 
It doesn’t matter about all the mistakes you’ve mad
"e, all the errors you’ve made.  "
They are only problems and difficulties if you keep
 hanging on to them.  Let them go!  
Some people say you can’t do that unless you believ
e you can do it.  But 
you
 can do 
it!  Even 
"$&

ā
 
 (MN 86) with all his bad 
kamma
 became Enlightened in a very 
short time.  The only people who can’t let go are p
eople who have killed their mother 
or father in this life.  When you realise you can j
"ust let go in this way, you understand "
how to meditate.  You let go of your attachments to
" the past, you let go of your "
"attachment to this body.  If you can do this, then "
you know you are getting somewhere 
on this path.  
You can do this
! 
"If you can’t do this yet, then you have more traini"
ng to do.  You don’t have to go 
somewhere else to do it.  Everywhere else is basica
lly the same as here.  You have to 
"do this now, here in this moment.  There comes a ti"
me when you just stand your 
"ground and say, “"
'
", I’m not going to follow your tricks anymore!  Thi"
s is where 
I’m going to stand and do battle”.  Just do as the 
Buddha said:  let go of the past and 
"the future, let go of the thinking mind, be silent "
and watch the breath.  Just be with 
every breath.  “Why can’t I do that all the time?” 
 We make things so hard and 
complex and complicated.  It’s easy to watch the br
eath if you can let go of the past 
and the future.  Let go of the thinking mind.  Let 
go of controlling.  Don’t do it your 
"way, do it in the Buddha’s way.  Just watch the bre"
ath.  We can watch the breath in 
this moment.  That’s all we need to do.  It’s just 
a case of having the right attitude of 
detachment.  It’s easy then to watch the breath. 
The success of years of meditation is a sign of how
 much you have detached from the 
world.  If you can’t meditate it’s because there is
" some craving, some attachment "
there.  Put enjoyment into the breath in the same w
ay as you put enjoyment into 
"sweeping up leaves.  As Ajahn Chah used to say, “Gi"
ve it everything you’ve got no 
matter what you’re doing”.  Brushing your teeth giv
"e it everything you’ve got, make it "
"a very good job.  Pushing the wheel-barrow, make it"
 a beautiful job.  Do the best you 
79
"can.  Give it full attention every moment, that’s h"
ow you watch the breath.  Give 
yourself completely to the breath.  Complete surren
der to the breath.  It doesn’t matter 
"what your body is doing, how early or how late it i"
"s, how hot or how cold it is, just be "
with the breath for a few moments.  If you can do t
"his and follow the instructions, you "
will find it is the easiest thing in the world to w
atch the breath.  It’s easy if you are 
"detached, if you can let go.  So find that way of l"
"etting go, train yourself to let go.  "
When you’re watching the breath it’s the last part 
of the body that you’re still attached 
"to.  And if you continue just watching the breath, "
"being with the breath, the mind "
"becomes so bright, so beautiful and it becomes appa"
rent that it’s a natural process. 
In the Footsteps of the Buddha 
Enjoy 
the 
meditation 
and 
the 
meditation 
becomes 
fun
. 
That’s 
because 
you 
are 
beginning to let go of the world.  The longer you c
an let go of the world the more that 
enjoyment and pleasure increases.  Meditate for fiv
"e minutes, it feels good.  I’m "
"talking about real meditation, watching the breath,"
 not messing around and thinking.  
If you can watch the breath for five minutes at eas
"e in the moment, just being with the "
"breath, not controlling, it becomes peaceful, and i"
f you can continue that for an hour it 
becomes very delightful.  The longer you maintain t
"he attention on the breath, the "
"more the mind grows in happiness, grows in energy, "
grows in contentment.  It’s the 
build up of 
samadhi
 that’s all.  As you build up that 
samadhi
" on the breath, bliss takes "
"over.  If you’re patient enough, don’t interfere an"
"d don’t try and control it, it becomes "
the ‘beautiful breath’. 
The ‘beautiful breath’ is just the nature of the br
eath at this particular stage.  If you 
can get to this stage it means you’ve detached from
 so much.  You’ve detached from 
"the world long enough, let go of the world long eno"
"ugh, for the mind to start to "
brighten up the consciousness.  What happens next i
"s that, from that brightness, as it "
grows more and more and more into the ‘beautiful br
"eath’, the breath disappears.  "
You’re just left with the ‘beautiful’ and the beaut
iful turns into a beautiful 
Citta
", "
which is the reflection of the mind.  That shows th
at you’ve let go of even more.  It’s 
"a sign of detachment from the world, a sign of lett"
"ing go, a sign that wisdom is "
starting to manifest.  If you can go into that 
Citta
 you can also go into a 
jhana
.  
You are re-experiencing the footsteps of the Buddha
.  These are the signs of letting 
80
"go, it’s called "
#
"
"
", because it is the happiness born of renunciation."
Renunciation is just another word for letting go. 
If you can’t go into a 
Citta
 or a 
jhana
 that means that you still have a lot more 
‘letting go’ to do.  It means there are still attac
hments and delusions there.  You still 
haven’t seen what needs to be done or how to do it.
"  So be humble, don’t be proud, "
and don’t follow your own ideas.  If you can’t get 
into these deep states it means there 
is something you haven’t seen yet.  See if you can 
"do some more ‘letting go’, some "
more renunciation.  Have trust in the practice of t
"he forest teachers, these are the "
"people who do become Enlightened, who do get "
samadhi
", who do get "
jhanas
.  This is 
the path for overcoming the attachments.  Only afte
r you have entered into those 
jh
ā
nas
" and emerged have you got the basic data, the exper"
ience of pure mind and the 
experience of seeing things cease.  Only then have 
you got the opportunity and chance 
to really see the three characteristics.  You have 
to achieve those 
jhanas
 for yourself! 
Without these experiences you haven’t yet learned e
nough to see 

", "
"dukkha"
 and 
Metta
.  That is why you need to have these experiences s
ooner or later.  Only when 
"you’ve ‘let go’ that much, can you really understan"
d what ‘letting go’ is.  If you 
haven’t been able to get into 
jhanas
 yet it means you still have attachments.  You 
"haven’t seen, let alone untied the attachments.  Th"
"ere are still cravings, and there are "
still illusions.  Illusions are overcome by seeing 
how everything works through a 
"widening perspective, through seeing things from a "
different standpoint.  That’s the 
whole point of the 
jhanas
", they give you a different perspective, a differen"
"t standpoint, "
a place from which to look upon the world with such
 obvious clarity and see 

", "
"dukkha"
 and 
Metta
.  You can’t see them without that experience.  Peo
ple look in the 
suttas
 to try and find ways of getting around this but th
ey always end with the last 
"factor of the Eightfold Path, which is the four "
jhanas
.  That’s not just said once in the 
"suttas"
", it’s said many, many times.  You just have to do "
this! 
"So don’t be proud, don’t be stubborn, just give you"
rself up to the teaching of the 
"Buddha, to the Eightfold Path.  Don’t think too muc"
h.  Don’t try and work it all out 
"intellectually.  Just unbind (let go) of yourself, "
and get some silence in the mind.  
Don’t waste the opportunities you have.  It doesn’t
 matter what you have been doing 
81
"in the morning, afternoon or evening, when you’re m"
editating don’t let the past hinder 
your progress.  That’s the only way to release your
self.  Once you can do these things 
you will see the 
Dhamma
" for yourself.  It’s not just theory, it’s also exp"
eriences.  You 
know what attachment is because you can detach your
self.  You can experience it as a 
"process, not just as an idea.  You know what lettin"
g go is because you’ve experienced 
it.  You know what freedom is because you’ve experi
enced that freedom.  You know 
"what the Buddha’s mind is like, because you have ex"
perienced the same thing.  You 
know how this whole process works.  You’ve let go o
f so much that there is only a 
tiny bit more to let go of.  If you can’t let go of
" that last bit, a least you’ve let go of so "
much that you should at least be an

We need more of those kinds of monks in the world. 
 We don’t need more monks 
building monasteries.  We don’t need more monks wri
ting books or translating books.  
We need more monks who can give talks from their ow
n experiences.  We need more 
monks who are

monks 
who are


", and what Venerable Anuruddha experienced.  This "
Buddhism is not just an historical point of interes
t; it is alive with the re-experiencing 
of all the facets of the 
Dhamma
".  So let go of your attachments, have confidence a"
nd 
faith.  It can be done! 
There was a novice who saw a man training an elepha
"nt and he thought, ‘If a man can "
"train a wild elephant, surely I can train my mind’."
  You’re much smaller than an 
elephant and you’re not as stubborn as a wild eleph
ant.  So if a man can train a wild 
"elephant to do whatever he wants, surely you can tr"
ain your own mind?  To train your 
"mind don’t give in to it, don’t follow its moods an"
d don’t follow its stupidity.  Just 
train the mind.  Don’t go with the stream of your i
"deas, and thoughts, and delusions.  "
Go against that stream.  Be rebellious against your
 instincts and cravings. 
"If someone says, “You can’t do this”, I say, “Why?”"
  When I was a kid if someone put 
"a sign on a park bench saying ‘Don’t Touch’, I woul"
d touch it out of spite.  It didn’t 
82
matter if I got paint on my hand or I got into trou
ble.  Using that rebelliousness in the 
Dhamma
", if I’m too tired to meditate, I check it out anyw"
ay. 
One of my most interesting meditations was when I h
ad typhus fever.  You’re not 
supposed to be able get into deep meditation when y
ou have typhus fever because you 
have no energy at all.  This was in the hospital in
" Ubon, Thailand, twenty-four years "
"ago.  The first day I was there, at six o’clock in "
the afternoon the nurse disappeared.  I 
"asked the monk next to me, “When is the night nurse"
 coming on?” – “Night nurse?” 
"he said, “There is no night nurse.  If you die at n"
ight that’s bad luck; there is only a 
nurse during the daytime”.  I don’t know if you cou
"ld really call them nurses, they "
were really tough and not at all sensitive. 
I remember having to go to the toilet.  There were 
no bed pans:  I had to lurch from 
one bed to the next one and then hold on until I go
t enough energy to lurch to the next 
bed.  I had to hold on because I had no strength at
" all, and my head was dizzy.  When "
I finally got to the toilet I stayed there as long 
as possible to make sure that everything 
"was out, because I didn’t want to go through that e"
xperience again for a few hours.  I 
was very weak and no one was helping me.  I remembe
"r feeling so rotten and terrible, "
"so weak and so sick and so depressed, after being i"
n hospital for a couple of weeks 
with typhus fever.  There was no care of any sort. 
 And then I got so rebellious!  I 
"thought, ‘So what!  I’m going to watch my breath’. "
 Now you’re not supposed to be 
"able to do that, it’s supposed to be impossible whe"
n you’re so sick.  But I just watched 
my breath and got into a nice deep meditation.  It 
was wonderful; it was the best part 
"of being in hospital, the best part of the typhus f"
ever.  Being able to meditate and get 
"into deep meditation, just getting ‘blissed out’ in"
 that way was great. 
That experience taught me how much the body lies.  
"The body said, ‘You can’t "
"meditate now’, but I called its bluff.  Sometimes I"
 could even meditate when in great 
pain.  You can do it if you believe you can.  It’s 
always been a part of my practice to 
be completely rebellious.  When someone tells me I 
"can’t, I ask, “Why not?” "
Hopefully this will be an encouragement to each one
" of you.  If it’s late, it doesn’t "
"matter.  If you feel tired and so sleepy, it doesn’"
"t matter.  If you’re really sick, it "
"doesn’t matter.  Just go against the stream, go aga"
"inst the accepted ideas, and liberate "
83
yourself from all that’s happened in the past.  The
" last moment I was tired, but what "
"about this moment.  This is how you can practise, h"
"ow you can let go of attachments, "
"how you can free yourself, and how you can discover"
 the wonder and supremacy of 
the mind.  The mind is the forerunner of all things
.  It’s the most powerful of all 
things.  You create your own suffering.  You can cr
eate your own liberation.  So it’s 
all up to you!

6  THE OPENING OF THE LOTUS 
3
rd
 May 2000 
This is the first talk I have given since teaching 
the annual nine-day retreat for the 
local lay Buddhists.  I always have a wonderful tim
e on those retreats.  It is a time 
"when all my attention is focussed on meditation, an"
d on the 
Dhamma
.  One of the 
things that became very clear to me on that retreat
 was that there is no difference 
between the 
Dhamma
 and meditation.  One should incorporate as much 
Dhamma
 as 
possible into the way one meditates.  If you can in
corporate all your understanding of 
the 
Dhamma
" into the meditation, then this is a very powerful "
and effective way to 
gain the goal in Buddhism. 
I find it’s not possible to separate these two thin
gs.  Thinking that meditation is 
"somehow separate from the teaching of the Buddha, o"
r that the teachings of the 
Buddha are somehow separate from the meditation pra
"ctice, will not lead to success.  "
The Dhamma and meditation go together so beautifull
y.  One of the things I taught 
regularly to the lay meditators during the retreat 
"was, ‘When you are meditating "
remember the basic teachings of the Buddha!’ 
The Teflon Mind 
Keep the 
Dhamma
 in mind as you are meditating; particularly keep i
n mind the Four 
Noble Truths as an indication of what you should be
 doing when you are meditating.  
In particular I focussed their attention on the sec
ond and third noble truths.  The 
second noble truth is craving or more especially 
kama
tanha
", the craving for the five-"
"sense world, the craving to be, which includes the "
"craving to do, and the craving for "
annihilation.  These invariably lead to 
"dukkha"
", to suffering. "
So how can you expect to become peaceful or get int
o a deep meditation when you 
are following 
the 
path of 
the 
second 
noble 
truth? 
You 
can 
only 
get 
into 
deep 
"meditation if you remember the third noble truth, w"
"hich is the ending of that craving, "
the path to 
!!
.  The path to 
!!
" is the path to the highest bliss, the highest "
"peace, and it is achieved through "
&
	&&
"
"
 
.  These four 
Pali
words mean giving up.  
-&
" is giving away, "
	&&
" is renouncing, forfeiting, "
85
"
"
 is releasing and 
 
 is not letting anything find a roosting place in y
our 
"mind, not having a place where things can stick.  I"
" told someone this evening that, "
“With a ‘Teflon mind’ the thoughts and ideas don’t 
"stick, they just slip away”. "
With 
these 
Dhamma
teachings 
in 
the 
mind 
it 
becomes 
very 
easy 
to 
succ
eed 
in 
meditation.  You understand what you are doing and 
that helps the meditation.  You 
begin 
to 
understand 
what 
it 
is 
you 
are 
doing 
that 
i
s 
obstructing 
success 
in 
the 
meditation.  As far as this meditation is concerned
", if you really practise the third "
"noble truth, if you really do let go without except"
"ion, freely opening up and not "
"having a place where things can stick in the mind, "
you will find the mind opens up 
and becomes very peaceful and quiet.  The mind goes
 through the stages of meditation 
all the way into the 
jhanas
.  It’s the natural unfolding of the peaceful mind.
"So often when we’re practising our meditation, we a"
re following the second noble 
"truth instead, that is craving.  It is concern for "
"things in the world, and thoughts about "
the past and the future.  It is thoughts about fami
"ly, thoughts about our health; "
"thoughts about our comfort and our bodies, thoughts"
 about the sounds that other 
"people are making, thoughts about heat and cold, th"
oughts about what you’re going to 
"do tomorrow, thoughts about when you are going to d"
"o it, and where you are going to "
go.  All of those thoughts are the concerns of the 
five-sense world.  In 
Pali
 they are 
kama
tanha
":  craving for comfort, for satisfaction, for fulfi"
"lment, for success in the "
world of the five senses. 
We should know now from our own experience and thro
ugh the 
Dhamma
 – the 
"teachings of the Buddha, the four noble truths – th"
at this concern is not the way of 
"peace, of happiness, or of release in one’s meditat"
ion.  It will only produce more 
"suffering, more frustration, more disappointment, a"
nd more pain in the mind.  This is 
what is meant by ‘cause and effect’.  We know where
 this path will lead us if we 
follow it.  So we should know that whenever there i
"s pain, frustration, or despair in "
the mind we have to work back to find the craving w
hich is the cause.  Learn from 
your mistakes.  Learn from the wrong attitudes of t
he mind.  Don’t be foolish and 
"generate suffering, suffering, suffering, for your "
"whole life and through many lives, "
"through many world cycles.  Don’t be stupid, learn "
"from experience.  If it’s suffering, "
86
"if it’s despair, frustration, disappointment, or wh"
"atever, it is something to do with the "
first noble truth.  The craving to be always comes 
"from the illusion of self, "
Metta
.  
People often have very strong egos and a very stron
g sense of self from pride.  They 
are the ones who find it very difficult to meditate
. 
"Sometimes one needs to develop humility, the abilit"
y to surrender.  I notice that 
people who have enormous faith are usually the ones
 who have an easier time doing 
the meditation.  They get into deep states of medit
ation 
because of faith in the 
teaching and faith in a teacher.  Faith in the Budd
ha is something that overcomes faith 
"in ones ego.  Everyone has some sort of faith, some"
" sort of belief, but so often it is "
"belief in oneself; in one’s own wisdom, in one’s ow"
"n intelligence, in ones own "
knowledge and that very often obstructs the progres
s on the path. 
When I teach retreats I often see this.  Some of th
e Asian meditators are able to go far 
"deeper in their meditation, because generally speak"
"ing they trust what a monk says, "
"they don’t argue with it, they don’t think twice ab"
"out it, they just do it.  They follow "
the 
instructions and 
it works. 
In 
contrast 
many 
We
sterners 
are 
so 
"independent, "
"basically so conceited and arrogant, that sometimes"
 we don’t want to follow what the 
"teacher says, or what the Buddha says.  We want to "
find out in our own way what we 
think must be right.  When one is not yet a Stream 
Winner that belief in ones own 
"ideas and views is very uncertain, it creates so mu"
"ch of a burden, so much of an "
obstacle in your monastic life.  Be careful what yo
u put your faith in.  As you know 
faith or 

","
" is one of the five spiritual qualities, the five "
Indriyas
.
  It’s very 
important to have faith at the beginning of your pr
actice because you haven’t grown 
in 
Panna
", in wisdom yet.  When one has gained wisdom, then "
that faith is confirmed.  
You are stronger in the faith because you have seen
 that truth for yourself.  Ajahn 
Chah used to say that when you have been a monk for
 five years you have five per 
"cent of wisdom.  Someone asked, “Does that mean whe"
n you have four years as a 
"monk that you have four per cent wisdom?”  He said,"
" “No, when you’ve got four "
years you’ve got zero wisdom”.  What he said was ve
ry wise:  if you’ve got zero 
wisdom you have to accept it and do as you are told
.  Trust in Ajahn Chah and you’ll 
go much further than if you trust in yourself.  I’v
"e seen that degree of faith, that "
"degree of surrender, in some of the Asian meditator"
s and because of that they follow 
87
instructions without question. 
It’s amazing that with some Westerners things often
 go wrong with the tools and 
equipment they buy because they don’t read the inst
ructions before they plug in and 
start using them.  That’s the arrogance of people t
hese days; they think that they are so 
superior; they think they know it all.  They have f
aith in their own abilities and that’s 
why they are always falling on their faces.  A pers
on who truly has faith would read 
"the instructions, understand those instructions, an"
d if there were any questions would 
read it again until they understood the instruction
"s, and then they would proceed.  "
The 
"instructions are very clear, craving leads to suffe"
"ring, letting go leads to peace"
. 
So what do people do when they try to meditate?  Th
ey crave to get peaceful.  They 
"work hard to get peaceful, they strive, and they sc"
rew their minds up to get peaceful.  
"And then they just get frustrated and think, ‘I can"
’t meditate’.  It’s true that 
you
 can’t 
meditate.  No 
Metta
", no ‘self’, can do the meditation:  you have got t"
o get out of the 
way.  Put the ‘
I
’ aside and then you find that meditation happens. 
 You can’t do 
meditation; you’ve got to just get out of the way f
or meditation to occur.  It’s a whole 
process and that’s precisely what the second noble 
truth means.  It was amazing to see 
in the retreat how stubborn people are.  They will 
always try and do things. 
One of the most powerful methods of meditation that
 I practise is ‘contentment’.  I 
don’t teach things and then do something else; all 
of the methods that I teach are the 
methods I practise myself.  Contentment means being
" happy to be here, wherever you "
are.  The reason contentment works is because it’s 
going against the second noble 
truth and it’s fulfilling the third noble truth. 
You have to be careful of ‘contentment’ because it 
doesn’t mean being content to 
follow the cravings and the 

 qualities of the mind.  It’s a different type of 
contentment.  I always know when it’s real ‘content
ment’ because I don’t move.  If I 
was not content then I would always be looking for 
happiness somewhere else.  That’s 
the opposite of contentment.  Discontent causes res
"tlessness, causes movement of the "
"mind, and causes craving, reaching out and trying t"
o find something else to feed the 
needs of the mind.  If its discontent you get 
kama
chanda
", sensual desire, the first "
88
"hindrance.  You want to find some better comfort, s"
omething happier and more 
"pleasant, you want to get rid of the pain in the bo"
dy.  
)
chanda
comes from 
"discontent.  Discontent is ill will, it is not bein"
"g happy with the meditation, with "
yourself or with anybody else. 
From discontent people often go into sloth and torp
"or just to escape, because they "
can’t face the present moment or the present life. 
 One extra hour in bed in the 
morning means one hour less you have to meditate or
 one hour less you have to face 
"the cold world.  Restlessness, worry, or remorse ar"
"e obviously discontent, doubt is "
"discontent, as is the desire to know, to figure thi"
ngs out.  Shut up and be peaceful!  
You 
know 
everything 
you 
need 
to 
know. 
All 
the 
five
hindrances 
are 
born 
of 
discontent.  In the Nalakap

na Sutta (MN 68) it says that only when you achieve
 the 
jhanas
" are the five hindrances, and interestingly discont"
ent and weariness overcome.  
It’s interesting in that 
"
"
 to see that the Buddha linked the five hindrances 
and 
"discontent, and how the five hindrances plus discon"
"tent give rise to weariness, and "
heaviness in the body.  Weariness makes it so hard 
to drag yourself out of bed in the 
"morning, out from under those nice warm covers. "
"If our meditation is going well, if we have overcom"
"e the five hindrances, we have "
energy and the heaviness of the body disappears.  D
uring the retreat it was often hard 
"for me to stop skipping around the place, because w"
hen you are enjoying yourself you 
want to get up earlier and earlier.  That’s just th
e way of the body and the mind.  
When the mind has energy it is no longer weary.  Di
scontent is at the heart of the five 
"hindrances, and it’s also at the heart of the secon"
d noble truth. 
From discontent craving arises.  So check your medi
"tation.  Ask yourself, ‘Am I "
"content where I am, or do I really want to get quic"
kly into a 
jhana
?’  ‘Do I really want 
to get quickly through the next stages?’  ‘Do I rea
lly want to get quickly through this 
talk and get somewhere else?’  Be careful of discon
tent because it causes so much 
"restlessness, so much inner activity and thinking. "
 I’ve noticed before that if I’m 
listening to a beautiful talk it brings me so much 
happiness.  I’m silent inside because 
"I don’t need to speak, because the talk is so beaut"
iful.  I’m just listening to it and 
"getting high, having a wonderful time.  But if we d"
"on’t like the talk, or discontent "
89
"comes into the mind, then we start thinking, fantas"
"ising, dreaming, or falling asleep.  "
Discontent has moved us away from what is happening
.  We all make use of escape 
mechanisms that we’ve stupidly built up over lifeti
"mes rather than face the present, "
rather than face what’s happening now.  We are alwa
ys trying to run away; that’s 
restlessness.  That habit can very easily manifest 
in our meditation:  instead of facing 
"up to what’s happening, and developing contentment "
"in the moment, people run away.  "
"They run away into thinking, philosophising, dreami"
"ng, and fantasising.  That’s not "
the way to meditate.  That’s the second noble truth
 and it only leads to suffering.  You 
should know that by now. 
Following the Instructions 
Follow the third noble truth of letting go.  When w
e say 
&
" or generosity, we are "
"giving up and abandoning; that means surrendering, "
"forsaking, "
	&&
.  What do 
we have to forsake?  We have to forsake our old vie
"ws, ideas and conceits.  This is "
hard to do because we are so stubborn.  One of the 
"monks, sitting in with me during "
"the retreat interviews, asked me, “Why do you think"
 it is that people come on retreat 
"and get all these good results, when sometimes monk"
"s at the monastery, can meditate "
for years and not even experience a 
Citta
?”  Some of the people on retreat lead 
very busy lives.  They don’t have much time to medi
"tate, certainly not as much as the "
monks and 
&
.  In the monastery you only have to do two hours w
ork on five 
"days of the week, whereas these people work forty, "
"fifty, or sixty hours a week, plus "
all the other business they have to do.  In those n
ine days of meditation it was 
amazing 
to 
see 
how 
many 
of 
them 
achieved 
decent 
med
itations 
and 
even 
had 
Citta
" arise.  So I said, “It’s because some of the monks"
 are stubborn” and that’s 
quite true.  Sometimes instead of just listening an
"d following the instructions, so often "
we want to make our own instructions. 
Instead of listening to what the Buddha said we wan
t to interpret it to suit our own 
ideas.  That’s the stubbornness in Westerners.  

nd I can understand it because you 
have to be stubborn to become monks in the first pl
ace.  You have to go against the 
"stream of the world to become a monk, so that stubb"
ornness is sometimes inherent in 
"monks.  Nevertheless, if one uses one’s intelligenc"
e and experience to overcome that 
"stubbornness – to just be happy with simple duties,"
 to renounce and to let go – then 
90
you can get into deep meditation.  But you have to 
renounce and let go stage by stage. 
That’s why I teach meditation in stages.  Let go of
" the past and the future, just be in "
the 
present. 
By 
the 
simple 
process 
of 
being 
in 
the
present 
"moment, "
so 
much 
"restlessness, so much thinking, and so much of the "
craving stops.  I’m not only saying 
this about a novice meditation or a preliminary med
itation – if I were to say things 
"like that people would think, “Oh, I’m much more ad"
"vanced than that, I’m going to do "
the deeper meditation not ‘present moment awareness
"’, that’s kids stuff.”  I still do "
present moment awareness meditation myself.  I empl
oy it at all stages of meditation. 
It's wonderful how powerful it is. 
On the retreat I also taught 
#&&
citta
","
 this mind that has gone to one peak of 
"being; one peak in space, one point in space.  Inst"
"ead of looking at it that way, look at "
this meditation of 
#&&
citta
 as being one peak or one point in time.  Focus not
 in 
"space but in this moment in time, centred in the pe"
"ak of this moment, right in the "
middle of past and future.  If you look at 
#&&
 as one-pointedness in time you will 
get much deeper in your meditation.  You will reall
y understand what this meditation 
is 
all 
about 
rather 
than 
have 
some 
sort 
of 
spacious
awareness 
or 
focusing 
your 
attention 
on 
the 
‘tip’ 
of 
something. 
This 
is 
where
you 
can 
get 
into 
beautiful 
"contentment, just by being in the moment. "
If 
you 
are 
fully 
aware 
in 
the 
"moment, "
silence 
emerg
es 
from 
within 
the 
present 
moment.  You don’t need to go looking for something
" else, or move on to the next "
stage of meditation; you move 
into
 the next stage of meditation or rather 
the next 
stage of the meditation moves into you
.  But watch it:  if you ‘let go’ you will 
experience 
mutti
", which means freeing, opening up.  The Buddha said"
 that as a teacher 
he 
had 
a 
"
"
"fist, "
an 
open 
"fist, "
he 
didn’t 
keep 
anything 
secret
. 
One 
way 
to 
understand what that P

"li word means is, instead of gripping the meditatio"
n object in 
"your fist, you just open it up.  That’s "
"
"
", that’s release, that’s openness.  That’s the "
reason when people open themselves up to the breath
", to the silence or to the present "
moment.  They begin to get some understanding of th
e third noble truth. 
"You are not controlling, you are not manipulating, "
and you are not doing so much 
91
"anymore.  All that controlling, manipulating, doing"
", is part of the craving to be.  "
"Craving is born of the illusion of ‘mine’, mine to "
"control, and mine to order.  Leave "
"all that alone – that only leads to suffering, to p"
"ain, to more discontent, more craving "
and suffering.  It’s a vicious cycle that we can ge
"t into.  Discontent producing craving, "
craving producing 
"dukkha"
", suffering, and suffering and discontent produces "
more 
craving.  It’s so hard to let go!  Once you find th
"e ‘let go button’, you will find that in "
the present moment silence just emerges from within
. 
The Buddha used the simile of cool water for the 
jhanas
.  Cool water doesn’t come 
"from the North, South, East or West of the lake; it"
 comes from within a spring in the 
"middle of the lake, drenching the pool with this be"
autiful cool water.  That simile 
applies to all stages of the meditation.  You just 
have to stay in the present moment 
and this beautiful silence wells up from within tha
"t experience, within that moment, "
within 
that 
mind; 
it 
comes 
from 
within 
and 
cools 
ev
erything 
"down, "
it 
makes 
everything so silent. 
Skilful meditators have the experience that 
they
" don’t make the mind silent, the "
silence just arrives.  You will find that you canno
t make the mind silent; ‘you’ cannot 
do that.  I can’t meditate to gain silence; the ‘
I
’ has to go away.  Silence comes in its 
own 
time. 
When 
you 
are 
"ready, "
when 
you’ve 
settled 
down 
"enough, "
not 
doing 
"anything, then "
"
"
 means that the claws of the mind have opened up en
ough so that 
the silence can come in.  Then in that silence – if
 you wait long enough – the breath 
"will arise, especially if you have done meditation "
on the breath before. 
Doing Less and Less 
"As a young monk, I always tried very hard to watch "
the breath.  When I first came to 
"Perth, I wasn’t as skilled as I am now with breath "
meditation:  I would watch the 
breath for forty-five minutes with great difficulty
; it was just too hard to keep the 
attention on the breath.  But then I developed the 
"‘letting go’ meditation, saying to "
myself ‘just let go’.  As soon as I did ‘letting go
 meditation’ the breath appeared very 
easily and I could watch it for the next half-hour 
or so if I wanted to.  It really struck 
me that by trying to focus on the breath I had diff
"iculty, but if I just let go and didn’t "
"care what came up in my mind, the breath was right "
there.  The breath was easy to 
92
hold in the mind’s eye and I was still.  It showed 
me that it’s often hard to watch the 
"breath if you try too much.  When you are trying, t"
hat’s craving – craving to be or to 
do something – and that leads to suffering.  You ca
n’t get success in meditation that 
way. 
If 
only 
I’d 
realised 
and 
kept 
the 
four 
noble 
truths 
in 
mind 
when 
I 
was 
"meditating, I wouldn’t have wasted so much time.  I"
 would have just been peaceful.  
"When we’re letting go, contented, and silent, the b"
"reath arises within the silence, as if "
the breath is just there.  We don’t have to force t
"he mind onto it, we don’t have to "
"control it, we don’t have to worry about where we a"
re going to watch the breath – at 
"the nose, at the stomach – we don’t have to worry a"
bout what we should do with the 
breath.  The breath just comes by itself when it’s 
ready and we’re just sitting there 
watching it.  The whole process of meditation is to
 try and do less and less.  Try and 
do more of 
&
	&&
"
"
","
just allowing the mind to open up. 
The other simile that I have used before is a lotus
 opening its petals.  Just imagine a 
lotus opening up petal by petal.  The outer petals 
are ‘present moment awareness’.  
"They reveal the next layer of petals, which reveals"
" the next layer of petals, which is "
"called the ‘breath’, and that reveals the next peta"
"ls, the ‘beautiful breath’.  As you go "
"into a lotus the petals get softer and softer, more"
 refined and fragrant.  You are getting 
closer to the heart of the lotus.  That’s just the 
way it is – you don’t need to move onto 
another lotus to get to the next stage of the medit
ation.  If you throw away this lotus 
"that has already opened up so much, to try and get "
"to the next stage, all you get is a "
lotus which hasn’t opened up at all.  If you want t
o move from the ‘breath’ to the 
"‘beautiful breath’ quickly, and if you throw away t"
"he breath, you just get a restless "
mind and you can’t even stay in the present moment.
  Do this stage by stage making 
"the mind as cool and as still as possible, being ca"
reful that craving doesn’t come in. 
If craving does come in don’t give it a place to st
"ay, don’t give the chicken a place to "
roost.  The chicken is a great symbol for craving. 
 Just leave it!  When it hasn’t got a 
"place to settle down, any moment of craving will ju"
st disappear straight away and 
nothing will stick to the mind.  So you’re just wat
"ching the breath, making the mind "
"non-sticky, making it free and open.  It’s just a m"
atter of time before that breath turns 
into a very beautiful and calm breath.  It calms do
wn by itself if you get out of the 
"way, because that’s the nature of things. "
93
Once the beautiful breath appears the whole process
 just happens in spite all of your 
"plans, intentions, manipulations, and control.  Whe"
ther you think you can meditate or 
"you think you can’t, you think you want to or you d"
"on’t want to, whether you’re "
afraid of 
jhanas
 or you’re not afraid of 
jhanas
", whatever happens it’s just a process.  "
"And as long as you don’t interfere with it, it take"
s you all the way into 
jhanas
.  When 
the beautiful breath comes up it gives you a sense 
of 

", the joy of meditation. "
Many monks know that beautiful 
"
"
", I forget its name now but I think it’s in the "
"$&
"

", where it says that once "

" arises in the mind, the monk no longer "
"needs to make the determination, resolution, or cho"
"ice, ‘May I now experience the "
tranquillity of body and mind’.  The Buddha said it
"’s a natural process, it has to "
happen.  It’s a natural consequence for one whose m
ind experiences joy that their 
body 
and 
mind 
will 
experience 
tranquillity. 
It’s 
a
natural 
experience 
once 
the 
"‘beautiful breath’ comes up, that the body is light"
" and peaceful.  The mind, instead of "
running around all over the place and having this i
"rritating restlessness, becomes "
"tranquil, still and peaceful.  The Buddha said that"
" for one whose mind is tranquil, "
there 
is 
no 
need 
to 
make 
the 
"resolution, "
‘May 
happi
ness 
appear 
in 
my 
mind’.  
Happiness naturally has to happen.  It is an automa
tic process in one whose body and 
"mind is tranquil that happiness, "
"
"
", arises! "
"So you just watch this happening, you just stay wit"
h the breath and it turns into a 
beautiful breath all by itself.  
"
"
", happiness, arises in the mind; the lotus is "
opening up.  You don’t need to rush the process; ru
"shing the process is craving, which "
leads to suffering.  We are opening up to the proce
"ss, giving up, and letting go.  The "
Buddha continued by saying that for one whose mind 
experiences 
"
"
", happiness, "
"there is no need to make a resolution, to determine"
", to manipulate, force or even "
"choose, ‘May my mind experience "
samadhi
’
.  For one in whose mind there is this 
"happiness, their mind enters "
samadhi
".  It’s a natural course, it’s automatic.  It’s a "
process that just happens. 
This is a very powerful and beautiful teaching of t
he Buddha.  It is saying that if we 
"try, it doesn’t work, if we let go it works.  If we"
 crave it’s just more suffering and we 
"can’t get into these beautiful, blissful states.  T"
hey are not stages of craving but stages 
94
"of letting go, not stages of attachment but stages "
of renunciation.  They’re actually 
"putting into practise the teachings of the Buddha, "
the four noble truths.  It’s doing 
what the Buddha said to do and experiencing the res
"ults, not as a theory but in our "
own bare experience.  
Samadhi
arises from the beautiful breath
.  The mind starts to 
"become still, sustaining its attention, because it "
is satisfied. 
We notice that the mind needs some satisfaction.  I
f it does not get that satisfaction in 
the 
meditation 
it 
will 
seek 
satisfaction 
in 
the 
com
pany 
of 
others. 
It 
will 
seek 
satisfaction by looking for projects to do.  It wil
l seek satisfaction in writing books.  It 
"will seek satisfaction, eventually, in disrobing.  "
The mind seeks satisfaction if we 
don’t give it happiness; in meditation the mind wil
l always go somewhere else.  So 
the only way to keep the mind still is through the 
satisfaction of 
"
"
", that stillness, "
that sustained attention of the mind which is calle
d 
samadhi
.  This is where 
"
"
 and 
samadhi
" work together, folding around each other, supporti"
ng each other. 
The mind begins to sustain its attention effortless
"ly, as a natural process, and the "
happiness increases.  It is like the happiness of b
eing released from a very demanding 
boss at work.  It’s the happiness of being released
" from debt, released from sickness, "
"released from jail, having found one’s way through "
a desert.  It is release from the five 
hindrances.  This is the sort of happiness that sta
rts to come up in the meditation and 
that happiness leads to more 
samadhi
", more ‘staying with what’s going on’.  When the "
breath starts to become ‘beautiful’ there is no mor
"e in-breath, there is no more out-"
"breath, there is just breath.  The meditation objec"
"t is becoming more and more refined, "
more and more simple.  There is just the continuous
" feeling, or rather the one feeling "
"of this moment.  You are so focused in this moment,"
 so 
#&&
", one-pointed in time, "
that there is just the feeling.  You know it’s the 
"breath beginning, the breath ending, "
"the middle, the end, in-or out-breath, but it all f"
eels the same.  It is just breath! 
That’s what I mean by the ‘beautiful breath one-poi
"nted in time’, just one experience "
only.  From that stage 
Citta
 well up from within.  At times people have a 
problem at this stage of the meditation:  should we
 stay with the 
Citta
 or should 
we return to the breath?  Sometimes the best thing 
to do is just to remember the 
"metaphor of all these things rising from within, li"
ke the cool spring of water welling 
95
up from within the lake in which you are now.  Allo
w that 
Citta
 to come right 
within the centre of this breath happening now.  If
 the 
Citta
" is not strong, you can "
only just see it with the breath around it – the co
ol fresh water in the centre with the 
"warmer water of breath on the outside, like a ring."
  You are still aware of the beautiful 
breath but with the 
Citta
 in the middle.  This is what happens if the 
nimmitta
 is 
strong enough:  there is a flow of cool beautiful w
"ater, powerful enough to push the "
"breath right off the edges of the mind, and all you"
’ll have left is the 
Citta
.  If the 
Citta
 is not strong it will sink back again and just the
 warm waters of the beautiful 
breath will remain.  You’re not ready yet.  Whateve
"r happens, it’s a natural process "
and all you do is watch.  The Buddha said it’s a na
tural process; you do not need to 
"make any resolutions, it happens all by itself.  In"
 fact it’s best if you step out of the 
way as soon as possible.  That’s why we call them ‘
stages of letting go’.  So allow 
"each stage to come up within the next, to come from"
 within the stage you are in now.  
It’s 
like 
a 
lotus 
opening 
up. 
The 
inner 
petals 
of 
the 
lotus 
are 
within 
the 
ones 
appearing to you now. 
"'
"
" is just opening up the stages of meditation, openi"
"ng up the beautiful breath, not "
"abandoning it, not trying to get rid of it but open"
"ing it up.  You open it up, you "
"abandon what’s caging it, what’s keeping it from go"
ing further – open it up and you 
find the 
Citta
 starts to be very brilliant.  What you do next is 
the same thing again.  
From that 
Citta
", from the very centre of the "
Citta
", flows the cool beautiful "
water of 
jhana
.  You don’t need to move towards the 
Citta
 or do anything.  Just 
allow the 
nimmitta
 to be there at the very centre of the experience. 
 In the same way 
that the breath is pushed to the edges of your mind
 by the beautiful cool waters of the 
Citta
", so, using the same simile, the "
jhanas
 just push the 
Citta
 to the edges of 
the mind.  The 
nimmitta
 is gone and you’re left with the 
jhanas
. 
The Ending of Everything 
If we want to go to the second 
jhana
 it comes from the very centre of the first 
jhana
", "
pushing out the first 
jhana
" like the cooler, purer water coming from the sprin"
g pushing 
the old pure water to the edges of the spring and t
hen out from your perception – 
that’s 
how 
samadhi
happens. 
You 
find 
that 
this 
only 
happens 
when 
you
take 
relinquishment as the central theme (

) of your meditation.  In the 
/
96
"
"
 there is something that impressed me as a young mo
nk.  It must have been 
twenty 
three 
years 
"ago, "
when 
I 
saw 
this. 
It 
says 
t
hat 
the 
mind 
which 
has 
the 

", "
the 
"mood, "
the 
"inclination, "
of 
&&
", "
easily

samadhi
", "
easily 
attains 
#&&
citta
", it reaches one peak.  "
+&&
 and 
	&&
 are pretty much 
"the same words, "
&&
" means abandoning, giving up and opening, freeing, "
doing 
nothing.  All of these 
Pali
 words are part of the meaning of the third noble t
ruth. 
"If that is the inclination of the mind, if that is "
"what you are holding in the mind, if it’s "
"the theme of the mind, if that’s what the mind is t"
"ending towards, then you are tending "
"towards the third noble truth, and the mind opens u"
p and the 
jhanas
 come all by 
themselves.  Never think ‘I can do 
jhanas
’ or ‘I can’t do 
jhanas
’ because both are 
stupid statements.  That’s why I get a bit peeved s
ometimes when people say they 
can’t do 
jhanas
", because if they only knew it, what they are sayin"
g is really technically 
true.  Get the ‘
I
’ out of the way and 
jhanas
 just happen.  It’s not ‘I can do 
jhanas
’:  
jhanas
" just happen when you get out of the way, when you "
let go and you follow the 
third noble truth. 
For one who experiences 
samadhi
" there is no need to make resolutions, to choose, o"
r 
"decide, ‘Oh, may I see things as they truly are’ ("

"!""*"
):  it’s a 
natural 
"process, "
it 
happens 
as 
an 
automatic 
consequ
"ence, "
for 
one 
who 
achieves 
samadhi
.  You are seeing truly all the insights that come 
up from the process of 
meditation which produces 
jhana
.  It is blocked by the second noble truth but what
produces it is the third noble truth.  You are actu
ally experiencing those two noble 
truths for yourself; you’re seeing the heart of the
"m, the meaning of them.  You’re "
seeing what the Buddha was pointing to when he talk
ed about those truths:  not just 
ideas but actually seeing what craving is.  You’re 
not just having ideas about letting 
"go of craving, not just ideas about what "
&
	&&
"
"
 
"means, but "
you’ve actually done it.  You have 
&
-ed
", you’ve "
	&&
-ed
", you’ve "
"
"
-ed
", "
you’ve 
 
-ed
", to anglicise those "
Pali
 words.  You’ve done it and that’s the result.  
You’ve let go and this is the bliss of letting go. 
 This is the reward.  You are seeing 
things as they truly are.  That’s the reason I get 
a bit disappointed sometimes when 
"people say, “Oh, Ajahn Brahm just teaches "
jhana
", just teaches "
samatha
", he doesn’t "
teach insight practice.”  That’s a ridiculous state
ment.  Anyone who teaches 
jhana
97
teaches insight and anyone who teaches insight teac
hes 
jhana
.  The two go together.  
"You’re seeing through experience, not just through "
thinking or theorising. 
"Experience is worth so much more than any thoughts,"
" ideas, books, or words.  The "
theory and the words are only pointing to the exper
ience that I’m talking about now.  
You experience these states of deep meditation and 
then you know what the absence 
"of craving is, because you’ve seen craving disappea"
r.  In the worn old simile of the 
"tadpole in the lake, only when the tadpole grows in"
to a frog and leaves the lake does it 
know what water is.  Only when you’ve left craving 
behind do you know what 
craving 
is. 
These 
are 
states 
clearly 
said 
by 
the 
B
uddha 
to 
be 
beyond 
"craving, "
blindfolding 
'
", where "
'
 cannot go.  The Buddha said these 
jhana
 states are 
pregnant with wisdom; wisdom follows naturally.  Th
at is why the Buddha said that 
from 
samadhi
 you do not need to make resolutions.  It happens n
aturally.  That’s why 
after you’ve emerged from a 
jhana
" you don’t need to say, ‘What shall I do next?’  "
Shut up!  Just allow the process to happen.  Have f
aith and confidence in what the 
Buddha taught.  You just go along for the ride and 
see what happens next. 
"If it’s real insight,"
"""!""*"
", seeing things as they truly are, as "
"opposed to seeing things as they seem to be, it onl"
y happens when the five hindrances 
"are abandoned, usually after a "
jhana
".  When this happens, real insight gives rise to "
!!

 the rejection of the world.  Seeing things as they
 truly are one gets 
!!

"distaste for the five senses, negativity towards th"

don’t 
need 
to 
make 
a 
"resolution, "
‘May 
I 
fade 
away? 
May 
I 
cease? 
May 
consciousness cease?’  You can’t make that determin
"ation, ‘May I cease?’  If you did, "
that’s called 
!
tanha
".  That’s the annihilationist craving, the craving "
for non-
existence; you can’t do it that way.  Trying to kil
"l oneself, that is annihilate oneself, is "
"impossible, it takes a ‘"
me
’ to kill me.  It’s like trying to eat your head; y
ou can’t eat 
"your own head, it’s impossible.  This is why intere"
st fades away and leads to 

.  
This cessation is the ending of everything. 
"Sometimes people get afraid.  It is bleak, thinking"
 of 
!!
" as cessation, ending!  "
"Whether we like it or not, that’s just what happens"
.  We don’t have any say in it.  So 
"there are no preferences, bleak or not bleak; it’s "
"just a word to describe these things, "
this is just nature.  In fact it is only when peopl
e have a sense of ‘self’ that they think 
it’s bleak.  You know that beautiful saying in the 
"suttas"
", ‘the "
Ariyas
", who have seen "
"this, say it is "
"
"
", say it is beautiful and happy, but the "
"

"
", the ones who "
"haven’t see this, say it is "
"dukkha"
", suffering’.  What the "
Ariyas
" say is ultimate bliss, the "
"

"
 say is bleak.  That’s the difference between an 

 and a 
"

"
.

 leads to 
!!
", cessation, the ending of everything, and it’s a n"
atural 
process.  So this whole path of Buddhism is all abo
ut non-self.  The more you can let 
go 
and 
allow 
the 
process 
to 
happen 
and 
the 
less 
you
rely 
upon 
‘self’ 
– 
that 
stubbornness of conceit and ego – the more peaceful
", happy, and beautiful this path "
"becomes, and the faster you go to liberation.  The "
Buddha said there are four types of 
"practice, the ‘fast and the happy’, and the ‘fast a"
nd the difficult’ full of suffering; the 
99
"‘slow and the happy’, and the ‘slow and the difficu"
lt’ full of suffering.  Whether it’s 
fast or slow depends on the power of one’s 
Indriyas
.  If you’ve got lots of faith and 
"confidence, which is "

", you will have lots of energy and you will have lo"
ts of 
mindfulness; 
samadhi
 will come and wisdom will come.  If you’ve got lot
s of 

"it’s a very fast path but if your cravings, your de"
"filements, especially your illusions of "
"a self, are very strong there will be a lot of suff"
ering.  The stronger your perception of 
self and ego – the ‘
me
’ – the harder this path becomes and the more pain 
it engenders.  
So be selfless and let go of this sense of me and m
ine.  Find out that it is only a 
"bubble, it’s an illusion that we’ve allowed to grow"
 in our consciousness.  Nothing is 
stable there!  You don’t exist – face up to it!  It
’s a great relief; so you’ve nothing to 
worry about then.  In this way the path becomes hap
py and fast.  Fast into 
jhanas
", fast "
"into insight, fast into Enlightenment!  It gives yo"
u a lot of happiness and bliss to 
"follow that path, but it also gives you all the ins"
ights that you read about in the 
suttas
.  
You are following in the footsteps of the Buddha.  
The 
jhanas
 are the footsteps of the 
Buddha
. 
All these things are to be experienced for yourself
.  If you get released you find that 
"Enlightenment is possible even in these days, as lo"
ng as you follow the example of the 
Buddha.  It’s in monasteries like this that the Bud
dha lived; it is practices like this that 
the Buddha practised.  You can check in the 
"suttas"
", and you will find that this is the "
"way.  So don’t mess around, and don’t waste time. "
May you all achieve Enlightenment tonight!

7  DHAMMA PRACTICE 
10
th
 May 2000 
I’ve been a monk for long time now and the whole pu
rpose of my monastic life is not 
to build monasteries or to go out and teach.  It is
 to practise 
Dhamma
. 
Dhamma
 is something that we all need to have a feeling fo
r.  At the start we think we 
know what 
Dhamma
" is and then with more faith and practice, we devel"
op more 
wisdom and understanding until finally full penetra
tion of the 
Dhamma
 is achieved.  
Dhamma
 is 
#
", it beckons us to ‘come and see’, and then it keep"
s leading 
inwards.  It keeps drawing us in.  It’s one of the 
amazing qualities of the Dhamma that 
"the more you listen to it the more it draws you in,"
 the more it takes hold of you as the 
"most important thing in life, the most important th"
ing in many lives.  You can’t resist 
"its invitation to come in, investigate, and get dee"
per into the 
Dhamma
.  That’s why 
it’s also called 

", it keeps leading us onwards. "
The Goal of 
Dhamma
Dhamma
Dhamma
Dhamma
The more we practise the more we find out about the
 beauty of the 
Dhamma
", and the "
release that is in the 
Dhamma
.  I call it release because that’s how it feels at
 every step 
of this path; with every progress that we make in t
his practice of Buddhism we feel 
more release from difficulties and burdens.  As far
 as the mind is concerned it gets 
better and better.  With our bodies it gets worse a
"nd worse, but we can’t do much "
about 
that! 
But 
at 
"least, "
if 
the 
mind 
is 
getting 
b
etter 
and 
"better, "
that 
gives 
us 
something to look forward to in our practice.  It’s
 an 

 practice.  It’s leading 
onwards. 
Where 
does it 
lead? 
It 
leads 
onwards 
int
o 
that 
"beautiful peace, that "
"beautiful happiness, the freedom of the mind.  It’s"
 very important to know that the 
goal of the 
Dhamma
 is freedom. 
"Often when people get upset and distressed, they co"
me and talk to the monks about 
their problems and difficulties in life.  But with 
"some people, you can see that it’s not "
"going to get any better, because they are not pract"
ising.  They are not following a path 
that leads to the freedom of the mind.  In fact man
y people are walking a path that is 
"full of entanglements, a path that is going to lead"
 to more problems and difficulties.  
101
You know it is going to happen that way because the
y are making more complications 
and more attachments in the world.  That’s the path
 that leads to suffering.  When 
people come to see the monks and they are suffering
" because their husband has died, "
"or their child has died, or they are very upset abo"
"ut something, it makes you question "
why they have those attachments in the first place.
  You already have them in this 
"lifetime, but don’t do it again.  You may want to g"
"et married or have relationships, but "
isn’t it enough to look after this body and mind ra
ther than trying to find fulfilment in 
those things when there is always going to be separ
ation at some stage? 
When we understand the 
Dhamma
 we understand the 
practice of letting 
"go, the "
practice of renunciation.  The practice of freeing 
the body and the mind from the 
entanglements of the world is a path that is going 
"to lead to more and more happiness, "
"more and more peace, more and more feeling of ease,"
 and to more and more wisdom.  
That is one of the other aspects of this 
Dhamma
:  it is to be seen by every wise person 
for him or herself.  That’s

#!!
**
. 
I sit up here and teach this 
Dhamma
" which you can agree with or not,  You can accept "
"it or reject it, because either way it doesn’t real"
ly matter.  The only thing a teacher can 
ever do is show the way.  Whether people want to li
sten to it or not that’s really up to 
them.  I can’t apply force.  The point is that ever
yone has to find out for him or 
herself.  So my job is to point it out and encourag
e you to try it.  I have to use as good 
a sales pitch on 
jhana
", insight, and Enlightenment as I possibly can, bec"
ause these 
things 
are
 possible for human beings.  I have to try and enco
urage everyone that it is 
"possible, that each one of you can achieve this.  O"
"nce I convince people of that, then "
people put forth the effort – that’s the ‘going onw
ards’.  

nd it 
does
 create these 
beautiful states of mind and feelings of freedom.  
It also creates wisdom.  The more 
one practises the more one understands this mind an
d this personality with all its 
"hang-ups:  all it’s seeking for happiness, all its "
problems of ill will towards itself and 
towards others.  You see all of that as pure crazin
ess.  If you have a moment of ill will 
"towards anyone, towards yourself, or towards living"
", you are crazy.  You are insane "
because you are just hurting yourself; and you are 
creating misery for your own ‘self’. 
Opening the Mind to Truth 
102
Adult people look after their own 
kamma
".  If we get angry at the weather, it’s not the "
weather’s fault.  If we get angry at the nail becau
se it bends when we try to hammer it 
"into a piece of wood, it’s not the nails fault.  Th"
at is life!  Welcome to life.  People 
who argue with life are in denial – denial that thi
"ngs go wrong, denial that they are not "
in control.  People usually say that they are in co
ntrol.  They say life goes the way 
"they want it to go, but that’s not the truth of lif"
"e.  By that I mean the world outside, the "
"of weather, trees, nails, and books.  That sort of "
world is completely beyond our 
power and our control.  Even though we have a littl
"e ability to manipulate the world, "
don’t get sucked in and think that you are in contr
ol.  If you do that it’s called 
attachment. 
Attachment is what we think we control.  When we re
"alise we don’t control anything, "
then 
we 
are 
free 
from attachments. 
We 
can 
just 
flo
at 
and flow 
rather 
than 
be 
burdened by all these things; this is the wisdom th
at comes when we meditate.  The 
more we practise the 
Dhamma
", the more we understand.  There is a sense of the "
opening up of the mind to truth.  But with that ope
"ning of the mind to truth, we have "
to be very careful because 
everyone thinks they are wise
.  So many people in this 
world go around thinking that they are very knowled
geable and smart.  Hardly anyone 
admits that they are foolish. 
That’s really strange isn’t it?  Many people who co
me to the Buddhist Society in town 
think that they are experts on Buddhism.  That’s wh
y they come and argue with us 
sometimes.  Maybe they’ve read a book and then they
" come and argue with a monk, "
who has been living the life for thirty years.  The
y really think that they can outwit a 
"monk!  So this is it, everyone thinks that they are"
 experts.  Why?  Because of illusion 
or delusion.  It is something that a person just ca
nnot see; they think they’re wise.  
That’s the reason this whole thing about wisdom – w
hat it is and what it isn’t – is so 
difficult to get a handle on. 
I’ve always kept one of the beautiful sayings of th
e Buddha in mind.  The Buddha 
said to Venerable 
0 
", and his foster mother "
'
p

a

12
 “Whatever 
Dhamma
 you know lead to 
!!
...”  This beautiful word 
!!
 means revulsion 
"from the world, pushing us away from the things of "
the five senses.  It leads to 
&
; 
103
"dispassion or fading away, which leads to "

","
" cessation, the ending of things, "
which leads to 
"
"
– this is perhaps the most beautiful term in the li
st – the peace 
and tranquillity.  This in turn leads to 
!**
", a really deep and profound knowledge, "
which leads to 

!
", enlightenment knowledge, which leads to "
!!
.  “If it 
"leads to those seven things;” the Buddha said, “"
0 
", "
'
p

a

1
", you can "
"know for certain, and be absolutely sure that that "
is the 
Dhamma
.” 
That’s the teaching of the Buddha; that’s wisdom.  
I always check myself to see that 
"whether what I teach, what wisdom I think I have, p"
roduces the goods.  Does it lead to 
&
", "
the 
fading 
"away, "
to 
"cessation, "
to 
deep 
"peace, "
to 
profound 
"knowledge, "
"Enlightenment, "
!!
?  If it leads to those things it’s called wisdom. 
 If it doesn’t 
"turn you away from the world, if it just creates mo"
re entanglements with the world 
"and you think that the world is a wonderful thing, "
then it’s not 
!!
.  If you think 
"you can get rid of your attachments and cravings, a"
nd then live in this world and have 
"a jolly good time, that’s not "
!!
.  
!!
 is what sees the problem. 
It’s not that life out there is suffering; it’s ‘me
’ experiencing life as suffering.  There is 
"also this dualism of subject and object, and it all"
 comes together as 
"dukkha"
", suffering, "
the first noble truth.  That’s how the Buddha becam
"e the Buddha, by seeing that truth, "
seeing that there is no little corner of 

 where he could hang out and have a 
good time.  
It’s rotten to the core
.  That is what the first noble truth means.  That 
truth 
leads us to 
!!
.  It leads to a complete turning away from the wor
ld.  It does not 
lead to turning away from part of the world and the
n cherishing another part but to 
turning away from the 
whole
 world – turning away from the world outside and al
so 
turning away from the world inside. 
"Once that happens, "
!!
 automatically leads us to 
&
", the dispassion towards "
the things of the world:  you don’t care what peopl
e say about you; you don’t care so 
"much about your body, its health or vigour, about t"
"he things that you eat, or whether "
the coffee runs out.  What’s the big deal?  There i
"s always some tea, there is always "
"some water, there is always something to drink.  Se"
eing this one understands 
&
. 
"Wisdom leads to dispassion, it leads to the ending,"
 the cessation of things.  There are 
104
many people in the world who write big books about 
Buddhism and many write silly 
books about Buddhism.  There are also people who wr
ite the forewords to those books 
and say what wonderful books they are.  It’s just s
illy people supporting each other.  
None of it seems to lead to 
&
 and 

", to that peacefulness of mind, the "
"
"
.  Achieving those peaceful states of mind is a sur
e sign of wisdom. 
Real Peace 
"If wisdom arises, its whole purpose, its whole job,"
" its whole function, is to alleviate "
suffering.  It’s just like taking a pill.  If it is
" the right pill, you take it and the ailment "
goes or the pain lessens; that’s how you know if th
e pill is suitable for the ailment or 
not.  If it is wisdom and you can spout it around t
"he coffee table, talk to your friends "
"about it, write books about it, but if it doesn’t m"
"ake you peaceful, if it doesn’t liberate "
"you from suffering, what’s the point of it?  In fac"
t it’s not really wisdom at all.  It’s 
what we call 
*
", proliferation.  It’s just conceit.  This is why t"
he wisdom that 
liberates one is the only wisdom that is worthwhile
.  This is what the 
Dhamma
 does to 
you once you really become wise.  It leads to peace
 and tranquillity; it takes you to 
jhanas
", to real peace. "
People sometimes just don’t know what peace is.  Th
ey think peace is when they can 
get their own way and do whatever they want in this
 world.  ‘Leave me in peace!’  
What do they mean by ‘leave me in peace’?  Is it so
 that they can watch their 
"television, so they can have relationships, and mak"
e a lot of money?  That’s not peace 
in the world.  Real peace is not the peace outside 
but the peace inside the mind.  It is 
"the mind that can be tranquil, that can be silent. "
 It is the beautiful peace in the mind.  
"Sometimes we can hear that peace outside, especiall"
"y in a quiet monastery like this, "
"on an evening when there is no wind, no rain, when "
words seem to echo in the silence.  
That’s the beautiful peace that 
Dhamma
 leads towards.  It’s wonderful to be able to 
"turn to the peace of nature, to the quietness of a "
monastery such as this. 
I often turn to the memory of the quietness I exper
ienced in some of the deep caves in 
"which I have meditated, because they really meant s"
omething to me in my life as a 
monk.  I have been fortunate to go to places in Tha
iland where there are forest 
monasteries up in the hills that have deep caves.  
I was able to spend hours in those 
105
"caves, so dark, so silent, just having wonderful me"
ditations there.  That external 
silence seems to remind me of what I’m supposed to 
be doing.  It seems to be pointing 
in the direction of the inner silence.  That’s the 
reason I taught at the weekend that one 
"of the ways to help one’s meditation is to recall, "
at the very beginning of each 
"meditation, the places or times when one was very q"
uiet.  Bring those places and 
times of tranquillity into the minds eye by using t
he function of memory.  Dwell upon 
"that time when you were tranquil, when the outside "
world was very still and peaceful.  
If you can dwell on such a memory you will find tha
t your inner mind will also 
become tranquil.  It’s a way of reminding yourself 
what the goal of all this is.  It’s 
"about wise peace, the freedom of the mind from all "
"this noise, all this doing, grasping "
and craving.  Once you can bring that into your min
ds eye at the very beginning of the 
"meditation, it sets the tone and it becomes much ea"
sier for you to find your way 
through the meditation.  It makes it easier to find
 a way through the hindrances and 
"achieve the goal:  the great peaceful, blissful sta"
tes of meditation. 
Whenever you get stuck or lose your way in your med
itation just remind yourself to 
bring 
into 
the 
mind 
the 
times 
when 
you 
were 
peacefu
"l, "
and 
that 
will 
stop 
the 
restlessness of the mind.  It will stop the doubt; 
it will stop the wandering mind.  As 
"you recall the goal, you remember that the whole pu"
"rpose of this monastic life, the "
"whole reason behind it, is to see that "
Dhamma
 which releases you.  This brings that 
"tranquillity, that freedom, which brings peace. "
"Even though a person may not be Enlightened, or eve"
"n a Stream Winner yet, there is "
still 
something 
about 
"Enlightenment, "
the 
peace 
of 
E
"nlightenment, "
that 
they 
can 
understand and that gives the whole path a directio
n.  I always remember what this 
path is all about.  What are we here for?  We are n
ot here to build the best monastery 
in the world.  We are not here to make beautiful hu
ts.  We are not here to have good 
friends.  We are not here to write books.  We are n
ot here to become famous as the 
best Buddhist teacher in Serpentine.  We are not he
re just to make good 
kamma
.  
We 
"are here to become liberated, to be free from "

", to find what the Buddha found"
.  
"There is a thing called wisdom, there is a thing ca"
"lled truth, there is a thing called "
"Enlightenment, and that’s on offer in this monaster"
y for whoever has the courage to 
take it up. 
106
"What if you make that your goal, and keep it in min"
d?  You know that the goal 
"embraces peace, silence, tranquillity, and freedom."
  These are all descriptions of 
!!
.  You may not be able to describe 
!!
 in words but you can feel some of 
its qualities intuitively.  Sometimes you just need
 to rely upon that.  It’s something 
inside you that knows what Enlightenment is all abo
ut.  There is something inside you 
that even knows what 
jhanas
" are all about, because most of you have been monks"
 and 
"nuns many times before.  It is reminding you and, o"
nce you can bring that goal to 
"mind, it shows you what the "
Dhamma
 truly is.  It is something that the Buddha said 
was 
		
", that which can be experienced in this very life. "
 Not to rely on a 
belief of what’s going to happen in our next life b
ut to experience it now.  It’s 
 
", "
"or timeless, that’s why we don’t need to change the"
 teachings to fit into modern 
"Western culture, whatever that is.  The "
Dhamma
" of the Buddha, the heart of it all, is "
"literally timeless.  It is eternal and for anybody,"
" in any age, in any era, presented "
clearly and accurately.  It will always resonate wi
th people because it’s talking about 
the mind and the body.  They might change depending
" on their genes, the culture "
"might change, but the mind, the heart, doesn’t chan"
"ge that much, it’s basically the "
same. 
Essentially it’s the problem of the ‘doer’ and the 
‘knower’.  Once one sees this and 
"understands, "
one 
understands 
why 
the 
Buddha’s 
teach
ing 
is 
so 
timeless. 
One 
understands 
how the 
Dhamma reaches across twenty-fi
"ve centuries, from ancient "
"India – that strange culture, so different from our"
s – to our modern society.  There is 
"some commonality, something which strikes us, reson"
"ates with us as being important, "
and 
that’s 
this 
Dhamma 
quality. 
The 
meaning 
of 
the
word 
Dhamma 
– 
as 
the 
Venerable 
Bhikkhu 
Bodhi 
so 
beautifully 
put 
it 
in 
on
e 
of 
his 
books 
(
The 
Great 
Discourse on Causation
 published by the Buddhist Publication Society) – i
s looking 
to the heart of the matter where everything comes f
"rom, the source, the essence, the "
"ultimate, the law, the rule behind everything.  The"

", the meaning, on the other "
"hand is the consequences of that Dhamma, how that "
Dhamma
 works out in the world.  
But here we are looking at the 
Dhamma
", the heart, the source; this is what wisdom is "
"about.  It is about the core, finding that wisdom g"
iven by the Buddha.  The Buddha 
"gave us a practical path to find this out, he gave "
"instructions, and it’s always the case "
107
"that if you follow those instructions, they’re goin"
g to lead to the goal. 
Less Choice – More Freedom 
The 
Sati		
"Sutta"
 says this path leads in one direction only; if we 
continue 
walking this path we will have to arrive at the goa
l.  It’s just a matter of time!  That’s 
"a powerful saying, a wonderful teaching.  The troub"
"le is though, we sometimes get off "
the path.  We don’t keep going because we haven’t g
"ot enough faith, we haven’t got "
"enough confidence.  However, we should remember tha"
t if we keep walking just a 
little bit further then we find a little bit more h
appiness.  That’s the beauty of the path:  
it’s a happy path.  At every stage of the path we g
"et a prize, we get more happiness, "
"more peace, and more understanding.  That’s what ma"
kes it a gradual path that leads 
us 
on 
and 
on 
and 
"on, "

.
It 
doesn’t 
lead 
us 
on 
because 
we 
think 
we 
understand more; it leads us on because we get more
" happiness, more peace, more "
"freedom, more joy, and more bliss.  This is the gre"
at thing about the 
Dhamma
:  you 
don’t need to look so far into the distance to gain
 some benefit or to get a taste of 
!!
. 
How can I make myself more peaceful and happy today
?  How can I let go of more 
and keep my virtuous conduct pure?  Don’t break any
" of the rules or precepts, be "
more 
"restrained, "
keep 
the 
monastic 
rules 
of 
getting
up 
early 
in 
the 
morning 
to 
meditate.  Even if you are tired just meditate; it’
s better than falling asleep.  At least 
"by getting up you are doing something, you are crea"
ting energy.  If you are going to 
"get up, you might as well do it properly by meditat"
"ing.  In the beginning, keeping the "
monastic rules means giving up so much of what we w
ant to do. 
"People sometimes ask me, “Why are these rules the w"
ay they are?”  The purpose of 
the rules is to stop you having to think.  If you h
ad to make up the rules for yourself 
"then there would be more thinking, thinking, thinki"
ng.  ‘We should do this’ or ‘We 
"shouldn’t do that’.  The more rules there are, the "
less choice there is for us.  The less 
"choice there is for us, the more freedom we have.  "
"The more freedom we have, the "
more peace we have.  Those of you who have to go to
 the hardware stores now and 
again to get things for the monastery know what it’
s like if you have to get different 
types of nails or different types of screws.  When 
there is too much choice it makes 
108
things really complicated.  It’s so easy when there
 is only one thing you have to get. 
I really feel for people who live in the world.  If
 they want to get a toothbrush there 
are a hundred different types to choose from:  diff
erent styles and different types of 
bristle or handles.  Goodness knows how difficult i
t is to make choices in this world 
"now, and because there are so many choices, there’s"
 less freedom.  So it’s wonderful 
when there’s not much choice.  You know you just ha
ve to get up in the morning and 
that’s it.  You don’t have to think about it.  You 
know you only have to eat what’s 
there.  You choose from what’s there and that’s it.
"  If you had a menu, imagine what it "
would be like.  If instead of having 

 we had a supporter who owned a couple of 
restaurants and they sent the menu out every mornin
g so we could order up whatever 
we wanted – imagine if I gave you the menu every mo
rning and you had to choose 
what to eat.  It would be terrible having all those
 choices and decisions to make. 
It’s very wonderful not having to make decisions.  
It’s nice being on retreat:  you 
don’t even put the food into your own bowl; someone
 else does it for you.  I’ve 
noticed when I’ve been on retreat – especially duri
ng the rains retreat – how I actually 
enjoy my food much more because someone else has pu
t it into the bowl for me.  I 
think it is because I don’t have to go through all 
the hassle of choosing.  Someone 
brings the bowl up and I just eat what’s there.  Th
at’s choicelessness.  It means more 
"freedom, more happiness, and more peace. "
One of the reasons we have all these rules is to gi
ve us freedom from having to make 
decisions and to avoid arguing about what we should
 do.  It’s already been arranged 
"and decided, and that makes life so much easier, so"
 much freer.  We can use our mind 
for more important things than deciding what to eat
 or deciding how to do things.  
That’s also the happiness of hierarchy.  When someo
ne else tells you what to do it 
"makes it easier; you don’t have to think about it, "
you just do it.  You know what it’s 
"like when you get into that complaining mind, ‘I do"
n’t want to do this.  Why does 
Ajahn Brahm always ask me to clean the toilets?  Wh
y can’t I do something else?’  
‘Doesn’t he think I can hammer a nail into a piece 
of wood like anyone else?’  ‘I only 
want the really nice jobs.’ 
"It’s really strange, but one of the jobs that I rea"
lly wanted to do once I became a monk 
109
"was to dig the earth, to get a spade and just dig i"
nto the earth.  As soon as I became a 
novice I couldn’t wait to become a monk so that I c
ould stop digging and doing all 
"that sort of stuff!  It’s was very strange, but I r"
ealised that it was because I couldn’t do 
"it that I wanted to do it, it was just the perversi"
ty of desire.  As a monk you don’t have 
"to do those things, because it’s already decided wh"
"at you can and can’t do, and that’s "
"it.  That gives a certain sense of peace, a certain"
" sense of happiness, the happiness of "
the purity of one’s precepts.  One is letting go of
" the ‘doer’, this person who always "
"wants to control and manipulate, who wants to decid"
"e what’s right and what’s wrong, "
"what should be done and what shouldn’t be done, bla"
"h, blah, blah. "
An End to Coming and Going 
That 
‘doer’ 
inside 
of 
us 
creates 
this 
critical 
mind
– 
the 
judgemental 
"mind, "
the 
faultfinding mind – it creates so many problems and
 difficulties for us.  Because of 
this ‘doer’ we even judge beautiful people and crea
te enemies out of them.  Even the 
great 
Ariyas
", we can hate them and have ill will towards them, "
criticise them and put 
them down.  It’s bad 
kamma
 to criticise 
Ariyas
".  Nevertheless because of stupidity, or "
"rather because of the judgemental mind, the mind th"
at is always under the control of 
"this ‘doer’, we can even criticise the Buddha, even"
 curse the Buddha.  That’s because 
this doing mind hasn’t really been seen for what it
 is.  It is just a tyrant and a stupid 
tyrant at that. 
The more one meditates and practises restraint thro
"ugh the precepts, restraint of the "
"senses, restraint of the inner commentary, the more"
 one gets into the peaceful states of 
mind.  Then one can see what this thinking mind is 
all about.  After a while you just 
don’t believe it any more.  This is the way it goes
":  it can criticise your best friends, it "
"can love people who are fools, it can praise idiots"
 and find fault with the wise; that is 
the perversity of the thinking mind.  That’s why I 
don’t trust it any more.  Once you 
see it for what it is you realise how much trouble 
it has caused you.  So just shut up 
and be quiet! 
"In this monastery, people often think that they wan"
"t to go here or go there, but "
wherever you go you take ‘you’ with you.  You’ll go
 from one place to another but 
you will find out that whatever habits and characte
"r traits you have here, you’ll still "
have them somewhere else.  Whatever obstacles you f
ind here you’ll find elsewhere.  
110
"‘The monks here, or the teacher, are stupid, and yo"
u know they are not really up to 
scratch’.  You’ll go somewhere else and they’ll be 
the same.  That’s because you have 
the same defilements.  It’s not because of the teac
"her, it’s because of the way you see "
the teacher.  It’s not the other monks but the way 
you see the other monks.  It’s not the 
"place, it’s the way you see that place.  You will t"
ake this wherever you go until you 
can be free from all of that. 
"When I was the second monk in Thailand, many years "
"ago, if people came to me and "
"said they wanted to leave, I would say, “Well if yo"
"u really want to go, now is not the "
best time.  Because if you really want to leave and
" you are just following craving, that "
"desire, and those attachments, what you should real"
ly do is stay.  This is a really great 
time 
for 
gaining 
wisdom; 
you 
can 
really 
make 
a 
lot 
of 
progress 
towards 
Enlightenment”.  When you really want to go that’s 
"the time to stay, because when "
you stay you are going against the stream of the mi
nd – you really want to go but 
instead you stay and call the mind’s bluff.  Then y
ou actually win; you have a great 
victory.  It’s only a matter of days or weeks or mo
"nths, it doesn’t take that long, and "
then the desire to go has completely disappeared.  
"You don’t want to go any more, "
and if you don’t want to go there’s not much point 
in going.  That’s the way I tried to 
keep people in the monastery for long periods of ti
"me.  It’s not a joke, because there is "
a lot of truth in it.  The only time you should go 
is if you don’t really care if you go or 
not.  That’s the right time to go because then you 
"are not following your critical, "
thinking mind.  That’s 
Metta
", that’s self, that’s ego.  If you believe in that,"
 that’s 
attachment to all those ideas. 
"There is a great sense of peace when you surrender,"
" give up, let go, and renounce.  "
"Just go according to the Eightfold Path, the path t"
"hat leads one in the right direction, "
to 
!!
".  Just surrender, give up to it, and patiently wai"
t.  If you do that you’ll find 
out it’s the right path.  You don’t have to believe
 because the more you surrender the 
more freedom you feel and the more peaceful you fee
l inside. 
Sometimes it feels as if there is a raging tyrant i
"nside, pushing you from pillar to post.  "
How many times have you run away?  How many times h
ave you followed that stupid 
thinking mind?  How many times has it led you by th
"e nose, as if you were a stupid "
"cow?  Many, many times!  And then sometimes you jus"
"t say, “That’s enough, I’m not "
111
"going to be led by you, I’ll be led by the "
Dhamma
" instead, led by the Eightfold path.  "
That is what I’m going to do.  That’s it!” 
I made a determination when I was a young monk that
 I would never leave any 
monastery unless I was asked to go somewhere else o
"r because of my conduct, I was "
asked to get out.  I have never asked to leave 
or g
o anywhere.  I’ve kept that 
"resolution for all these years, and I’ve been a mon"
k now for over twenty-five years.  I 
only came to Australia because I was sent over here
 by my teacher and I only ever go 
anywhere because I am asked to go.  I recommend tha
t practise to any of you who 
have got the courage to keep it.  It’s a hard pract
"ice; it takes a lot of trust, a lot of "
"confidence, a lot of courage. "
But it’s a beautiful practise to do.  What it means
 is that instead of following your 
"own mind you’re surrendering, renouncing, giving up"
", letting go.  You will find "
meditation becomes easy because that’s the very thi
ng that creates meditation:  the 
"letting go of the thinking mind, the letting go of "
"the controlling, and the letting go of "
the manipulating.  Isn’t that what happens in medit
ation?  You’re in one place and 
you want to go somewhere else.  You’re with the bre
ath and you want to get to a 
Citta
 or you’re with ‘present moment awareness’ and you 
want to get something 
"else.  There’s always that movement, that wanting s"
"omething else, that wanting to be "
somewhere else.  It’s the coming and going called r
estlessness. 
One of the stories that I remember from Zen Buddhis
"m was when Lin-Chi, the "
"founder of the Rinzai sect of Zen Buddhism, had jus"
t been to another monastery and 
returned to pay his respects to his teacher.  The t
eacher replied by punching him in the 
"stomach, so you are very lucky this is not a Zen mo"
nastery.  I remember the teacher 
"said to Lin-Chi, “When is there going to be an end "
to all this coming and going?”  If 
"you’ve just come back from another monastery, when "
is there going to be an end to all 
this coming and going?  What is coming and going?  
"Coming and going, going and "
coming – you should be fed up with it after a while
. 
"So, it’s nice to be able to make an end to all the "
coming and going in the mind – 
coming from this state of mind to another state of 
"mind.  Just shut up, give up, let go "
112
and surrender to the path.  Surrender to watching t
he breath; surrender to 
anapanasati
.  
"“Too hot, too cold!”  “Too early, too late!”  “I’ve"
" been working all day, I’m too "
tired!”  Shut up!  Just watch the breath.  I love d
oing that because I’ve got a rebellious 
nature inside me.  It must be from growing up in th
e sixties. 
It’s amazing what happens when you rebel against wh
"at should be happening, against "
"being too tired, too hot, too cold, or too sick.  Y"
ou’ll prove to yourself that you can do 
meditation whenever you want.  In the middle of the
 night when you wake up and 
"you’ve only had an hour’s sleep, you can get up and"
 meditate and get into a nice 
meditation even though you thought you wouldn’t be 
able to.  You’ve been working 
all day – sit down and get into a 
jhana
".  You’re really sick with a fever, even lying on "
your side – watch the breath and get into a 
jhana
.  You can do that.  When that 
happens it proves you cannot trust the seeking mind
" but that you can trust the Buddha, "
the 
Dhamma
", and the "

$&
.  This is what we mean by going for refuge to the 
Triple Gem.  It means we find that we can let go wh
enever we want.  That’s what 
"meditation is:  abandoning, letting go of the contr"
"oller, letting go of the doer, being "
"content, and allowing peacefulness to grow in the m"
ind. 
"We’ll never get peaceful by coming and going, we on"
ly get peaceful by staying still.  
"‘Staying still’, ‘not coming and going’, that’s a m"
etaphor for not doing so many 
"things.  Simplify your life, make it as simple as p"
"ossible, so that you don’t have much "
"to look after.  See if you can unburden the mind, s"
implify the mind so that you don’t 
have much to think about.  Just stay with the breat
h; make it your friend and just be 
with it until it becomes so peaceful and beautiful.
  When it’s peaceful and beautiful 
you know that is wisdom.  It’s wisdom that leads to
 things like 
"
"
","
calmness 
and
tranquillity.  The Buddha told Up

li and Mah

p

japat

 Gotam

", that if something "
leads to 
"
"
", then that is the "
Dhamma
. 
That’s the teaching of all the Buddha’s.  So if it 
leads to peace you know you are on 
"the right track.  If it leads to restlessness, if i"
"t leads to irritation, if it leads to ill will, or "
"to a fault finding mind, then you know you’re going"
 in the wrong direction.  Don’t 
follow that direction; it’s going to lead to more s
"uffering for you, stopping you from "
enjoying the fruits of the path.  So understand tha
t the 
Dhamma
 is that which leads to 
113
wisdom.  And you know it’s wisdom if it leads to pe
ace.  You know it’s peace 
"because it shuts up the doing, thinking mind, and t"
here is contentment.  That’s the 
reason this path leads to more and more contentment
".  If you follow the path, if you "
"follow virtue, it leads to contentment. "
Freedom 
"You are so content keeping eight precepts, and then"
 all the precepts of a novice or a 
"monk.  You’re so content having no money, not havin"
g to deal with that any more.  
"So content not having a wife, children, or parents."
"  So content just being alone, free "
from all those burdens.  So content just with the p
"recepts of a monk, content to be "
"free, because these beautiful rules free you from a"
ll of those entanglements.  Free 
because this mind has completely let go of this wor
"ld, with all its problems and "
difficulties.  Free because you can dwell in the pr
esent moment whenever you like.  
You can drop everything.  Free because you can drop
 the body and dwell in the 
jhanas
.
"  Free because you know that life, "

", "
is limited. 
These are the freedoms of the Buddha.  These are th
e freedoms available to each one 
"of you, the peace and the wisdom that gives you gre"
at joy and happiness.  That’s what 
"this monastic life is all about, that’s what Buddhi"
sm is all about.  So please remember 
"what the path is, what the goal is, and just check "
yourself to see if you’re following a 
"wrong path that is creating attachments, ill will, "
"irritation, and activity or whatever.  If "
"you know you are walking in the wrong direction, ch"
ange.  It’s really up to you.

8  HUMAN RIGHTS IN BUDDHISM 
Dhammaloka Buddhist Centre 
9
th
 June 2000 
I have just returned this afternoon from a three-we
ek trip to Malaysia and Singapore.  
It was an exhilarating and inspiring trip.  I gave 
many 
Dhamma
 teachings and also 
attended a Buddhist conference.  When I gave the ta
lk there were two ‘Black Marias’ 
full of riot police stationed outside the venue in 
the CBD in Singapore.  I gave the talk 
to a very large crowd of over a thousand people in 
one of the auditoriums.  So here in 
Dhammaloka I feel I’m with a nice cosy group of fri
ends.  I actually found out later 
on – and I was quite disappointed – that the riot p
olice weren’t there for my talk but 
for a ‘karaoke bar’ and night club next door.  It w
ould have been something if I could 
have put in my biography that so many people attend
ed one of my talks the authorities 
had to station riot police outside. 
It was wonderful to see so many people interested i
n learning about meditation and 
listening to the 
Dhamma
".  Actually, it shows that in those countries – Mal"
aysia has 
something like a twenty-six percent Buddhist popula
tion and Singapore around forty-
five percent – they are very short of good teachers
.  They need good teachers to teach 
Buddhism in a way that makes sense and is relevant 
to human life in a profound way.  
Not telling people what they already know but chall
"enging them to find a deeper, "
more 
accurate 
way 
of 
looking 
at 
life. 
And 
the 
Dhamma
must 
be 
"entertaining, "
especially in places like Malaysia and Singapore we
re the people are so stressed out.  
The last thing they want is a lecture.  They want a
" little fun now and again, with a "
little bit of 
Dhamma
 in between.  That’s my style. 
I also attended the ‘First Global Conference on Bud
dhism’ in order to see other ideas 
"in Buddhism, to widen my own perspective on the Bud"
dha’s teachings and also to 
participate and give some input on the West Austral
ian experience of Buddhism.  The 
tradition at this Buddhist Centre is Ajahn Chah’s f
orest tradition.  It’s a tradition that 
is extremely vibrant all over the world. 
115
I would like to talk this evening about a topic tha
t was presented at that conference by 
"one of the speakers, a professor in Buddhist studie"
"s from England, ‘"
The Relevance of 
Human Rights to Buddhism
’.  It was only a twenty-minute presentation but it
 struck a 
chord with me because about two years ago someone a
sked me if I could give a talk 
on that subject.  Because of one thing or another –
 I was going overseas or teaching a 
retreat or something – I never got around to it.  W
hat’s the relevance of human rights 
to Buddhism?  This is a very important subject.  It
 is something many people talk 
"about.  It gives them a direction, whether for good"
 or for bad.  So I thought this would 
"be a good opportunity, while it’s fresh in my mind,"
 to talk about Buddhism and 
human rights. 
Rights and Freedoms 
One of the things that really impressed me with the
 talk I heard at the conference was 
that the whole idea of human rights is a very Weste
rn idea.  It basically comes from 
"the Judaeo-Christian culture.  In many places, espe"
"cially in the East, people have a lot "
of trouble with human rights.  Not so much in its f
"airness and the role of justicel, but "
in what underpins it.  Where does it come from?  Wh
y human rights?  Without an 
understanding of the underlying theory behind human
" rights, it sometimes doesn’t "
"make much sense.  For example, when I reflect on th"
e principles and work out the 
"consequences, I am amused by the human right that ‘"
everyone is born equal’.  That 
might 
be 
so 
according 
to 
Christianity 
or 
Judaism 
bu
t 
it 
certainly 
isn’t 
correct 
according to Buddhism. 
"So far as Buddhists are concerned, we are not all b"
orn equal.  Some people are born 
"big, some people are born small.  Some people are b"
"orn intelligent, some people are "
born stupid.  The point is we come into this world 
with our 
kamma
 from past lives.  
"So, straight away – for a Buddhist – that principle"
 of equality at birth doesn’t make 
sense.  Even as a young man it never made sense to 
me.  I could see that when people 
were born they certainly were not equal.  This is j
ust an idea.  Even though it is a 
noble idea it isn’t true.  Throughout my life as a 
monk I’ve always preferred truth.  
What ‘actually is’ to what ‘I would like it to be’.
  Idealism has its place but surely it 
must be founded on truth and reality.  Otherwise we
 are just building a fantasy that 
116
doesn’t really have any meaning or any solid founda
tion in the reality of our lives.  
Isn’t it true that each one of you came into this w
orld with advantages over some 
people and disadvantaged compared to others?  It’s 
called the law of 
kamma
.
The other thing that doesn’t make sense in the West
ern idea of human rights is the 
whole idea of freedom.  So often our societies – es
pecially in the Western world – 
"celebrate this idea of freedom, and we think we liv"
e in the so-called free world.  
Governments and societies are trying to enshrine th
at idea of freedom into different 
societies but basically I don’t think they know wha
t the word means.  Because of that 
they get into so much trouble and difficulty and cr
eate a lot of mischief for society; 
just as we do in our own little societies and in th
e home.  We know what the rights 
"and freedoms in our society are, but what does that"
 freedom mean?  When you start to 
apply the law of 
kamma
 to this idea of human rights and freedoms there ar
e some 
things that don’t make sense. 
What I’ve seen in the world is that people want the
 freedom of desire.  They want to 
be free to express their desire. free to follow the
ir desires at whatever cost.  What 
"Buddhism wants, what Buddhism celebrates, is not th"
e freedom 
of
" desire, but freedom "
from
 desire.  That’s going in a completely different di
rection. 
One of the stories I told at the conference was the
 story of the ‘Wishing Game’.  Five 
children were playing this Wishing Game.  The first
" one was asked, “If you had a "
"wish what would you want” and the child said, “If I"
 had a wish I would want an ice 
cream.”  She liked ice cream.  The second child who
" was a little bit older said, “If I "
had a wish I’d wish for an ice cream factory.”  The
 first child thought that was really 
clever because if you had an ice cream factory you 
could get an ice cream whenever 
you wanted one.  Not just one ice cream but hundred
s of ice creams.  The third child 
"was asked, “What’s your wish” and he said, “I’d lik"
e a billion dollars.  Because with a 
"billion dollars I can buy an ice cream factory, a c"
"ake factory, a fish and chip shop or "
"whatever else I want, and I could do a lot more”.  "
"The first two kids thought, ‘wow!  "
Aren’t we stupid?  Why didn’t we have think of that
?’  They thought that this young 
fellow who wished for a billion dollars was a geniu
s.  But the next child when asked 
117
what he wished did even better than wanting a billi
"on dollars, he said, “I wish I had "
"three wishes, so that I could wish for an ice cream"
" factory with my first wish, a billion "
"dollars with my second wish, and with my third wish"
 I could wish for another three 
"wishes.”  They thought, ‘wow!  You can’t do better "
than that.’  Can you think of a 
wish that is even better than that – to have three 
wishes and the third wish is that you 
can wish for another three wishes?  But the last ch
"ild did surpass that, he was the "
"Buddha to be, and said, “I wish I had no wishes.” "
Isn’t that interesting?  Because when you have no m
ore wishes it means that you are 
completely content.  You’re free from all desires. 
 You’re free from all that wanting.  
You’re 
free 
from 
all 
feeling 
of 
"lack, "
the 
feeling 
t
hat 
somewhere 
in 
your 
"life, "
"somewhere in your body, somewhere in your mind, som"
ething is missing.  Imagine 
"what it would be like if you had no more wishes, co"
mpletely happy with whatever 
"comes along, completely happy with this present mom"
ent.  You don’t wish for it to be 
anything else.  You look at your husband and he’s a
bsolutely perfect.  You don’t wish 
him to change at all.  You look at your wife and sh
e’s so beautiful.  You don’t wish 
"her to be anything different, neither better nor wo"
rse.  No more wishing is going 
against the grain of modern society isn’t it?  We w
ant to have the freedom to have 
more wishes.  We want the freedom to have more choi
ces and more money to express 
our choices.  We want more freedom to express our i
ndividuality. 
Buddhism says the cleverest child is the child who 
"wishes for no more wishes.  So, "
the freedoms that people celebrate and enshrine in 
such documents as the Declaration 
"of Human Rights, are basically the freedom to follo"
w desire.  I remember reading in 
"one of the great philosophical cartoon strips, ‘Cal"
"vin and Hobbs’, about an American "
boy who had just learned from his teacher that igno
rance is bliss.  He knew it was 
guaranteed by the American constitution that you ha
d the right to the pursuit of 
"happiness.  So he added the two together and said, "
“If I’m guaranteed my right to 
"pursue happiness and ignorance is bliss, why am I g"
"oing to school?”  It’s strange, isn’t "
"it, what we talk about as freedoms in the world. "
Freedom of Expression 
118
"These things are not freedoms, they actually impris"
"on you.  For instance, consider the "
freedom to express yourself.  Do you actually feel 
free when you’ve got so much 
choice?  When you go into the supermarket or into t
"he shops, there is so much choice.  "
When there is so much choice it can make life so di
fficult.  Wasn’t it lovely when 
there was only one brand of muesli?  It was good en
"ough, you quite enjoyed it; but "
now you’ve got a choice between so many different b
rands.  That’s the problem with 
"freedom.  It’s just so complicated, so troublesome "
for the mind.  Sometimes freedom 
just gives you a headache.  What brand should I tak
e?  I’m challenging you here.  The 
whole idea of these talks is to make you look at th
ings in different ways.  Buddhism 
gives you a different perspective on things.  That’
"s half the job of mindfulness, to "
"open up different ways of looking, different ways o"
"f seeing, and different ways of "
practising. 
"So, instead of actually looking at freedom as the f"
"reedom to indulge desire, maybe we "
should aim for and aspire towards freedom from desi
re.  A Buddhist declaration of 
human rights would be very different from the human
 rights that people celebrate in 
the world.  They call it the Universal Declaration 
"of Human Rights, but I don’t think "
that they consulted Buddhists or anybody else for t
hat matter.  They just call it 
universal 
because 
it 
sounds 
universal 
to 
them. 
It’
s 
completely 
dogmatic 
and 
insensitive at times.  Obviously with human rights 
there are some things that all 
people would want to recognise as worth protecting.
  The aim of human rights is to 
protect.  All people want freedom from oppression a
nd freedom from being treated 
unfairly. 
We do need regulations and laws to protect the weak
 from the strong.  I think one of 
the goals of a declaration of human rights is to pr
otect the so called ‘level playing 
fields’.   This is not only to protect freedom of e
"xpression, of speech, but to protect "
religious expression as well.  I was quiet surprise
d in Singapore and Malaysia to find 
that Buddhists were afraid to express their religio
"n openly.  I expected it in Malaysia, "
because it’s a Muslim country.  Buddhists there are
 very afraid to express their 
"religion, especially when it comes to the point of "
building temples.  They are afraid to 
say exactly what they are doing because they would 
never be given building permits 
119
or be allowed to actually practise.  In one place w
"here they are building, they plan to "
plant trees on the edge of the property so that no 
one will be able see what is 
"happening inside, because the Malays might be upset"
 and stop them.  Sometimes they 
don’t even have a Buddha statue.  One meditation ce
ntre I went to was officially an 
"estate manager’s because, if they called it a medit"
"ation centre, they would be closed "
down. 
I had expected that in Malaysia but I was surprised
 that they were hypersensitive even 
in Singapore to what was going on.  I took part in 
a three-hour talk-back radio show in 
Singapore.  It was really good fun.  But the presen
ter told me beforehand not to 
mention Buddhism or the word meditation.  Otherwise
 he’d get the sack!  Because the 
people 
are 
so 
"hypersensitive, "
you 
couldn’t 
really 
e
xpress 
who 
you 
were. 
The 
organisers of the conference that I attended really
 thought that the riot police and the 
two ‘Black Marias’ – that I mentioned earlier – wer
e from the government.  So many 
people in the government in Singapore are heavy eva
ngelical Christians that the 
organizers were afraid because so many people were 
going to a Buddhist lecture. 
When we consider human rights or the idea of freedo
"m, we see that there are some "
things that should be done.  Giving people freedom 
"to choose, especially their religion "
"and allowing people to express their religion, is o"
ne example.  We should not be 
brainwashing people.  I heard today that someone ha
s bought the lease of a powerful 
transmitter in the Northern Territory and is 
blasti
ng Christian propaganda across 
South East Asia.  That’s not going to make us many 
friends in the Muslim world.  It’s 
a silly thing to do.  When pursuing human rights an
d freedom we have to be very 
"mindful and have loving kindness, compassion, and s"
ensitivity to the people around 
us. 
In Buddhism it’s not freedom for freedoms sake.  I 
can’t go and do just whatever I 
want or preach Buddhism to anybody I see.  That was
 one of the reasons I was 
personally very impressed with Buddhism.  The Buddh
ist monks and teachers I knew 
weren’t ramming Buddhism down my throat.  They were
n’t telling me that if I did not 
believe in Buddhism I would go to hell.  That happe
ns in some religions!  People have 
120
told me in Malaysia and Singapore that sometimes th
eir children come home from 
"school very upset, because the teachers tell them t"
hat their mummy and daddy are 
going to go to hell because they are Buddhists. 
"That is really too much.  So I told the Buddhists, "
"even in Malaysia, to stand up for "
themselves.  If any Christian comes and tells you t
"he Buddha wasn’t God, he wasn’t "
"even a prophet, he was just an ordinary man, say, “"
"Hang on, that’s only partly true!  "
It’s true the Buddha wasn’t a god.  It’s true he wa
"sn’t a prophet or a Son of God, but "
he 
was
 the teacher 
of God.

 where it is recorded that the Buddha went up to he
aven to see 
Brahma and taught him the 
Dhamma
. 
One of those exchanges is in the 
.
 Sutta in the 
'

(MN 49).  The Buddha went to see Brahma by using hi
"s psychic powers, but one of "
"the attendants in Brahmas assembly said, “Do you kn"
ow this is Brahma!  You should 
"go and bow down to him; he is God, the almighty, th"
"e creator, etc. etc. etc.”  The "
"Buddha replied, “No way, Brahma is making a big mis"
take.”  He tried to teach 
Brahma 
that 
he 
was 
subject 
to 
the 
law 
of 
kamma
and 
subject 
to 
the 
law 
of 
"impermanence, and that he had come to his present s"
tate from another world.  Brahma 
"was actually born into his role.  The role of God, "
"of Brahma, is just a job, a position "
which falls vacant at the end of the universe.  Som
eone else gets it next time.  That’s 
the Buddhist teaching.  Of course Brahma didn’t bel
ieve him.  The only thing that 
eventually convinced Brahma was a psychic contest. 
" Brahma said, “Look, I can "
121
"vanish, and you won’t be able to find me”, and the "
Buddha denied this.  According to 
the 
"
"
 the god tried to vanish but wherever Brahma went t
he Buddha followed.  I 
think that is because Brahma lives in the highest o
f the sensory realms and he can go 
from there into the first 
jhana
 realm.  But when the Buddha went into the second 
jhana
realm that was beyond Brahma’s conception and exper
"ience, he couldn’t find the "
"Buddha.  The Buddha won the psychic contest and, be"
"cause of that, Brahma realised "
that this was no ordinary person and started to lis
ten and understand the laws of 
impermanence.  He understood that he wasn’t a perma
nent being in this universe.  He 
"wasn’t the almighty, the permanent, etc.  He unders"
tood he was just like any other 
"being, "
subject to 
the law 
of 
kamma
", "
subject 
to 
impermanence.  
That 
was 
when 
Brahma became a disciple of the Buddha. 
"So, if anyone knocks on your door and asks if you b"
"elieve in God, you can say, “Yes, "
but we also believe in the Buddha and that the Budd
ha is your God’s teacher”.  That 
way you will get rid of them pretty quickly.  Only 
say this if they get heavy with you 
because we want to be diplomatic.  We want to be ki
"nd, but sometimes it’s worth "
fighting fire with fire.  Buddhists should at least
" stand up for their beliefs, understand "
"what their beliefs are, and not just be wimps. "
Freedom of Inquiry 
I 
spoke in Malaysia about such things as the Gnosti
c 
"gospels, which is another "
tradition of Christianity.  In early Christianity t
here were three strands of Christian 
"belief.  One was the church at Jerusalem, which was"
 basically a Jewish Christianity.  
They were still circumcising each other and keeping
 the Jewish traditions.  It wasn’t 
very popular with the Gentiles in Rome because they
 didn’t have anaesthetic in those 
days.  The Gentile church was found in many other c
entres outside of Jerusalem.  
"Places like Antioch, Corinth, and Rome.  Then there"
 were the Gnostic Christians.  
They weren’t centred anywhere but were an independe
nt strand of Christianity with 
no hierarchy or organisation but with groups of peo
ple meeting in many different 
places. 
122
"When Jerusalem fell in 70AD, because the Romans wer"
e – for one reason or another – 
"fed up with the Jewish people, they tore down the t"
emple and dispersed the people.  
This action destroyed the Jewish Christian church a
nd from then on it was a contest 
between the Gnostic Christians and the much better 
"organised, more powerful, Roman "
Christians.  Little by little – this is just basic 
history not Ajahn Brahm making it up – 
the 
Gnostic 
Christians 
were 
"suppressed, "
considered 
"heretics, "
and 
eventually 
annihilated by the Roman Christians.  They were kil
"led, their books were burned, and "
their libraries were destroyed. 
It’s 
strange 
but 
when 
you 
try 
and 
suppress 
anything
", "
when 
you 
try 
and 
hide 
"something, especially bad "
kamma
" or mistakes, it usually turns up again somewhere! "
"In 1945 somebody, in a place called Nag Hammadi in "
"southern Egypt, found some old "
"texts, old papyrus manuscripts, dating I think to t"
"he first and second centuries AD, "
which came to be called the Gnostic Gospels.  They 
can be seen at the Nag Hammadi 
Library.  In these texts there are actual sayings o
"f Jesus Christ that are very, very "
different from what we read in the Bible.  If you a
re interested in another form of 
Christianity it’s 
very interesting to read things t
hat give a different slant to that 
religion.  You can look up a book called ‘The Gnost
"ic Gospels’ by Elaine Pagels, who "
is professor of Religious Studies at Princetown Uni
versity in America.  The reason 
I’m saying this is because one of the teachings in 
the texts quotes Jesus as saying that 
"God was in his heaven one day saying, “I am the fir"
"st born, the creator, the lord of all "
"that is and ever was, the most powerful, etc., etc."
"”.  Then someone says, “No you’re "
not.  Don’t get above yourself God.  There are othe
r beings in this universe which you 
"simply do not know about.”  God replied, “Who said "
that?  Why are you saying that?”  
"That is in the Gnostic Christian Gospels, which put"
s God in a very different place 
from that depicted in Roman Christianity. 
I mention this because when we have more knowledge 
"and understanding, when we "
"have more information, we get a much wider and broa"
der picture of things.  It’s that 
wider knowledge that is one of the things that shou
ld be a basic freedom for all human 
beings.  Knowledge should be freely available.  It 
shouldn’t be slanted or biased 
according to certain people’s views or religion’s a
gendas. 
123
"There are some freedoms that we love to have, that "
are really our right.  One of those 
freedoms that we would certainly put in a Buddhist 
charter of human rights is the right 
"to freedom of inquiry, freedom of information, and "
freedom to question.  It is by 
questioning that we find the truth.  The Buddha enc
ouraged us not to just sit back and 
"listen, or to only take a book and study it, but to"
 also question.  One of the 
"suttas"
 lists 
the 
five 
things 
that 
help 
one 
become 
a 
Stream 
Winne
"r, "
(the 
first 
stage 
of 
Enlightenment). 
It 
starts 
off 
with 
 
", "
"virtue, "
"morality, "
keeping 
precepts 
and 
continues with these two beautiful words 
"
"
 and 

.  
"
"
 means literally 
‘listening 
to 
Dhamma
discourses’. 
You 
might 
call 
it 
learning 
or 
having
the 
informational input about the Buddha’s teachings.  

 means ‘discussion and 
"asking questions’.  The other two factors, interest"
"ingly, are "
samatha
 and 
vipassana
","
calm 
and 
insight. 
These 
are 
the 
five 
supporting 
fa
ctors 
for 
the 
arising 
of 
Enlightenment.  Here I’m just focussing on 
"
"
 and 

", the ability to have the "
information and also to discuss it. 
One of the things that really attracted me to Buddh
ism was that I could ask any 
"question, even though they were sometimes silly que"
"stions, because the teachers "
respected and honoured questioning.  Those teachers
 would never make a questioner 
"feel silly or embarrassed by saying, “What a stupid"
" question that is, you foolish "
person.  Don’t ask that question again.”  I’ve trie
d all my life never to do that.  If 
"someone asks me a question, even though I sometimes"
" think, “What a dumb question, "
haven’t you been listening?” I always try to answer
 it fully.  I’ve had some dumb 
questions in my time.  Probably the hardest and mos
t foolish question I was ever 
"asked was when I was giving a talk, many years ago,"
 to fourteen year old girls in a 
"high school.  After my talk on Buddhism, I expected"
" the questions to be on Buddhism, "
"but this one girl put her hand up and asked, “Do gi"
rls turn you on?”  That was a hard 
one to handle.  Whenever I asked a dumb question – 
although I never asked questions 
like that of monks!! – the monk would always be ver
y patient with me and would 
"actually explain very gently saying, “Look, you’re "
misunderstanding; you should have 
asked the question in this way”.  But they would ne
ver make you feel small because 
you had asked a stupid question.  I really apprecia
ted that because it showed a sense 
of kindness and respect.  The teacher respected the
 student. 
124
To question is a right for people.  That’s why I sa
"y, “Whatever question you have, "
come and ask it.  I may not know the answer.  It ma
"y take me a while, and sometimes "
"you may not be satisfied with my answer, but always"
 ask the question”.  Often when 
"people ask questions and I reply, I ask them if the"
 answer is okay.  “Did I answer the 
question satisfactorily?”  “Did I understand the qu
estion?”  That’s respect for the 
person who had the guts to put their hand up and as
k. 
I act like this because of my own past experience. 
 Sometimes I’ve asked a question 
"and because the person hasn’t really understood it,"
 or because the question is simply a 
"bit too hard for them, or it’s showing them they’ve"
" made a mistake, they skirt around "
"it or make a joke of it.  I remember Krishnamurti, "
the teacher – I was quite interested 
in his teachings for a while.  Later I heard a reco
rding of one his talks given in the 
New York Library.  It was quite a famous talk.  I’v
e seen the audio cassette in public 
libraries.  I was really interested in the talk and
 at the end there were a lot of stupid 
questions.  Krishnamurti answered those questions r
"easonably well, but then someone "
"asked a really good question, which was very deep a"
nd challenged much of what he 
"had said.  I was disgusted when the answer was, wit"
h a very condescending and 
"superior voice, “Do I have to answer everything?”  "
The audience laughed.  But this 
poor 
man 
was 
ridiculed 
even 
though 
it 
was 
the 
best 
question 
of 
the 
session.  
"Krishnamurti just skirted around it with humour, an"
d I thought that was really wrong. 
I tell people that if lecturers at universities rea
"lly know their stuff, if they are really "
"experts at their subjects, they can answer any ques"
tions.  If they skirt around questions 
"or are afraid of questions, it’s a good sign that t"
hey don’t know what they are talking 
about.  I told the people in Malaysia and Singapore
", and I give the same advice to you:  "
there 
are 
so 
many 
teachers 
and 
"Gurus, "
monks 
and 
nun
s 
and 
goodness 
knows 
"whatever, floating around the world today; you shou"
ld ask them difficult questions.  
That’s the only way to find out if they know their 
stuff.  Ask them the hardest 
"questions, the most probing questions, and see if t"
hey answer them with a sense of 
"equanimity, with a sense of respect – not like a po"
litician avoiding the issue but like 
someone who knows what they are talking about.  If 
"you know, you are not afraid of "
125
questions.  This is a good way for people to check 
"on teachers, on Gurus, on monks, "
or nuns who go around the world teaching.  There is
 a huge danger in believing 
charlatans.  So ask deep questions. 
I think in any charter of Buddhist human rights we 
should have the right to question 
anybody 
and 
the 
right 
to 
demand 
a 
fair 
"answer, "
whet
her 
it’s 
from 
"politicians, "
"preachers, or whoever, because I think that would p"
"rotect truth, and access to the truth "
"should be an inalienable right for people, an inali"
enable right for all.  Find out what 
your governments are doing.  Find out what your doc
"tor says about you, what they "
have diagnosed you as having.  But especially in re
ligion we should have the freedom 
to find out the truth. 
Defining the Boundaries 
"We also need some checks and balances, because we n"
eed boundaries for everybody.  
Sometimes when we don’t understand the meaning of f
"reedom, we remove all the "
"boundaries, "
whether 
in 
the 
practice 
of 
"religion, "
or
in 
the 
practice 
of 
education.  
Whether it’s living together as a family or just in
" general life, we don’t put boundaries "
in place because we think freedom means ‘no boundar
ies’.  We get into all sorts of 
confusion.  In fact one of the speakers at this con
"ference, who I didn’t really respect, "
said she was a Buddhist without boundaries.  I was 
not at all inspired by her.  Why do 
you 
even 
call 
yourself a 
Buddhist 
if 
you 
don’t 
have
 any 
boundaries? 
To 
be a 
Buddhist you’ve got to have boundaries.  I accept s
ome statements and ideas but not 
"others, otherwise why call yourself a Buddhist.  Wh"
y not call yourself a Buddhist-
Christian-Jewish-Moslem-Atheist-freethinker?  That’
s not having boundaries.  The 
"point is, it’s good to have boundaries. "
"Sometimes people say, “I’m not anything, I don’t ca"
ll myself a Buddhist.  If you’re a 
"Buddhist, that’s just being attached to a label, to"
" a name”.  I ask them, “Are you a "
man?  Are you a woman?  Aren’t you just attached to
 that label?  If you are not 
"attached to that label, when you go to the toilet w"
"hich one do you go to, the ‘Men’s’ "
or the ‘Ladies?”  If you are not attached to being 
a man go to the ladies toilet and see 
what happens.  You can see what intellectual garbag
e this is.  I sometimes get really 
126
embarrassed by my fellow Buddhists.  Tina Turner wh
"en asked by a reporter, “Why "
"are you a Buddhist?’ replied, “Because as a Buddhis"
t I can do anything I like”.  That’s 
not being a Buddhist.  Buddhists have boundaries.  
"Creatures have boundaries, and "
it’s the boundaries that define who you are.  You c
"all yourself a man, because that "
"means you are not a woman, you’re not an animal, an"
d you’re not a 
#
.  You are a 
man.  If you call yourself a Buddhist it defines yo
u as a Buddhist.  Whether it’s 
"Tibetan, "
'
", "
(#
", Zen, or whatever, there are certain things that t"
hose 
labels require.  At least you have got to believe t
hat the Buddha was Enlightened.  If 
"you think, “Well I don’t know if the Buddha was enl"
ightened or not.  Sometimes I 
believe in the Buddha but sometimes I believe in Je
"sus Christ, and sometimes I "
believe in the Great White Ram!”  What sort of Budd
hist is that?  That’s just a person 
who is incredibly confused.  They are never going t
o get anywhere in this life.  If 
you’re going to go to Fremantle you’ve got to get o
n a bus that has Fremantle written 
on the front otherwise you will never get there.  Y
"ou don’t have to go to Fremantle, "
"you can go to South Perth, or you can go to Wannero"
"o, but at least choose the right "
bus and just sit on it until you get there. 
If you are a Buddhist you should learn what the Bud
dha really said and what it means 
to be a Buddhist.  But not just according to your o
wn ideas.  Buddhist means ‘of the 
"Buddha’, ‘something to do with the Buddha’.  The Bu"
ddha was a historical person.  
"Everyone, even atheist sceptics, accept that much. "
 The Buddha lived in India twenty-
"six centuries ago, and there is a lot written about"
 him.  Not just in old books but also 
"in stone, in actual carvings on ancient temples.  T"
here are also carvings on stone 
pillars erected by the Emperor Asoka.  The Buddha e
"xisted, there’s no doubt about "
that.  With some of the other teachers we’re not qu
ite so sure. 
You have to know what it was that the Buddha taught
 to be a Buddhist.  You have to 
have some degree of faith and confidence in those t
eachings.  They have to make 
sense to you.  The reason I became a Buddhist was b
ecause I read a book about 
Buddhism that made sense to me.  I read other books
" at the same time, the Koran and "
the Bible.  They didn’t make so much sense.  By say
ing you are a Buddhist you are 
"not criticising other religions, you are saying wha"
t 
you
 are.  In the same way as being 
127
"a woman, you say you are a woman.  You are not crit"
"icising men, you are just "
describing yourself.  This is clear thinking.  You 
are giving yourself a description that 
describes your reality at that particular time.  Wi
th that description you take on the 
responsibilities and duties of that reality.  A Bud
dhist is someone who believes in the 
"Buddha – in other words someone who follows, as bes"
"t they can, what the Buddha "
taught.  Some Buddhists perform all of sorts of ela
borate acts of worship.  We talked 
about this in Malaysia where they call it ‘joss-sti
ck Buddhism’.  You might have seen 
joss-stick Buddhists they hold these joss sticks in
 their hands and sway backwards and 
forwards.  They haven’t a clue why they are doing t
his.  They go backwards and 
forwards like this because they have always seen th
eir parents and their grand parents 
doing it.  Then they put the joss-sticks into a jar
.  That’s not what the Buddha taught. 
The Buddha taught that if you want to worship him –
 and this is in the 
'
ā
-
%!!
ā

"Sutta"
 (DN 16) – you should follow his advice.  A Buddhis
t is really 
someone who has gone for refuge to the Buddha and i
s practising the Eightfold Path 
as 
closely 
as 
possible. 
Whether 
it’s 
Zen 
"Buddhism,"
'
a

"Buddhism, "
or 
"whatever type of Buddhism, the one thing in Buddhis"
m that everyone has in common 
is the Eightfold Path.  In 
'
 Buddhism they’ve got six 

", or perfections, "
three of those are 
 
", "
samadhi
 and 
Panna
", which is the eightfold path.  No matter "
"what form of Buddhism it is, you have to have "
 
", virtue.  You have to have right "
view and keep the precepts.  You have to have 
samadhi

Panna
 or wisdom. 
"So, first of all learn what the Buddha taught.  Try"
 and realize it.  See if it makes sense 
"or not, and in the meantime question it.  Listen to"
 find out what Buddhism is all about.  
Question it to make sure you understand properly wh
"at the Buddha said, not believing "
it yet.  Then try it out to see if it works by prac
tising it for yourself. 
Freedom of Mind 
Sometimes 
people 
think 
that 
keeping 
rules 
and 
havin
g 
laws 
is 
restricting 
their 
freedom.  That’s why some human rights conflict wit
h the laws.  There is a conflict in 
128
many countries between laws which are designed to p
rotect 
society and to 
give 
"freedom from bullying, freedom from disruption, fre"
edom for a person to enjoy their 
"property, their time, and their own religion, and w"
hat people call the ‘freedom to do 
what they want’.  I think this is the problem with 
the way that human rights are 
espoused at the present time.  In Buddhism we reali
se – and the Buddha said this – 
that we gain freedom only within boundaries.  We ga
"in a lot of confusion, pain, and "
"suffering, when we don’t have boundaries.  Look at "
your marriage.  If you’ve no 
"boundaries, no rules, what sort of marriage have yo"
u got?  The husband if he likes a 
"girl can just go there, be free; and the same for w"
ife.  What sort of life would that be?  
To be able to have harmony and peace we do need rul
es. 
During my talks in Singapore and Malaysia I gave th
e simile of the fish in a tank – are 
they free or are they in prison?  Is it ‘Buddhist’ 
to put fish in a tank or should they be 
"swimming free in the seas, the lakes, and the river"
s?  What have they done to get put 
in prison?  Sometimes people look at the aquarium a
"nd think it’s a prison, don’t they?  "
But that’s misunderstanding freedom.  The meaning o
f that particular simile is that the 
"fish in the tank are free from fishermen, free from"
" bigger fish, and they are free from "
too much cold and too much heat.  The temperature i
s controlled and they’ve got free 
"medical care because, if they are sick, the owner w"
ill come and see them and make 
sure they are okay.  They get free food delivered t
o them once a day.  Fast food:  they 
"don’t even have to ring up for the delivery boy, it"
 just comes to them!  The fish in the 
"tank are free from so many problems.  That’s why, w"
"hen I really think about it, if I "
was a fish I’d rather be a fish in an aquarium than
" a fish in the sea or in the ocean, in "
"the rivers or lakes.  I can swim back and forth, I "
wouldn’t be able to go as far as other 
fish but I would be so happy.  I wouldn’t have to w
orry about anything.  I’d be just 
sitting in the corner of the aquarium with my fins 
crossed meditating quite happily! 
Now you may understand monks.  We put ourselves in 
a monastery with a large wall 
around it and people bring us food every day just l
ike a fish in an aquarium.  But to 
live that life we have to put boundaries around our
selves.  Our boundaries are all the 
rules of discipline which we have to keep.  This is
 something that people don’t 
"understand about monks and nuns, especially the lad"
y who said she was a Buddhist 
without boundaries.  Without boundaries there’s no 
freedom at all.  In fact people who 
"try that, who indulge in whatever pleasure or senso"
"ry aberration they like, who sleep "
129
"around with this partner and that partner, get so c"
"onfused, so depressed. We used to "
call these people ‘screwed up’ in their minds.  Tha
t is no inner freedom whatsoever.  
There is just so much pain.  That’s the reason that
 places like California – I’m not sure 
if 
"it’s true, "
but 
I 
think 
it’s 
pretty 
accurate 
– pr
obably 
have 
the 
highest 
ratio 
of 
psychotherapists per unit of population of anywhere
 in the world.  One of the reasons 
for that is that there is a lack of freedom of mind
. 
So freedom really needs boundaries.  If we keep pre
cepts we feel free.  The more 
precepts we keep the more free we feel.  It’s the s
ame with meditation.  Some people 
say meditation is so hard – you have to think of th
e breath but you don’t want to think 
"of the breath, you want to think about your dinner "
this evening.  If you think of the 
breath isn’t that just another prison?  That’s why 
people sometimes even have the 
nerve to say that you can be attached to meditation
.  They really don’t know the 
"difference between freedom and attachment, between "
liberty and being in a prison.  If 
you watch the breath and just keep yourself on the 
"breath, you don’t go anywhere "
else.  If you put yourself in a jail with iron bars
" around the breath, you can’t go "
"anywhere.  Do that for twenty minutes, half an hour"
", or an hour and you feel so much "
"bliss, "
the 
mind 
actually 
feels 
free. 
That 
is 
one 
o
f 
the 
fascinating 
insights 
of 
Buddhism.  In fact the Buddha called those states t
he ‘states of 
"
"
 ’ and that 
literally means freedom or liberation of the mind. 
It’s strange but you have to put yourself into only
 one small part of the present 
moment to gain liberation of the mind.  You can’t e
"ven talk, that’s against the rules.  "
Imagine trying to impose that on people!  On medita
tion retreats we impose ‘noble 
silence’ and only allow people to eat in the mornin
gs.  If Amnesty International found 
out about our meditation retreats they’d probably c
omplain.  That’s what is called 
"unusual punishment, unusual forms of torture.  I wo"
uld think they would have a 
strong case for banning it.  People who go to those
" retreats at first, because they can’t "
"talk, feel so uncomfortable.  But after two or thre"
e days the discomfort disappears and 
they actually feel freedom.  They are free from the
 necessity of having to talk and 
having to relate to people on that level.  They lea
rn how to relate on another level.  
"There is so much freedom when you’re silent, so muc"
h more freedom when you stay 
on one point.  What looks like a prison is actually
 the fullest liberty.  It’s called 
"release, and it’s the wisdom that is the truth. "
130
It’s a very narrow truth.  The truth of Buddhism is
" ‘impermanence’, ‘suffering’ and "
‘non-self’.  People often think that’s such a small
 thing.  Why believe that?  You’re 
just attached to one way of looking at things.  Som
e people say that that’s being 
attached to one view and real freedom is having any
" view, any view you like.  You "
can believe in impermanence today and believe in pe
rmanence the next day.  You can 
believe in God.  You can believe in whatever you li
ke.  Nothing is right and nothing is 
wrong.  Some philosophers end up by saying that the
"re is no good and there is no bad, "
"it’s all relative.  They say, "
"in other words, "
that 
"whatever you like is good, and "
whatever you don’t like is bad.  It depends on how 
you feel; truth is relative.  Anyone 
"who believes in absolute truth is dogmatic, just st"
uck in one way of thinking.  But 
actually the opposite is true.  If you have right v
"iew, you feel so free.  It’s not being in "
a prison; it’s liberty.  It’s okay to say what you 
think is right and stand up for it. 
Conclusion 
"Don’t be a freethinker, which means that you think,"
" think, and think.  Be a ‘no "
"thinker’.  Be a knower, not a thinker.  All thinkin"
g is a sign that you don’t know.  If 
"you knew why would you think?  It’s true, just thin"
"k about that.  So, here I’m putting "
"out some different ideas about Buddhism, ideas that"
 actually show that human rights 
are 
a 
central 
pillar 
of 
our 
society. 
They 
mean 
a 
l
ot 
to 
us 
because 
they 
have 
"consequences for the way we live our lives, consequ"
"ences for the laws of our society, "
and consequences for the way we do things. 
Let us have another look at human rights from a Bud
"dhist perspective, from the "
perspective of 
kamma
.  
Sometimes we have to suffer.  We know why – it’s be
cause 
we deserve it.  We caused it!  Equality is the equa
"lity of opportunity, the opportunity "
to make good 
kamma
 and to have happiness.  All people are not born eq
ual because 
they have all started from different places.  Equal
ity is in the equality to perform good 
kamma
 and the equality to rise in happiness and leave su
ffering behind.  So we 
"recognise the differences in people, even from the "
time of their birth.  People are not 
"all born equal, but they should have equality of op"
"portunity, and that’s a beautiful "
thing in Buddhism. 
131
Everyone has the opportunity to make good 
kamma
.  It doesn’t matter how much you 
are experiencing the results of bad 
kamma
" at this moment.  If you’re very sick, very "
"ill, if you’ve just lost your job, or you’re disabl"
"ed, if you’ve just been in an accident, a "
"divorce, or whatever else, there is always an equal"
ity of opportunity to take hold of 
your life.  You can turn your life around to that w
"hich is truly wholesome, beautiful, "
and good at any stage of your life.  You can do tha
t!  That’s why Buddhism doesn’t 
"believe in fate, in the sense that, ‘Oh, I’m hopele"
ss.  I’m not destined to have a nice 
"life’ or ‘I can’t become a monk’, ‘I can’t become a"
" nun’.  In Malaysia people said, "
"“Well, it’s alright for you; you were born with suc"
h good 
kamma
", that’s why you’re a "
monk.  But I haven’t got good 
kamma
".  I can’t become a monk”.  I ask, “How do you "
know?”  I always tell people to give it a chance an
d see what happens.  Test it out and 
see if you have good enough 
kamma
 to become a monk.  Give it a try.  The point is 
we can always do something. 
One of the other things which impressed me in Buddh
"ism, was that even a person who "
"was a prostitute, someone who went crazy, and a ser"
"ial killer, were all examples of "
people 
who 
eventually 
became 
Enlightened. 
In 
Buddh
ism 
people 
with 
terrible 
kamma
" had the freedom of opportunity, even in this life,"
 to get to the very highest 
achievements. 
I think it is a good idea to enshrine in human righ
ts not just equality between men and 
"women, but more importantly to enshrine "
equality of opportunity
.  Opportunity for 
men should be the same as opportunity for women.  I
t should be the same opportunity 
"for any gender, any race, and any religion, because"
 that is the Buddhist principle – not 
a Western Christian principle but Buddhist principl
es.  With the Buddhist principle of 
forgiveness and kindness it is not necessary to ens
hrine punishment into human rights.  
Nowadays the victims of crime want to be the ones w
ho punish the criminals.  I’m not 
"sure that is the law yet, but it seems to be coming"
.  We seem to be enshrining in law 
"the right to inflict revenge on somebody else, basi"
cally the right of an eye for an eye.  
But that’s Judeo-Christian and Islamic; it has no p
lace in Buddhism.  In Buddhism we 
have the right to forgive.  It’s good to forgive so
"mebody else, but it is also a human "
right and also freeing to forgive yourself as well.
  That’s a powerful freedom.  It took 
me a long time to change my conditioning on reward 
and punishment.  If you are 
132
guilty you have to be punished!  You have to be spa
"nked, or go to your room, go "
"without your dinner, or some other punishment.  If "
you don’t get that punishment 
from someone else you inflict it on yourself.  Budd
hist human rights are the right to 
forgive and let go. 
These 
are 
just 
some 
reflections 
on 
human 
rights 
fro
m 
a 
Buddhist 
perspective.  
Sometimes we think that the Declaration of Human Ri
"ghts is universal, applicable to "
"all people in this world, just because it came from"
 America and Europe.  I think that 
America and Europe need to look at the different cu
"ltures that make up our world, not "
"just Buddhist culture but also Aboriginal cultures,"
 to make these declarations relevant.  
"Instead of just calling them universal, first of al"
l find out what the people of this world 
"actually feel:  consult them, instead of just impos"
ing these ideals that do not have a 
foundation in all cultures.  The speaker at this co
"nference was suggesting, and I "
"thought it was a marvellous idea, that this declara"
tion of human rights is far from 
perfect.  Let the Buddhists have an input.  Rework 
it.  Otherwise it’s not really 
applicable and it doesn’t make sense to many people
.  There are different ways of 
"looking at things, and to look at things in differe"
nt ways is called wisdom. 
"These are some points on Buddhism and human rights,"
 freedom and everything else.  
"But it’s just a start, because the whole debate and"
 investigation isn’t over yet.

MEDITATION 
Fremantle Zendo 
21
st
 June 2000 
I’m very pleased to have the opportunity to come an
d speak to you all.  This is 
actually the second time that I speak to the Zen gr
oup.  I want to talk this evening 
about something that is of use and benefit to every
one who meditates.  This evening’s 
talk is on 
jhana
" meditation of the Thai forest tradition, because I"
 thought it would be 
very useful to everybody here. 
The Heart of Buddhist Practice 
Everyone would know that the Buddha became Enlighte
ned by sitting under a tree 
and meditating.  Meditation is the heart of Buddhis
t practice and that which has set it 
apart from other practices and religions.  As far a
s my historical understanding is 
"concerned, I cannot see that there was any practise"
" of meditation, certainly not any "
"quiet meditation, prior to the time of the Buddha. "
 It’s as if he rediscovered this path 
with meditation at its heart.  Even though meditati
"on is mentioned in the Upanishads, "
"my understanding, and that of Indian academics, is "
that those texts date to after the 
time of the Buddha.  The old 
Pali
 word for meditation was 
jhana
.  This is a very 
"important word because as you know, when the Buddhi"
"st tradition went to China, "
jhana
 became Chan and from Chan we get Zen.  So this is 
the historical context for 
the roots of meditation. 
The way of meditation in the Thai Forest tradition 
is the way of just ‘letting go’.  
Many people in our world would like to understand h
ow to let go because we have 
"many problems and difficulties, and many attachment"
s.  The fundamental teaching of 
the Buddha is that an attachment to certain things 
leads to suffering.  So we need to 
understand how to let go of those attachments.  We 
do this through meditation; this is 
the process of letting go. 
One of the first things that impressed me about med
"itation is that the more you let go, "
the more happiness comes into your mind.  The path 
of meditation is the path of 
happiness.  In fact the more you smile – I don’t kn
ow if you are allowed to smile in 
134
the Zendo – but the more you smile the more it’s a 
sign that you understand about the 
letting go of suffering.  Another thing that impres
sed me in Buddhism was the fact 
"that the Buddhist monks I met were very happy, espe"
"cially people like Ajahn Chah, "
my teacher in Thailand.  Not only was the teacher h
"appy but also, when I read the "
"suttas"
", I found time and time again that the Buddha was a"
 very happy monk.  The 
people who went to see the Buddha when he was passi
"ng through the monasteries, "
such as the great Jeta Grove Monastery outside 

ā

ī
", would always comment on "
"how happy the community, the "
$&
", looked and how much they smiled. "
I said in Singapore recently that the greatest mark
eting tool for Buddhism is the 
"serene smile of a happy meditator.  Because, when a"
 person sees that the practice of 
meditation gives rise to happiness and the ending o
"f suffering and distress, then they "
too will want to follow that path.  They too will w
ant to share that smile.  That 
certainly is the story of my practise of Buddhism. 
 I went to Thailand for one reason:  
"of all the monks I’d seen in the city of London, wh"
"ere I was born, it was the happy "
smiling Thai monks who impressed me the most.  I th
ought that if Buddhism was 
"going to give anything, if it was going to work, th"
en the happiness I saw in those 
monks is what I wanted to share. 
Happiness is just the end of suffering and it is th
at which encourages people to follow 
the Buddhist path.  That happiness is born of letti
ng go and the process of meditation 
is what generates it.  But the happiness and medita
tion have to be grounded on the 
ease of the body and a very virtuous lifestyle.  I’
m sure that everyone would agree 
with me that it’s very difficult to sit meditation 
"in the Zendo, or in a meditation hall of "
"any tradition, if, beforehand, you’ve been acting u"
nskilfully with your body and 
speech.  What I mean by unskilful is doing somethin
g that hurts or harms oneself or 
"another.  If one cannot let go of such stupidity, t"
hen it’s so hard to let go of more 
"refined things, and to develop the peaceful state o"
f meditation. 
"That’s the reason in the Thai Forest tradition, why"
 meditation is grounded on a very 
"pure life style, a lifestyle of harmlessness, a lif"
"estyle of compassion, a lifestyle of the "
purity of conduct of all the senses.  Having achiev
"ed that degree of purity, there is a "
path of letting go in this meditation.  You underst
and from your own experience what 
135
letting go means because when you let go of any obs
"tacle, of any attachment, you "
experience peace.  The sign of letting go is the pe
ace and happiness which arises in 
the mind.  That’s why I think many of you would und
erstand that one of the objects of 
meditation is 
samadhi
.  
Samadhi
 is the ability to sustain the attention on one thi
ng 
with calmness and stillness. 
The Path of ‘Letting Go’ 
"However, recently when I went to teach meditation a"
nd Buddhism in Malaysia and 
Singapore there was a syndrome which I had never me
t before in the Thai Forest 
tradition.  It was what they called ‘
samadhi
 headache’.  I don’t know if you get Zen 
"headaches, but if you do you are going in the wrong"
 direction.  You can imagine 
"yuppies in Malaysia and Singapore, always trying to"
 control and manipulate their 
lives. 
When 
they 
sat 
meditation 
they 
were 
controll
ing 
and 
manipulating 
their 
meditation as well.  That is going in the complete 
opposite direction to the Buddha’s 
teaching.  They were meditating to get somewhere.  
(
hey were meditating to control 
"their body, control their minds, and they were gett"
ing into the tension called ‘
samadhi
headache’.  I told them that I had never heard of t
his before. 
There is something that is important to overcome on
 the path of meditation.  

 is 
the path of letting go more and more.  The core tea
chings of 
(#
 are the Four 
Noble Truths.  The second and third ones are what I
 am going to point to this evening.  
"The second truth is craving, which is the cause of "
suffering.  The third truth is letting 
"go, letting go is the meaning of "
!!
","
 ultimate happiness.  One of the sayings of 
the Buddha in the 
suttas
" is, “"
!!
" is the highest happiness”, and it’s that point of "
happiness which becomes the carrot on this path of 
meditation.  The more you let go 
the more happiness you have. 
The first things that we teach in the Forest tradit
ion are the stages of letting go.  Just 
"like any other process, there has to be a methodica"
l stage by stage abandoning:  first 
"the coarse things, then the more refined, then the "
"abandoning of the very refined, until "
you can let go of everything.  It is just like a ca
rpenter who is going to make a 
beautiful piece of furniture.  He takes wood from t
he wood yard and first of all planes 
it down to get rid of the rough edges and the burrs
 which are caused by the saw.  
136
"Having planed off the rough parts, he uses the coar"
"sest sandpaper, and then medium "
sandpaper. and then fine sandpaper.  After using th
e finest sandpaper and smoothing 
"the wood as much as possible, he’ll finish off with"
 a cloth and some oil or some wax 
to fine polish this beautiful piece of wood.  If yo
u start with the polishing cloth on the 
rough piece of wood you’ll waste a lot of polishing
 cloths!  This is a simile for the 
letting go procedure. 
Abiding in the Present Moment 
This was the way that we were taught by some of the
 great teachers of North East 
"Thailand, and this was the way they practised.  The"
y would sit for hours in peace and 
"happiness with a smile on their face, which in turn"
 would give rise to the wisdom in 
their teachings.  The way they did this was first o
f all to abandon the past and the 
future and to abide in the present moment.  This is
" such a simple thing, but it is such a "
valuable thing to do on the path of meditation.  No
 matter what you are focussing your 
"attention on, whether it’s on an object or on silen"
"ce, it’s so easy just to linger on the "
past and think of what happened earlier.  The past 
"is just a memory, the future is just a "
"dream, and once you’ve completely abandoned them yo"
u are in the present moment. 
During a recent retreat I was talking a lot and I m
ade a slip of the tongue:  instead of 
calling it the ‘present moment’ I called it the ‘pl
easant moment’.  I didn’t mind that 
slip of the tongue because it was very true.  The p
resent moment is very pleasant 
because you are letting go of so many burdens.  As 
a monk with many duties and 
responsibilities I abide very often in the present 
"moment.  In other words, when I "
come here I’ve got no monastery and I’ve got no Bud
dhist Society in Nollamara.  
When I’m here I’m just a monk sitting here in the Z
"endo.  All the past is abandoned, "
and I don’t imagine the future.  A good illustratio
n of this comes from a very famous 
Thai monk who died recently in the South of Thailan
d.   He was building a huge 
meditation hall in his monastery.  When the rainy s
eason came (which in our tradition 
means we go on retreat for three months and all wor
k is stopped) and the retreat 
started the roof was only half completed.  So when 
people came and visited that 
monastery 
they 
would 
ask 
this 
great 
"monk, "
“When 
is 
your 
hall 
going 
to 
be 
completed?”  He looked at them and said “It is fini
shed”.  They looked back at him 
"saying, “How can you say it’s finished?  The roof i"
"s not finished yet, there are no "
"windows, there are no doors, and it hasn’t been pai"
"nted yet.  What do you mean, ‘it’s "
137
"finished’?”  He would reply, “What’s done is finish"
ed”.  That was a beautiful teaching 
This is what you should do just before you meditate
":  say, “What’s done is finished”, "
so you don’t take all your so-called unfinished bus
"iness into your meditation.  Please, "
do not be a person who has to get everything out of
 the way before you meditate.  If 
you do that you’ll find you’ll never have the time 
to meditate.  If you try and get 
"everything perfect and tie up all your loose ends, "
you’ll find you’ll be dead before you 
can meditate.  Loose ends are the normal state of l
"ife, and there is always more work "
to be done.  There is always a mess in the kitchen 
to clean up.  What are you living for 
– to help to clean the kitchen or to have a peacefu
l mind?  So meditation becomes 
important or rather the ‘present moment’ becomes im
portant.  What you’re doing here 
is letting go of a lot of business; you’re focussin
g on the only truth you have which is 
‘here and now’. 
Sometimes monks tend to focus so much on the presen
t moment that they sometimes 
forget 
what 
hour 
it 
"is, "
what 
day 
it 
is. 
In 
my 
earl
y 
years 
as 
a 
monk 
with 
no 
responsibilities – and this is no joke – I even for
got what year it was.  One day was 
very much like the next in those monasteries in the
 jungles of North East Thailand.  
You had this beautiful feeling of being in the time
less present moment. 
Letting go should be your first goal in the meditat
ion.  The sign of letting go is 
freedom.  Sometimes people are afraid of freeing th
emselves.  Fear is one of the 
hindrances to abandonment.  We are so attached to o
ur past because it defines us.  It’s 
from the past that we have built up our feeling of 
"self, of who we think we are.  We "
are attached to the future because we think if we p
"lan then we’ll find some security, "
some safety. 
Some Thai monks tell fortunes and people would some
"times come up to my teacher, "
"Ajahn Chah, this great meditator, and ask him to te"
ll their fortunes.  Ajahn Chah 
would always out of compassion and wisdom agree to 
"do so.  He would say to them, "
"“Madam or sir, I’ll tell you your fortune.  Your fu"
ture is uncertain.”  He was always 
right!  So why worry about things that we do not kn
ow will happen?  How many 
times have you worried about going to the dentist f
or example?  You worry yourself 
sick about something you are afraid of and when you
" get to the dentist, you find he’s "
138
got the flu and cancelled your appointment.  What a
 waste of time that is.  So it’s just 
"wise, it’s common sense, especially in the time of "
"meditation, to forget about all the "
past and the future and to be free in the present m
oment. 
We have a skilful means in the Thai Forest traditio
n that comes from the time of the 
"Buddha, of using what we call ‘mindfulness’.  To ex"
"plain mindfulness, I use the "
"simile of a gatekeeper, who can be like the guard a"
t your house.  Some rich people 
have these guards to make sure that burglars do not
 get in and steal their goods.  And 
they know that mindfulness is much more than bare a
"ttention, because if you tell that "
"gatekeeper to just be mindful, be aware, just watch"
" what’s going on, you can imagine "
"what happens.  When you go home from the temple, yo"
u find that people have 
"burgled your house.  You ask the guard, “Weren’t yo"
u mindful?  I told you to guard 
"this house.”  And the guard says, “Yes, I was mindf"
ul.  I saw the burglars going in and 
I saw them going out with your stereo.  I watched t
hem go in again and take all your 
jewels.  I was very mindful.  I was fully aware all
 the time.”  Would you be very 
happy 
with 
that 
guard? 
Of 
course 
you 
wouldn’t. 
Re
member 
that 
this 
guard 
‘mindfulness’ has a job to do and that job is to ab
"andon, to let go of certain things.  "
You have to tell that guard very clearly that you w
ant to let go of the past and the 
"future, so that you can dwell in the present moment"
".  When you tell your guard that, "
the mind can do it quite easily as you go deeper in
to the present moment and become 
accustomed to the happiness and freedom of just bei
ng in the now. 
In the next stage of the meditation you will find t
hat you can’t even think.   I’m not 
sure if any of you like music.  But if you are list
ening to a beautiful piece of classical 
"music, in a great theatre or concert hall, do you e"
ver turn around to the person next to 
"you and start talking, saying what a wonderful piec"
e of music it is?  If you did you’d 
"get thrown out, and for good reason because as soon"
 as you start talking it means you 
are no longer listening.  It’s the same with your m
"ind, when you think of something, "
"or label something, it means you’re no longer liste"
ning.  It’s like being a host at a 
"party, your job is just to greet the visitors when "
"they come in, not to linger in "
conversation.  Because if you have a conversation w
ith one guest it means you are not 
paying attention to the guest who is coming right b
ehind.  The stream of the present 
"moment, if it is attended to fully, gives no time f"
or thought or for inner conversation.  
In that silence there is a deepening of what I call
 contentment.  It’s just like two old 
139
people who have been living together for so many ye
ars; they know each other so 
"well, they’re so at ease in each other’s company, t"
hat there’s no need to talk.  In the 
"same way, when you are fully at ease with the prese"
"nt moment, there is no need to say "
anything. 
All thinking is a sign of discontent; all thinking 
is a sign of wanting to escape to 
somewhere else.  So much of thinking is “what shoul
d I do next?”  When contentment 
arises in the mind such thoughts cannot arise.  In 
the meditation that I teach I always 
ask people to recognise the happiness of the presen
t moment and also the happiness of 
silence; each of those is very beautiful.  Once you
 realise the happiness of those states 
"there’s no need to make any effort to meditate, the"
re’s no need to try.  The mind by 
itself will always incline to where it finds happin
ess.  This is one of the beautiful 
teachings of the Buddha found in the 
"suttas"
.  Once that happiness is perceived you do 
not even need to think or make a resolution or deci
"sion, “may I go deeper into "
samadhi
" or stillness”, because these things happen all by "
themselves. 
In these stages of meditation it’s not a case of go
"ing on to something else, it’s a case "
of going deeper into this present moment.  You go d
"eeper into where you are, as you "
go into the silence of the mind and start to notice
" the happiness of silently being, "
without needing to say anything at all.  When that 
happiness is acknowledged you 
find that you cannot speak in the same way.  You ca
n be watching a movie on the 
television and you don’t say anything to anybody be
cause you are enjoying every 
moment of what is happening.  Here you are watching
 beautiful peaceful silence.  In 
the path of meditation there has to be a deepening 
of the silence of the present 
"moment.  It’s a deepening from diversity to unity, "
in the same present moment 
awareness.  In silence the mind can still go out to
" many things:  to the body, sounds, "
all sorts of different objects.  In 
jhana
 meditation there is the focussing of the mind on 
"just the one chosen object, with that silent awaren"
ess just focussing on one thing.  One 
is now letting go of the diversity of the mind – wh
at you might call the duality of the 
"mind, or the movement of the mind from one thing to"
 another.  This will often happen 
quite naturally.  In the silence there will always 
be one thing that appears to be 
beautiful and happy. 
140
I was taught to choose to watch the breath.  We wat
"ch the breath without controlling, "
"just being a silent observer, telling that gatekeep"
er to just stay with the breath as it 
goes in and out.  As you get closer to the breath y
ou don’t even know if it’s going in 
"or going out, you just know this breath that is hap"
pening now.  This is like a carpenter 
"who is sawing a piece of wood, focussing closer and"
 closer on the point where the saw 
meets the wood.  He cannot tell whether he’s focuss
ing on the beginning or the end of 
the saw.  All you know is this part of breath is ha
ppening now.  Sometimes people 
who try breath meditation have great difficulty bec
ause of controlling.  It is especially 
at this stage of the meditation that one has to let
 go of something that is very deep 
"inside of us, the ‘will’.  When we try and do this "
we often see how much we are trying 
"to control and manipulate, and this is what always "
messes up our meditation.  This is a 
cause for 
samadhi
 headaches. 
"Knowing that there’s a problem, analysing and seein"
"g what the difficulty is, there is "
always a way of overcoming it.  In meditation as in
" other parts of life, if we know the "
"problem, we can always avoid it.  I give people the"
 simile of the snakes – it’s my own 
simile drawn from the time when I was living in Aja
hn Chah’s monastery in Thailand.  
These were jungle monasteries and in those jungles 
there were many snakes.  You’d 
see far more snakes in Thailand in just one day tha
n I’ve seen in years in Australia.  
The place was crawling with snakes.  When I first w
ent there I was told that there are 
"one hundred species of snake in Thailand, ninety-ni"
ne of them are poisonous and the 
other one crushes you to death.  So they are all ve
ry dangerous.  There was no 
"electricity, sometimes we didn’t have batteries for"
" our flashlights, and sometimes we "
didn’t even have sandals.  It was a very poor monas
tery.  After the evening meditation 
we had to walk from the hall in the darkness using 
the stars or moonlight to light the 
"way through the jungle back to our huts, which were"
 sometimes five hundred metres 
away.  Because I knew there were snakes about I was
 always on the lookout for them 
"and, because I was on the lookout for them, because"
" I was mindful of the danger, I "
could always see them in plenty of time.  I would s
tep around them or jump over 
"them, "
but 
I 
never 
stepped 
on 
them. 
"Actually, "
once 
I 
nearly 
stepped 
on 
one; 
fortunately the snake jumped one way and I jumped t
he other way.  We were both 
very happy that we didn’t choose the same direction
.  I never stepped on one because 
I was always looking out for them. 
141
"In the same way, whatever problems and difficulties"
" you have in your meditation, if "
you really appreciate that it’s a problem and you k
"now it’s a danger, then you will "
look upon it like a snake.  That means you will be 
able to see it in good time before it 
can bite you.  And this is how we can avoid the pro
blems in our meditation.  Whether 
"it’s sleepiness, too much thinking, or whether it’s"
 the mind wandering from one thing 
"to another, know your snake and then you’ll be able"
 to take evasive action before it 
"really gets a hold of you.  The thinking mind, once"
" it gets hold of you, is hard to stop.  "
"Anger, once it grabs hold of you, bites and bites, "
"you cannot get it off.  If you avoid it, "
then you are free. 
"On this path of meditation, concentrating on the br"
eath or concentrating on any one 
"thing, is just a way of overcoming problems by keep"
ing the sense activities still.  At 
least you are letting go of most of the five senses
.  By just watching one thing all the 
other senses disappear:  you can neither hear nor f
"eel the rest of the body, and smell "
and taste have already gone.  This letting go of th
e five senses is very profound 
because they define our mind and body.  If we medit
ate very deeply we won’t be able 
to hear anything of the sounds outside.  In the sam
"e way, just giving a simile from "
"ordinary life, when you watch the television someti"
mes you can’t hear your partner 
"saying dinner is ready, or you can’t hear the telep"
"hone.  Two of my disciples, I’m "
"embarrassed to say, were watching the television on"
e evening in their house and when 
the program finished they looked around and noticed
 that a few things were missing 
from the room.  A burglar had been into their house
", came right into the room where "
"they were watching the T.V., and stole things from "
right behind them.  They had been 
so engrossed in the movie they hadn’t even heard th
is very cheeky burglar. 
"I don’t encourage that!  But in meditation, if it h"
"appens, you are getting somewhere.  "
What it means is that you have been able to let go 
of concern for the world outside 
and you are getting closer and closer to what we ca
"ll the mind.  As you all know, in "
Buddhism there are six senses.  The five external s
enses dominate the consciousness 
so much that it’s like an Emperor with knee high bo
"ots, trousers, a big jacket, a hat on, "
and a scarf around his head so you can’t see anythi
ng of him.  All you can see are the 
garments covering the Emperor from head to toe.  In
" that simile, the Emperor stands "
"for the mind, the hat is sight, the scarf sound, th"
"e jacket smell, the trousers taste, and "
"the boots touch, completely covering that which we "
call the mind. 
142
From Diversity to Unity 
Meditation is letting go of all that.  We are letti
ng go of the five senses by choosing 
"just one part of one sense base, just the breath, o"
r something else.  After a while 
"everything disappears, until even the perception of"
 the breath disappears.  In other 
words it is the happiness of just being with one si
mple little thing.  Eventually that 
happiness becomes so strong that the mind becomes a
ware of the happiness of the 
breath 
disappearing. 
Once 
the 
body 
or 
the 
five 
sen
ses 
"disappear, "
in 
traditional 
"Buddhism, in the way of my teachers, and in the way"
" of experience, what happens "
next is that a beautiful light appears in the mind.
  In our tradition we call this a 
nimitta
. 
This 
nimitta
 is no more than the sign of your mind when the oth
er five senses 
disappear.  The Buddha gave a very wonderful simile
; he said it’s the same as on a 
cloudy night when the clouds part and the disc of t
"he full moon appears – bright, "
"brilliant, and clear – in the sky.  This is a simil"
e of what happens when the five senses 
disappear.  What you are seeing is a reflection of 
your own mind.  I always tell 
meditators to understand that what you are seeing i
"s not something through the eye, it "
is not a vision; this is a 
mental object
.  This is the mind being a beautiful mirror and 
"seeing itself.  And at this time in the meditation,"
" when these beautiful lights appear, "
you have to be very still because it’s like looking
 at your own face in the mirror.  If 
you move then so does the image in the mirror.  If 
you try and hold the mirror still it 
"doesn’t make any difference, "
you have to be still
".  The observer has to be so still, so "
motionless that what is being observed is also moti
onless.  The degree of peacefulness 
is measured by the stillness one experiences in the
se states.  The degree of inner 
"energy is born of stillness, born of contentment, a"
nd is the measure of the happiness.  
The brilliance of what one experiences is the happi
ness – and that becomes quite 
immense at this stage – but it’s not a happiness of
" the five senses.  On the contrary, "
it’s the happiness of the mind released from that w
orld; it’s happiness born of letting 
go. 
"As an interesting aside, many of you may have heard"
 of people who have had ‘out of 
"the body experiences’, people who have died tempora"
rily and come back to tell the 
tale.  Have you ever heard of people dying?  First 
of all they float out of their body 
143
and then they seem to be going towards the light.  
What you experience when you die 
is no more than the five senses stopping and the mi
nd manifesting itself. 
That mind being manifest is no more than the light 
that people see when they die.  
That’s why this meditation is almost like training 
for dying and getting to know what 
it’s like when the five senses stop and disappear. 
 If you can manage to merge into the 
"light, that is called "
jhana
 in 
(#
 Buddhism.  It’s called a 
jhana
 because it’s a 
"fullness of the meditation, a time when you’ve comp"
letely merged with the mind and 
the five senses are completely gone.  In our tradit
ion it’s the first real experience of 
non-duality; it’s non-duality because there are not
" two any more, there is no separate "
"observer, the mind is unified.  It is the first rea"
l experience of what they call 
samadhi
", "
that centring or unification just on the one sense 
of mind.  And it’s very blissful.  But 
it’s not that one gains these states just for the s
ake of bliss; it’s also for the sake of 
what these states mean. 
These aren’t stages of attachment; they are stages 
of letting go.  They arise because 
you’ve let go of a great burden.  One of the discip
les here in Perth – I like telling this 
story because it’s a fascinating story – managed to
 get into one of these states of 
meditation.  He just fluked it by chance.  He was d
oing meditation in the bedroom of 
his house.  After a couple of hours his wife checke
d up on him because he usually 
only meditated for forty-five minutes or an hour.  
When she went into the room she 
"saw her husband, a middle aged Australian, sitting "
so still she couldn’t even see his 
chest moving.  She put a mirror under his nose and 
she could see no sign of breath; so 
she panicked and called the ambulance.  The ambulan
ce came from Sir Charles 
Gairdner Hospital and the medics stormed into the b
edroom where he was sitting 
meditation.  They took his pulse; there was no puls
e at all.  So they put him onto the 
stretcher and into the back of the ambulance and we
nt screaming off with all the 
sirens going to the hospital.  They got him into th
e emergency room and put all the 
machines on him and they could see from the machine
s that he had no heart beat and 
no brain waves; he was brain dead!  But the interes
ting thing is that the person who 
was looking after the emergency room that evening w
as an Indian doctor.  He was an 
"Australian, but his parents were from India, and he"
 had heard his parents talking about 
people who go into deep meditation in India.  When 
he heard that was what this man 
had been doing he noticed a strange thing:  the upp
er half of his body was still warm; 
144
usually if someone is dead they would be cold all o
ver.  So he decided to give him 
"electric shocks, to try and start his heart up agai"
n.  They tried several times and 
nothing worked.  Then the man came naturally out of
" his meditation, sat up, and "
"asked, “How did I get here?”  Afterwards he said he"
 was just blissed out.  But the 
worst part of the experience was walking home with 
his wife because she gave him a 
scolding and made him promise her that he would nev
er do it again.  That was a 
shame because it was a wonderful experience to have
 and it showed just what’s 
possible with meditation. 
The happiness of that state should be understood.  
It is the happiness of letting go.  
Anyone who has experienced those states already kno
ws what will happen when they 
"die.  When the body disappears, you are left with t"
he mind.  When you experience 
these states you’re beginning to understand the cor
e of this thing that we call body and 
"mind.  You’ll never have any doubts about rebirth, "
nor will you have any fears about 
"death, if you understand the nature of the mind.  B"
"ut more than that, one understands "
"that by letting go of doing, manipulating, and crav"
ing you get these happy states. 
"Many people have had these states once, just by cha"
"nce, and have craved to get them "
"back again.  If you’ve had a religious experience, "
"a state of bliss, and crave to get it "
back again you never will.  The only way to experie
nce those states is by a very 
"profound letting go, a very, very profound non-doin"
"g, and a very profound emptiness "
"of the mind, a mind empty of the ‘doer’.  All these"
 things just happen by themselves.  
"They are beautiful processes, empty of a ‘controlle"
"r’, empty of a ‘doer’.  That is what "
you are learning to let go of in this beautiful med
"itation.  The more you control, the "
"more you press the buttons and flick the switches, "
the more problems you get. 
It can be very scary to get into deep meditations. 
 Do you know the reason why?  It’s 
because ‘you’ have to disappear before you get into
" them.  You’re letting go of you, "
or what you take to be you.  That’s why it’s wonder
ful to be able to completely get rid 
of the person in here who is always calling the sho
"ts, always talking, always making "
the decisions.  Just allow things to stop by themse
lves.  Once in our monastery in 
"Thailand, there was a young novice who was listenin"
g to a talk by our teacher Ajahn 
Chah.  Ajahn Chah would go on and on and on for man
y hours – I promise I won’t go 
on for much longer!  He would go on and on and on a
nd this little novice was 
145
"thinking, ‘When is he going to stop?’  ‘When is he "
going to stop?’  Hour after hour 
"this little novice kept on thinking, ‘When is Ajahn"
 Chah going to stop?’ and then the 
novice had what we call an insight.  Instead of thi
"nking, ‘When is Ajahn Chah going "
"to stop?’ he thought, ‘When will I stop?’  And he s"
topped.  When he came out of his 
meditation many hours later the hall was empty.  Aj
ahn Chah had gone to his hut and 
he was just sitting there happy and blissed out.  H
e had stopped.  Isn’t it wonderful to 
stop? 
Every time we come up to a red traffic light it’s t
eaching us Buddhism.  Stop!  Do you 
know that in Delhi the traffic lights don’t have S.
T.O.P. written on the red light; 
instead they have R.E.L.A.X.!  So when people come 
to a traffic light in Delhi instead 
of getting tight and tense they see this beautiful 
word ‘relax’.  That’s what meditation 
is all about:  in that stopping is happiness.  The 
"more you stop, the more happiness "
you 
have 
and 
this 
is 
the 
reason 
meditation 
gives 
yo
u 
that 
inner 
"joy, "
that 
inner 
happiness.  By stopping you energise the mind.  You
 energise the body by exercising 
"it, but you energise the mind by stopping it and ca"
lming it. 
"Once you can get into very deep meditation, if you "
"want to, you can even remember "
your past lives.  All you need to do is ask yoursel
"f, what is your earliest memory?  "
The mind that has a deep experience of stillness co
"mes out of that stillness so clear, so "
"powerful, and so well trained, that memories of you"
"r past come up very clearly, even "
memories of the time when you were born.  Some peop
le think that when you are 
born you’ve got no consciousness.  I’ve been collec
ting stories of babies who speak.  I 
have heard of two cases already in Perth.  One of t
"he cases was from two Australians, "
"Westerners, who came to the monastery one day.  The"
"y had two children, one was a "
three week old baby and one was about two and a hal
f years old.  One baby was 
named Peter and the other was called Richard.  It w
as time for the elder boy Peter to 
go to bed and the mother and father sent him up to 
"his room.  Before he went to bed, "
he went to the pram leaned over and said to his bab
"y brother, “Good night Richard”, "
"and little Richard said, “Good night Peter”.  They "
were spooked; they couldn’t believe 
what they had heard.  They stopped reading their ma
gazines and turned around in 
disbelief looking at the pram.  The elder boy said 
"once more, “Good night Richard” "
"and this time with both parents watching, fully min"
"dful, little Richard three weeks old "
"said, “Good night Peter”, and both the parents hear"
d it very clearly. 
146
There are other cases like that.  One case I’ve hea
rd of was in Malaysia.  It was in a 
newspaper article so I don’t know if it is true or 
"not, but it deserves to be true.  In a "
"maternity ward in the United States, in front of th"
"e doctor, the midwife, and the "
"nurses, when this little baby came out of the womb,"
" it spoke in clear English, saying, "
"“Oh no, not again!” "
You were actually conscious at the time of your bir
th.  And you can remember your 
past lives.  What a wonderful thing to actually sho
w that Buddhism is true and that 
meditation works.  But please make sure that you do
"n’t come out again and say, “Oh "
"no, not again!”  Please let go of this world. "
Conclusion 
"So, in our tradition that’s what we call the "
jhana
" meditations, and you can experience "
those 
jhana
meditations 
deeply 
and 
powerfully. 
One 
of 
the 
thi
ngs 
about 
jhana
"meditations is that you can’t think, you can’t hear"
", you are completely non-dual, one "
pointed.  There are many different 
jhanas
", each of a different level, each level with "
"more refined bliss.  As you let go, not only are yo"
u knowing the nature of the mind 
but you’re letting go of that mind and with full le
tting go everything disappears.  
That’s what we mean by the bliss of 
!!
.
!!
 in our tradition is indicated by 
a flame going out.  That was the usual word used wh
en a candle or oil light flickered 
and completely went out.  It was said the flame had
!!
-ed. 
"Some of you ask, “Where is "
!!
", where do you go after you get "
!!
-ed?”  
"The answer is another question, ‘where does the fla"
"me go?’  Does it go to the North, "
"the South, the East, or the West?  The answer is no"
", the flame was always empty, it "
"just depended on heat, the wick, and the wax.  When"
 those conditions end so does the 
"flame.  And the conditions that keep you going, whe"
"n they disappear, then so do you.  "
Like a beautiful meteorite going around this solar 
"system for thousands, millions, or "
"billions of years, one day it finally reaches the e"
nd.  It burns in a beautiful light which 
you see as a shooting star and then it’s gone.  The
 beautiful light which you see as a 
shooting star is gone forever.  It’s just like a pe
rson roaming around 

", life after "
"life after life, until eventually they meet the "
Dhamma
 of the Buddha and go out in a 
147
beautiful blaze of light.  They illuminate the 
Dhamma
" for so many people, and then "
they’re gone.

10  CONDITIONED REALITY 
Dhammaloka Buddhist Centre 
7
th
 July 2000 
Subjects that often come up in Buddhism are the con
"ditioned and unconditioned, "
"especially if one is a seeker after the truth, a se"
"eker after reality, a seeker after "
"freedom.  People who have studied basic psychology,"
 or have some understanding of 
"the nature of things, know how much we are conditio"
ned by our 
kamma
","
 by our 
"experiences, and by so many different things.  Thos"
e conditions actually affect the 
way we see the world and experience reality.  They 
also affect our choices and the 
"way we use our life.  When we look very deeply, we "
can see that our choices 
"condition our lives, but our choices are not free. "
 There are many influences making 
us do the things that we do.  The way we look at th
ings is not as ‘they truly are’.  
"Many people have pointed out that we see, we hear, "
and we experience what we want 
to experience and what we want to see.  This is the
 reason that our reality differs from 
the reality of the person sitting next to us. 
The Cycle of Delusion 
"We create and make our own reality, our own world. "
 We live in that world.  We 
condition that world.  I spoke very briefly earlier
" about the Buddhist idea of a God, "
especially about creation and whether Buddhists bel
"ieve in a ‘big bang’, or in the "
beginning of things.  The person who asked me that 
question very accurately pointed 
out that the one thing that we can know is that the
re is a creator inside of us.  We 
create our world.  We might say we condition our wo
rld.  The way we condition our 
world is very much due to outside influences.  Peop
le wish to be free and we talk a lot 
"about freedom in this Western world, but if we look"
" deeper, we find that what we take "
to be freedom is bound by the chains of conditionin
g.  The goal of Buddhism is to see 
"that conditioning, recognise it and untie those bon"
ds. 
In Buddhism we have a teaching called the Ten Fette
rs.  Fetter is a very accurate 
translation of the 
Pali
 word 

.  Using the ideas of the agrarian society of 
"India 2,500 ago, "

 means the wooden neckpiece for coupling a pair of 
draught 
oxen.  This was how one joined the oxen together to
" pull a cart.  This is a fetter, a "
149
binding.  The whole idea of Buddhism is to recognis
e that you are bound and then to 
untie that binding to achieve a type of freedom tha
"t is not recognised in this world, the "
freedom of the Enlightened person. 
People sometimes think that monks are just attached
 to rules:  attached to being 
"celibate, attached to having few things, and attach"
ed to being happy.  They don’t 
realise that this is all about freedom from bonds a
nd freedom from conditioning.  
People don’t realise what these conditionings reall
y are.  We have blind spots and yet 
we think that we are freethinkers.  We think that w
e are being rational and scientific.  
Having 
worked 
in 
science 
as 
a 
theoretical 
physicist
at 
Cambridge 
"University, "
I 
realised even then that many scientists are not fre
ethinkers.  They are conditioned.  
"Much of what they do is laden with many, many value"
"s, and very often they find what "
"they are looking for, rather than what is really th"
ere. 
"I read an article in a newspaper, about a debate on"
 whether science or ‘the scientific 
method’ 
is 
"value free, in "
other 
"words, "
whether 
it’s
subjective. 
The 
debate 
was 
regarding genetically engineered food.  The scienti
"sts said they were being rational, "
that there is nothing wrong with genetic engineerin
g.  Other people were saying that 
there is a lot wrong with it.  Who is right and who
 is wrong?  The scientists said the 
other people were being completely irrational and w
ere just seeing things through 
their own belief systems.  Because scientists have 
"no belief systems, they see things as "
they truly are!  The argument was settled for many 
scientists and philosophers.  But 
who says that science is value free?  There are so 
many conditionings in science that 
you see just what you want to see.  So much so that
 there is an old saying in science: 
‘The eminence of a great scientist is measured by 
the 
length of time they obstruct progress in their fie
ld.’ 
The more famous the scientist and the more prominen
"t they are, the more their views "
are taken to be gospel truth.  That means a great s
cientist is so great that he or she 
can’t be wrong.  So they actually obstruct progress
 for many years because they must 
be right and everyone sees it from that standpoint.
150
The Buddha very clearly outlined the whole process 
of conditioning.  He explained 
that we see the world through tinted glasses.  He e
xplained that what we take to be 
"truth, to be real, is far from reality.  He called "
the whole process of conditioning and 
"brainwashing, coming mostly from within us, "
  
.  They are the perverted 
aspect of the whole process of conditioning.  They’
re the reason that what we think 
we know turns out to be wrong.  Have you ever been 
absolutely sure you were right 
and then found out you were wrong?  It happens all 
the time.  The 
  
", these "
"perversions of the conditioning process, work in a "
"circle, a cycle of delusion.  Our "
"views – what we understand as truth, as reality – i"
nfluence our perceptions.  Basically 
"our views influence what we choose to see, to hear,"
 and experience.  Out of all the 
different impressions that life offers us there are
 many things that you could be aware 
of right now.  You could be aware of what I am sayi
ng.  You could be just aware of 
what I look like.  You could be aware of some fanta
sies being played out in your 
mind.  Why do you choose to be aware of one thing a
nd not the other?  It’s because 
your views guide your choice. 
"If you are angry at someone, or if you have ill wil"
"l towards them, you will always find "
something in them to justify that ill will.  They s
"ay, “Please, have a nice day today”, "
and you think “what on earth do they mean by that?”
  It is the same with paranoia.  If 
"someone is really paranoid, they may think a monk i"
s reading their mind.  The monk 
"says, “No I’m not,” and they say, “I knew you were "
going to say that.”  A psychiatrist 
told me a few days ago that you can only increase p
"aranoia, you can’t decrease it.  "
Whatever you say is looked upon by that person as c
onfirming their view.  If you are 
in love with somebody it doesn’t matter what they d
"o or say.  If they pick their nose, "
"they pick it in such a charming way.  You think, “I"
 just love the way you do that”. 
Perception is completely controlled by your views. 
 I’m going to read a story just to 
show 
this. 
This 
story 
is 
called 
‘Harvard’s 
Loss’. 
“The 
President 
of 
Harvard 
University made a mistake by prejudging people and 
it cost him dearly.  A lady in a 
faded gingham dress (gingham is just plain woven st
riped or checked cotton cloth) 
"and her husband, in a homespun threadbare suit, ste"
"pped off the train in Boston, "
Massachusetts 
and 
walked 
timidly 
without 
an 
appoint
ment 
into 
the 
University 
President’s outer office.  The secretary frowned.  
She could tell in a moment that such 
151
backwoods country hicks had no business at Harvard 
University and probably didn’t 
even deserve to be in Cambridge.  “We want to see t
he President” the man said softly.  
“He’ll be busy all day” the secretary snapped.  “We
"’ll wait”, the lady replied. "
The secretary ignored them for hours hoping that th
e couple would finally become 
"discouraged and go away, but they didn’t.  The secr"
etary grew frustrated and finally 
"decided to disturb the President, even though it wa"
s a chore she always regretted 
doing.  “Maybe if they just see you for a few minut
"es they’ll leave”, she told the "
President of Harvard University.  He sighed in exas
peration and nodded.  Someone of 
his importance obviously did not have the time to s
"pend with them, but he detested "
gingham dresses and home spun suits cluttering up h
"is outer office.  The President, "
"stern faced with dignity, strutted towards the coup"
"le.  The lady told him, “We had a "
son who attended Harvard for one year.  He loved Ha
rvard and he was happy here but 
"about a year ago he was accidentally killed.  So, m"
y husband and I would like to erect 
"a memorial to him, somewhere on the campus.  The Pr"
"esident wasn’t touched, he was "
"shocked.   “Madam”, he said gruffly, “we can’t put "
up a statue to every person who 
"attended Harvard and died, if we did the place woul"
"d look like a cemetery.”  “Oh no”, "
"the lady explained quickly, “We don’t want to erect"
 a statue.  We thought we would 
like to give a building to Harvard.”  The president
 rolled his eyes.  He glanced at the 
"gingham dress and the homespun suit and exclaimed, "
“A building!  Do you have any 
idea how much a building costs?  (This was many yea
rs ago.)  We have over seven 
and a half million dollars in plant at Harvard.”  F
or a moment the lady was silent.  The 
"President was pleased, he could get rid of them now"
.  The lady turned to her husband 
"and said quietly, “if that is all it costs to start"
" a university, why don’t we just start our "
"own,” "
and 
her 
husband 
nodded. 
The 
president’s 
face
wilted 
in 
confusion 
and 
bewilderment.  Mr and Mrs Leyland Stanford walked a
"way, travelled to Palo Alto, "
"California, where they established a university kno"
wn as Stanford University that 
bears their name.  It was a memorial to a son that 
Harvard no longer cared about.” 
Isn’t that a lovely story?  Just because those two 
people wore ordinary dress no one 
realised that they were millionaires and so they st
arted their own university.  Isn’t that 
so often the case in life? 
What we are looking for is what we see.  That’s the
 reason the Buddha taught that 
152
even your bare perception is already conditioned.  
Even what you hear – or rather 
"what you choose to hear – what you choose to see, c"
"hoose to feel, has already been "
"filtered by your conditioning, by your attachments,"
 by your desires and cravings.  
"That’s why even teaching of Krishnamurti, a sort of"
" silent awareness, or non-doing "
was not good enough to find the real truth.  What y
ou see and hear is never reliable.  
"That’s the reason why sometimes, when I give talks,"
" I give one message, but what you "
hear may be very different from the message.  Somet
hing happens to the words that I 
say before they go into your consciousness.  Some t
hings get filtered out!  Has it ever 
happened 
to 
you? 
Have 
you 
ever 
said 
something 
and 
it’s 
been 
completely 
"misunderstood?  You say, “I didn’t say that”, and t"
"he other person says, “Yes you "
"did”.  You may have said many things, but they’ve b"
een filtered out or taken out of 
context.  That’s where misunderstandings come from.
  When you begin to understand 
"the way that this cognitive process works, you can "
understand how we condition even 
our bare perceptions. 
From those perceptions we build up our thoughts.  T
his bare knowledge that comes to 
"the mind as you feel, as you see, builds up our tho"
ughts.  And those thoughts in turn 
confirm our views.  We have this circle of views be
nding our perceptions to suit their 
"purpose, and those perceptions, again bending the t"
houghts to confirm the views.  
"That’s the reason we have different ideas, philosop"
"hies, and religions in this world.  "
One of those religions is science.  Another can be 
"psychology, and others can be "
"humanism, irrationalism, agnosticism, or even Buddh"
ism.  These are all different 
views and ideas in the world.  What really concerne
d me when I was young was 
where these views and ideas came from.  Why do rati
onal people believe in a God 
who created this world and at the same time created
 the Devil just to tease people?  
That was very difficult for me to understand.  Othe
"r points of view, for example, the "
"idea of conditioning shaped by our existing views, "
"thoughts, and perceptions, made it "
very clear how this was happening.  What we receive
 from the world is basically 
conditioned by what we expect to receive. 
In Denial
I am going to read a poem now.  Listen to this poem
.  It’s about the love for a mother 
and everyone knows that that’s a wonderful thing. 
153
‘When your mother has grown older and you have gro
"wn older, "
When what was formally easy and effortless becomes
" a burden, "
When her dear loyal eyes do not look out into life
" as before, "
When her legs have grown tired and do not want to 
"carry her any more, "
"Then give her your arm for support, accompany her "
"with gladness and joy, "
"The hour will come, weeping, when you accompany he"
r on her last journey; 
"And if she asks you always answer her, and if she "
asks again speak also 
And if she asks another time speak to her not stor
"mily but in gentle peace, "
And if she cannot understand you well explain ever
"ything joyfully, "
"Because the hour will come, the bitter hour, when h"
er mouth will ask no 
more.’ 
That’s a 
poem 
that 
was 
translated from 
"German, "
writ
ten 
by 
a 
very 
well 
known 
German called Adolf Hitler in 1923.  Did you know t
hat Adolf Hitler was a poet and 
that he loved his mother very dearly and thought ab
out his love for his mother?  No!  
"Well, isn’t that because our views are that such a "
man is so bad and evil that we can 
never even entertain the idea that he could have a 
soft emotional loving side? 
How many of you can make ‘Adolf Hitler’s’ out of yo
ur ex-husbands or your ex-
wives?  Do you understand what I am saying?  The co
nditioning process means that if 
we think somebody is an enemy then we think they’re
 rotten.  We think they’re bad 
"and that’s all we see.  We can even think, ‘I am ro"
"tten’, ‘I am bad’, ‘I am awful’, and "
that’s 
what 
we’ll 
see. 
The 
conditioning 
process 
is
so 
strong 
that 
people 
can 
sometimes get so depressed with themselves that the
y commit suicide.  Or they can 
get so full of themselves that they become egocentr
ic and don’t listen to anyone else.  
This is all just conditioning working in these thre
e ways.  Don’t think that you are free 
from that.  Even now you are not hearing what I am 
"saying but what you want to hear, "
what you expect to hear.  This is the difficulty fo
"r human beings, being able to know "
the truth of things. 
Another example is rebirth or reincarnation.  It’s 
a fascinating subject:  not whether 
"it’s true or false, but why people believe it’s tru"
e or false.  That’s something that has 
fascinated me for many years.  Why is it that when 
someone has a memory of a 
"rebirth and they clearly remember it, other people "
"often say, “No, it cannot be that "
154
"way, there has to be some other explanation”?  Or, "
why is it that when something 
"happens to you, you believe it has to be due to som"
e event in a previous birth?  Why 
are there such strong views on either side?  I am e
specially interested in the reason 
people refuse to believe in rebirth.  As a scientis
"t, as a rational person, at the very least "
you should have an open mind.  To me it was somethi
"ng that was quite obvious, "
something that I grew up with.  My parents weren’t 
Buddhists but rebirth always 
seemed such an obvious thing to me.  I don’t know w
"here I got that idea from, but "
there it was.  I found when I came to Western count
"ries like Australia, or when I go to "
"see my family in England, that there is a great res"
istance to the very idea of rebirth.  It 
wasn’t that people had open minds; rather they had 
"very closed minds, a locked door "
"to the idea.  When I looked deeply, I saw clearly t"
hat people had a very strong 
antagonism to the idea of rebirth.  The main reason
 people are afraid of rebirth is 
because they don’t want to be reborn.  They just wa
nt to have this life and that’s the 
end.  That is one of the reasons people will not ev
en entertain strong hard evidence 
that they have lived before and that they are going
 to live again. 
"Whether it’s Buddhism, Christianity, or Hinduism, o"
"r whatever, rebirth leads to a new "
"life.  No matter what religion or belief you have, "
the next life is always dependent on 
what you’ve done in this life.  Basically most peop
le are so ill behaved that they are 
scared of what’s going to happen to them in their n
ext life.  They would rather believe 
that there is not going to be a next life.  They ar
e in denial!  Where does that denial 
"come from?  Again, it’s the conditioning and brain "
"washing, “I don’t want to believe "
it’s true.  I don’t want to see this and therefore 
I don’t see it”. 
Another example is from a disciple of mine.  Many y
ears ago she had a very big 
problem because her husband was sexually abusing he
r children.  He went to jail.  She 
couldn’t see what was happening for many months.  S
he was a very loving mother 
and a very loving wife.  As sometimes happens in th
"ose terrible situations, it came out "
at school.  The teachers saw the signs and when the
y investigated they found that they 
"had assessed the situation correctly, the children "
where being abused.  The mother felt 
"very guilty, but why was it that she couldn’t see t"
hose signs?  As a Buddhist monk – 
"who knows about the mind, knows about conditioning,"
 knows about the psychology 
of all this – I had to explain to her the reason sh
e could not see what others could see.  
The situation was so horrendous that subconsciously
 she didn’t want to see it.  If you 
155
don’t want to see something you just cannot see it.
"  It’s not a matter of suppression, "
which is done openly.  It’s blocked out at a subcon
scious level.  It happens before this 
process comes to the mind’s consciousness.  It’s al
ready been filtered out. 
There was a very interesting experiment done a few 
years ago at Harvard University.  
In front of some volunteer students psychologists f
lashed images on a screen and 
asked the students to write down what they thought 
the image represented.  The image 
was flashed so quickly that at first they could not
 really make out what the image was.  
Gradually the length of the exposure was increased 
until they could record some idea 
of what it was.  Then the time on the screen was fu
rther increased so that the students 
could record whether it was what they had expected 
"it to be, until the time the "
exposure was long enough for them to clearly tell w
hat it was. 
The findings are illustrated with one example.  The
 actual photograph was of a very 
"well known part of the campus, a set of steps going"
 up to one of the faculty buildings.  
There was a bicycle by the side of the steps.  One 
"student saw it as a ship at sea, but "
because 
the 
image 
was 
flashed 
so 
quickly 
it 
wasn’t 
much 
more 
than 
a 
guess.  
"However, once that idea was in his mind, when the l"
ength of exposure on the screen 
"was increased incrementally, he still saw it as a s"
"hip at sea, again and again.  He saw it "
as a ship when every one else could see it as a wel
l know part of the campus.  He 
insisted it was a ship at sea until the exposure wa
s so long that he eventually saw his 
mistake and corrected it.  The lesson from that was
 that once you form a view it 
interferes so greatly with your perception that eve
n though the image is right in front 
"of you, you cannot see it.  You see it in a differe"
nt way than it truly is. 
One of the images that were during the experiment t
ook the students a particularly 
long time to figure out; it was a picture of two do
gs copulating.  It was such an 
obscene or unpleasant thing to see that the student
"s were in complete denial, again and "
"again and again, until it was so obvious that they "
had to see it for what it was.  This is 
solid 
evidence 
for 
what 
the 
Buddha 
said 
about 
the 
p
erversions 
of 
our 
cognitive 
processes.  Even though we think we know what our p
"artner is saying to us, even "
"though we think we know who they are, how often we "
are wrong.  This is so not just 
"in relationships with others, but also in our relat"
ionship with ourselves. 
156
Seeing Truth and Reality 
I want particularly to mention the relationship to 
truth.  Is Buddhism just another 
"conditioned belief like everything else, with no gr"
eater validity than science or any 
other religion?  Is there no truth?  Is it all rela
tive according to our conditioning?  In 
"other words, how can we break through a conditioned"
 way of seeing and perceiving?  
"Remember, the whole reason we bend our perceptions,"
" thoughts, and views is because "
of wanting.  We see and we hear what we want to see
" and hear, and we deny what we "
"don’t want to see, hear, or feel.  It’s the wanting"
 that is the problem.  It is wanting that 
conditions us away from truth. 
The Buddha became Enlightened by giving up all want
ing.  Instead of wanting to see 
"the universe in any particular way, or wanting to s"
"ee himself in any particular way, he "
"overcame all of that wanting, or craving.  That’s n"
ot a very easy thing to do.  It’s 
called ‘letting 
"go’, "
being still. 
The 
sign of crav
ing is movement.  The sign of 
attachment is not being able to let go.  The sign o
f ego is controlling.  That’s why we 
"come across those things in meditation:  craving, a"
"ttachments, and controlling, again "
and again.  These things stop us from seeing truth 
and reality.  We have to completely 
"let go of all desire and all craving, temporarily, "
in our meditation. 
Most of you have just meditated for half an hour.  
At the end of the meditation I told 
you to look at how you feel.  Consider what works a
nd what doesn’t work in your 
meditation.  This is an exercise in overcoming cond
itioning.  It’s truly brainwashing 
"your mind of all of its conditioning, all of its cr"
"avings, all of its wanting to see things "
this way or that way.  It is letting go of all of t
"hat, letting go of all your ideas, because "
they are the bricks and mortar of conditioning.  Ha
ve you noticed that when you face 
something you interpret it with your thoughts?  Whe
re did all those thoughts come 
from?  Why do you see it this way and not another w
ay?  The reason is your 
conditioning. 
"A few days ago, someone gave the monks some ginger "
beer in what looked like wine 
"bottles.  It looked like wine, but it wasn’t wine; "
"it wasn’t alcoholic, it was just ginger "
beer.  This led the monks to talk about alcohol and
 drinking.  The other monks related 
"experiences that I had also had in my youth, when I"
 first went to a public house in 
England to have my first glass of beer.  My first r
"eaction to drinking beer was, “This "
157
is disgusting stuff; how can anyone drink it?  Why 
do people spend so much money 
drinking 
this 
stuff?” 
That 
first 
perception 
was 
pr
obably 
true; 
bitter 
beer 
was 
disgusting.  But after a while I began to like it. 
 I wondered what had happened there.  
Why was it that when I first tasted the beer it was
" awful and then, when I was "
"eighteen or nineteen, I was drinking a lot of the s"
tuff?  I saw the reason was that it was 
socially 
accepted 
to 
drink 
"beer, "
and everyone 
else 
said 
it 
was 
delicious. 
I 
had 
reconditioned my senses to like it.  Because societ
"y said it was delicious, it became "
delicious.  I liked it because I wanted to like it.
  That’s all there was to it. 
I’ve seen that with modern art as well.  What is be
autiful in modern art?  Someone 
told me that there was an artist in France who mana
ged to talk a gallery into mounting 
his exhibition.  There where just empty picture fra
mes on the empty wall.  This was a 
statement; he sold thousands of dollars worth of pi
ctures.  Have you ever seen that 
happen in the world?  What was that which we just h
eard?  Was it a beautiful sound 
or was it an intrusive mobile phone?  Isn’t it your
 conditioning that causes you to see 
in a particular way?  If you know the mind is condi
"tioned, why not condition it in a "
wise way to create happiness?  If it’s a mobile pho
ne you have two choices.  You can 
"say, “That’s a very beautiful sound, it’s very musi"
"cal, not like the old phones, ‘ring, "
"ring, ring, ring’.  At least it’s got a bit of styl"
"e these days”.  Or you can say, “We "
shouldn’t have mobile phones in here.  Who did that
?  I’m going to talk to them 
afterwards.  We should excommunicate them from the 
Buddhist Society.  We are 
"never going to let them come in again”.  Now, which"
 response do you want to take?  
Can you see how we condition ourselves? 
Once we know how conditioning works we can conditio
n ourselves into forgiveness 
and happiness.  One of the first things we can do i
"s say, “Well, I’ve got a choice.  I "
can develop the positive conditioning or the negati
ve conditioning.  I can look at a 
person and see their good qualities or I can look i
nto them and see their bad qualities.  
Both are there”.  I have conditioned myself over th
e many years that I have been 
"monk, to see the good qualities in people, so much "
so that some people tell me off 
saying 
that 
I 
should 
be 
a 
bit 
more 
critical. 
But 
I
cannot 
do 
that 
now. 
The 
conditioning is too strong. 
People in the Monaster
"y, or the monks I live with, "
"sometimes do wrong things.  The other day, while I "
"was away, there was a bit of "
discussion and bad feeling about a decision to do w
ith the books in our monastery.  I 
158
talked with one of the people – who felt quite hurt
" afterwards – and I said, “Look, I "
can’t get hurt by any of the monks in this monaster
"y.  They are all such kind, good "
people. 
 We 
know that 
everyone 
is 
not 
Enlightened a
nd 
that 
we’ve all 
got 
bad 
qualities as well”.  I was being absolutely honest.
  I can't get angry at any of the 
"monks in the monastery, no matter what they do, bec"
ause I see too many good things 
about them.  Even people who come here to the Buddh
"ist Centre, no matter what you "
"do, "
you 
have 
so 
many 
good 
qualities 
in 
each 
one 
of 
you. 
That’s 
the 
way 
my 
conditioning works now.  When you perceive the good
 in a person it’s impossible to 
get angry or upset with them.  You are all my frien
ds and if I look at you that way it’s 
very hard to see anything else.  If you do somethin
"g to try and hurt me, I’d say, “No, "
"no, I remember all the good things you’ve done.” "
Why is it that if a person says something to upset 
"you, that’s all you remember?  You "
never remember all the kind things they’ve done for
" you, all the kind words they’ve "
said to you.  I’m the other way.  I forget all the 
rotten things people have said about 
me and only remember the kind things.  Which one is
 truer?  They are both equally 
wrong.  But I choose the one that is wrong and happ
y.  It’s interesting that this type of 
"conditioning – seeing the positive, seeing the happ"
"iness, the positive in yourself, the "
"happiness in life, the happiness in other people – "
is also the path that leads to de-
"conditioning and the unconditioned, to seeing thing"
s clearly. 
When you develop happiness in your life – getting r
id of negativity and ill will 
towards oneself and others – it gives you enough ti
me to be at peace.  To be at peace 
means to let go of desires.  Once you’re satisfied 
"for the time being, then you have a "
chance to let go of desires and be at peace.  This 
is the path that the Buddha taught.  
"By having a positive attitude to life, by developin"
"g the happiness of the mind, the "
mind becomes peaceful and tranquil.  
From that tran
"quillity, when cravings and "
"desires are temporarily subdued, you start to get c"
larity of the mind – not seeing 
things as you want to see them but as they truly ar
e.  You can only do this when you 
start from a position of ease and happiness. 
It’s almost like a trick to make you feel very happ
y and peaceful.  When I was reading 
the 
suttas
 I realized that this was how the Buddha taught.  H
e’d get people very 
"interested talking about ordinary things first and,"
 when he saw the audience were 
159
"really listening and they were happy, then he’d giv"
e it to them.  Or as one Tibetan 
"monk said, when he’s got everyone laughing and thei"
"r mouths are open, he can then "
pop in the medicine.  The medicine is stillness and
" peacefulness, because we find "
"there is nobody there, "
Metta
", non-self.  We find that which we took to be choic"
e is 
completely conditioned.  You think you are in contr
ol of everything.  You think that 
you chose to come here.  You think you chose to cou
gh or to move your arm this way 
"or that way.  I’ve looked at my choices, at my will"
", over many years, seeing what was "
conditioned 
and 
what 
was 
coming 
from 
"me, "
and 
I 
foun
d 
out 
that 
it 
was 
all 
conditioned.  That’s why I tell the same jokes agai
"n and again, I can’t help it.  It’s not "
me; it’s conditioning. 
Where Choice Ceases 
I’ve been giving talks for many years in Perth.  Ye
ars ago something happened to me; 
I had an experience that really shocked me to the c
ore.  It was one of those really 
powerful experiences.  This was before this 
Dhamma
 Hall was built.  We used to give 
the 
Dhamma
 talks in the community hall next door and our libr
ary was in what is now 
"the reception area.  One Saturday morning, I was br"
owsing through the audio tapes 
and I saw a tape cassette recording of a talk that 
I had given seven years previously.  It 
was on the same subject as the talk I had given the
 night before.  What I had said the 
night before was still fresh in my mind and I thoug
ht I would compare the two talks to 
see how I had changed over seven years.  I wanted t
o see if the talk I had given the 
night before was substantially different from the o
ne I gave seven years previously.  
When I played that tape it sent real shivers up my 
spine.  I found that I was repeating 
whole paragraphs almost word for word after a seven
-year separation between the 
talks.  The night before I had really thought that 
I was choosing every word with 
complete free choice and that my interpretation and
" my perception was fresh, but the "
coincidence was just too much.  If I really did hav
e free choice why was it exactly the 
"same, paragraph by paragraph?  It showed me that wh"
at I thought was free was not 
free at all but completely conditioned. 
It really affected me because it affected my sense 
"of self, my sense of will, my sense "
of direction in the world.  Who was actually pullin
g the strings?  Who was deciding 
"and making those choices?  It frightened me, but it"
 also gave me an intuition that I 
160
was able to follow to get into deep meditation.  Wh
"en there is no one left, when there "
"is no will left, when choice ceases and ends, this "
is where we can actually understand 
something of the unconditioned. 
The whole idea of non-self is difficult for many pe
ople because our conditioning will 
not allow us to see it.  The whole idea of the Budd
"ha’s teaching of suffering, of "
"dukkha"
", is very difficult for people.  Why?  Because they"
 don’t want to admit that life 
is suffering.  The whole idea of celibate monks is 
very difficult.  We still want to have 
our sexual relationships.  I seem to be forever rea
ding articles in magazines by people 
who are trying to see if they can still have sex an
d be Enlightened at the same time.  
"That’s what people want.  As the old saying goes, “"
they want to have their cake and 
eat it at the same time”.  You can’t have your cake
 and eat it.  What that old saying 
means is that if you eat the cake it’s gone.  You c
an’t keep the cake and also consume 
it.  You can have one thing or the other.  Often wh
en I talk like that people are 
shocked.  “What do you mean you have to be celibate
" to become Enlightened?”  I say, "
"“Yes, that’s true”, and they say, “Surely not,” wri"
"ggle, wriggle, wriggle, writhe, "
"writhe, writhe! "
What I’ve said is probably something that you will 
"not agree with.  Why, because that "
view goes completely against your perceptions.  Inf
ormed by that view the thoughts 
go against it.  You’re in that cycle.  But what abo
"ut Ajahn Brahm, isn’t he in his own "
cycle of views and perceptions and thoughts?  Isn’t
 that just a monk’s conditioning?  
The only way you can find out these things is to le
t go of all preconceived ideas and 
notions – make the mind so empty and so still that 
you can actually see things as they 
truly are and not through the eyes of a monk.  See 
things not through the eyes of a 
"sexually involved man or woman, not through the eye"
s of an Asian or a Westerner.  
But to see things as just empty of all those labels
 and positions”  let go of so much 
"that all of those ideas, positions, thoughts, and f"
eelings completely vanish.  Do you 
know what that’s called?  It’s called 
jhana
", deep meditation. "
What you have to do to be able to see the truth is 
"to creep up on it, silently, invisibly.  "
That’s the only way you can overcome the conditioni
ng.  In Buddhism we say the five 
"hindrances –sensory desire, ill will, restlessness "
"and worry, sloth and torpor, and "
doubt – are what stop you from seeing clearly.  Bas
ically sensory desire and ill will 
161
are the two main hindrances.  They are only overcom
e in those deep meditations 
called 
jhanas
".  The mystics, the people who sit meditation and g"
et into deep states of 
"mind, are overcoming all of their conditioning temp"
orarily.  They are letting go of all 
"they have been taught, all they have ever thought, "
"all that could be true or not true, "
and then they can see reality outside of conditions
.  What they see is not what they 
expected to find.  All great insights and Enlighten
ing wisdom will always shock you 
"to the core, and I really mean shock you to the cor"
e.  It’s not what you expected.  
What you expect is just conditioned.  What you can’
"t expect, what you can’t imagine, "
is what is true. 
That’s the reason all the philosophising imaginable
 and working things out can never 
reach the truth.  All movement of the mind misses t
"he point.  Only in silence, deep "
"stillness, can you understand the truth.  In partic"
"ular, you understand the nature of the "
"mind, the nature of happiness, and only then can yo"
u get a glimpse of what we call in 
Buddhism the ‘unconditioned’.  It is only when ever
ything is let go of – all you’ve 
"ever learnt, expected, found, or not wanted to find"
 – that you see what is true.  That’s 
the way to become Enlightened.  That’s the reason a
ll the Enlightened beings that I’ve 
"met in my life, people like Ajahn Chah, have been c"
ompletely unpredictable.  The 
conditioning just hasn’t been there.  That’s the re
ason you observe these people for 
many years and yet they always surprise you.  That’
s always been a sign of a very 
wise person.  Instead of always acting out of condi
tioning they are just incredibly 
"innovative, doing things in a way you would never e"
xpect.  That was one of the 
amazing things about Ajahn Chah; you always had to 
be on your toes because you 
never knew what he was going to do next.  He would 
"always shock you, one minute "
tearing you to shreds for doing what you thought wa
"s nothing, and then he would give "
you a cup of tea or send a cup of tea especially fo
r you.  With that degree of ‘being 
"beyond conditions’, one didn’t know what he was doi"
ng or why.  This is what we 
mean by going beyond conditions. 
"So, the moral of the story is that whatever you thi"
"nk is truth, you’re wrong.  What you "
think is right is already missing the point.  You t
hink you are in control of these 
"things, "
but 
you’re 
not. 
But 
you’ll 
never 
be 
able 
t
o 
accept 
that. 
It’s 
just 
too 
horrendous.  Take Nibb

na.  People have strange ideas about 
!!
.  But those 
162
ideas are not actually the true 
!!
", they are just what people want "
!!
 to be.  
What do you want 
!!
 to be?  That’s what you’ll believe 
!!
 is.  That’s the 
reason I sometimes teach the monks that 
!!
" is complete cessation, so much so "
that the monks have called it Ajahn Brahm’s black h
ole.  Everything gets ‘sucked 
away’ and there’s nothing left. 
"The monks ask, “What do you want to do that for?  I"
"s that the goal, is the whole "
purpose of all this just to of achieve a complete s
"piritual, mental, physical suicide, "
with 
everything 
stopping?” 
People 
want 
to 
enjoy 
!!
when 
it 
happens.  
Cessation is very hard for people to understand and
 accept.  But I say it’s true.  What 
do you make of that?  You are going to have to find
 out for yourself!  The Buddha 
said that Buddhas only point the way.  They point t
"o the path, but each one of us has "
to walk that path for ourselves. 
If you want to find out how much you are conditione
"d, how much you have been "
"completely brainwashed, then develop deep meditatio"
ns and have the courage to be 
shocked.  Have the courage to let go of everything 
including your own ego and self.  
Have that degree of strength because only the stron
g get to Enlightenment.  And I’m 
not talking about the strong in body; I’m talking a
bout the courageous ones who are 
willing 
to 
give 
everything 
up 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
truth
. 
This 
is 
how 
to 
overcome 
conditioning and brainwashing and to finally be fre
e.  People in this world think that 
"freedom is being able to do what you want, but gree"
"d, hatred, and delusion are "
controlling you.  You are not free at all.  If you 
"really want freedom, overcome those "
conditionings and see reality.  It will surprise yo
"u, but the truth of Enlightenment is "
very delightful.

11  EQUANIMITY 
23
rd
 August 2000 
In the last week somebody asked me to give a talk a
bout 
"
Upekkha"
", equanimity.  The "
subject of 
"
Upekkha"
 is something which I rarely talk about because it’
"s very profound, "
and how to apply it to one’s daily practice of medi
tation needs to be understood very 
"well.  Obviously, the best "
"
Upekkha"
 is that which happens after the attainment of the 
end of craving.  We can say that the one who has en
ded all craving is not out there to 
manipulate the world except out of compassion and l
oving-kindness.  They will most 
usually practise 
"
Upekkha"
", this looking on, this gazing on the world without"
 being 
"involved.  However, that’s the exalted state of an "

 and in the meantime we 
"have to know how we can use this concept, this prac"
"tice, this "
"
Upekkha"
", in our daily "
"lives, especially in the practice of meditation. "
Lessening the Defilements 
0Upekkha
 can be very easily misinterpreted as just allowing
 the defilements to roll 
along without getting involved.  One of the problem
s with the idea of 
"
Upekkha"
 in the 
"face of defilements is that sometimes, without enou"
"gh clarity of mindfulness, without "
"enough wisdom, one really thinks that one is lookin"
g on when in actual fact one is 
doing something.  Sometimes the degree of mindfulne
"ss, the degree of clarity of the "
"mind, to really discern whether one is "
practising e
"quanimity or not, "
is not 
high 
"enough.  So, we have to be very careful with this p"
ractise of equanimity. 
People often think that if they just leave the defi
"lements alone and do nothing, just "
watch 
and 
practise 
"equanimity, "
then 
if 
lust 
or 
ange
r 
come 
up 
they 
will 
just 
be 
equanimous about it.  They think this is just the w
"ay things are, the way things "
happen; they think they are letting go.  
But in truth they are not letting go
; they are 
"feeding the defilements, the three "
 #
", sensory desire, ill will, and delusion.  By "
feeding these defilements we can see that we’re not
 really practising equanimity. 
One of Ajahn Chah’s beautiful descriptions of equan
imity is the simile of the leaves 
"on the tree.  The leaves on the tree shake, they mo"
"ve backwards and forwards, but "
only when there is a wind.  If the wind dies down o
r the tree is protected from it so 
164
"that the air around it is not moving, then the leav"
"es will move less and less, until "
eventually they will stop.  So the sign that equani
mity is actually being practised is 
"that stillness grows in the mind, peace is developi"
"ng, and the mind is becoming more "
and more empty of movement.  We know that equanimit
y is being practised because 
things start to get more peaceful. 
"So bearing that in mind, we can see that the practi"
ce of equanimity in the early stages 
is done as a skilful means for overcoming some of t
he defilements that arise from time 
to time.  First of all we must recognise that thing
s like ill will and anger are never 
justified.  Things like sensory desire are always m
issing the point of the holy life.  We 
need to recognise that underneath all these defilem
ents is a huge amount of delusion.  
Sometimes we buy into that delusion by believing ou
rselves and arguing with the 
"teacher, or arguing with the teaching and believing"
 in the delusion.  It’s wonderful to 
"have the humility to be able to admit, “No, I’m not"
" a Stream Winner yet, I’m not an "
&
2
 and I’m not an 

" ”.  When we acknowledge that to ourselves, so that"
"we do realise that we don’t know, then we can have "
more trust and faith in the 
teachings of the Buddha and our teachers.  Bearing 
"that in mind, the teachings of the "
Buddha show you that you can know whether the path 
is being trodden.  You can 
know whether you are practising the right way.  You
 are practising the right way if the 
defilements get less and less. 
We understand that the path to lessening those defi
lements is the using of all the 
"skilful means that the Buddha gave to us, in partic"
ular the Eightfold Path.  This 
particular practice of equanimity must be related t
o the Four Right Efforts.  This was 
one of the aspects of the Eightfold Path which conf
used me for many years.  How can 
you put forth effort and then practise equanimity a
t the same time?  Surely 


", right effort, is the opposite of equanimity where"
 you’re supposed to do 
nothing.  But a closer examination of the meaning o
f the Four Right Efforts – the 
"striving, grabbing hold of the mind, initiating ene"
rgy and working hard to abandon 
"unwholesome states that have already arisen, keepin"
g unwholesome states yet to arise 
"from entering the mind, developing wholesome states"
 of mind and maintaining those 
wholesome states of mind that have already arisen –
 is needed.  How you apply them 
really depends upon the goal that you want to achie
ve.  You want to abandon and 
165
keep out unwholesome states and arouse and maintain
" wholesome states of mind, but "
how you do that depends upon the circumstances.  Th
ere are times when we grab hold 
of the mind and we actually do something and there 
are times when we just practise 
equanimity; it’s knowing when to do what and that m
akes one a skilful practitioner. 
It’s like the pain we experience from time to time 
"in monastic life, the physical pain "
"and the pain of disappointments, the pain of doing "
things we don’t want to do.  All 
those things are problems for the mind.  We can do 
one of two things.  We can try and 
"overcome the obstacles, try and work hard to do som"
ething.  But sometimes there is 
nothing we can do and then we need equanimity.  Ver
y often that’s the case with 
"physical pain; you go to the doctor, you try to do "
"exercises, you try to change your "
diet.  Sometimes it works but often it doesn’t.  So
 the practice of effort means that 
"there are times when we try to do something, but if"
" there is nothing that can be done, "
then we have to practice equanimity. 
Developing Equanimity 
Equanimity doesn’t mean just to endure.  Equanimity
 should always be practised 
alongside investigation because otherwise it will n
ot be able to be maintained and will 
turn into more problems.  Equanimity that is practi
sed alongside investigation – 
especially with pain – means you are not going to t
ry and get rid of the unpleasant 
"physical feelings, nor are you going to just grit y"
our teeth.  Equanimity should be 
"done with a sense of interest, with a sense of inve"
"stigation, with a sense of curiosity, "
finding out what these things really are.  That is 
a good way of dealing with 
"dukkha"
#
", physical pain:  you watch it with equanimity.  Yo"
u watch it in the same way 
"that a scientist needs to watch an experiment, with"
out a vested interest in what they 
"are going to find.  Because, if you’re looking for "
"something, if you’re looking to "
"prove your pet theory, then you’ll never have that "
"evenness of mind, you’ll never have "
the equanimity to be really able to see the truth. 
 You’ll only see what you’re looking 
for.  That’s what delusion is. 
With equanimity you have to put aside all prejudgem
"ent and all the past, because "
prejudgements arise from our past experiences and p
ast biases.  Practising equanimity 
you have to look upon the object that you find pain
ful as if seeing it for the first time.  
If you can do that then you really can see that thi
ng clearly and you can investigate it 
166
and find out what that pain really means and how it
 works.  It gives you a lot of 
"freedom, especially in monastic life, to understand"
 this thing called pain.  As you get 
older the physical pain will increase and the physi
cal body will be less able to 
overcome it.  It will get worse and worse until you
" die.  That’s your future, my future, "
and everybody’s future. 
So you have to have some understanding of physical 
pain and discomfort.  That’s 
"body awareness, body contemplation, because that is"
 where that physical pain usually 
arises.  If we can do this – look on pain with equa
nimity and investigation – we can 
gain a lot of freedom from pain and the fear of pai
n.  So often pain is fearsome 
because we never really know it.  We are always run
"ning away from it, trying to "
"overcome it, never stopping to look at it with equa"
nimity to find out exactly what it is.  
"The Buddha said there are two aspects to pain, two "
"thorns, a mental thorn and a "
physical thorn.  You can take out the mental thorn 
because the mental thorn is due to 
"wanting, not being at peace with, and not accepting"
 the physical pain.   That’s 
something you can control.  Very often you can do n
othing about the physical pain; 
it’s there until you die.  But taking away that men
"tal thorn, that mental dart, is "
something you can do from time to time.  The 

 does it all the time but with the 
"

"
", the ordinary person, and even with the "
&
" or the Steam Winner, "
sometimes that thorn is still there.  But you can p
ull it out so that you really are 
"looking on with equanimity.  As I said earlier, you"
 know you have equanimity in the 
"mind when everything gets peaceful, when there is n"
o struggle anymore. 
"When there is no craving, when there is no desire t"
o have any more than you have 
"right now, full equanimity gives rise to a beautifu"
l stillness and peace in the mind.  
And 
of 
course 
the 
deep 
reason 
for 
this 
is 
that 
the 
‘doer’ 
cannot 
coexist 
with 
equanimity.  
"Pure equanimity is clear and bright consciousness, "
without the ‘doer.’
"Many people think they have equanimity, but if they"
" are still doing things, it’s not "
"really equanimity, it’s not just looking on, it’s l"
ooking on and getting involved. 
"So, we can practise equanimity with physical pain. "
 We can also practise it with some 
"of the things that we have to do, things we don’t l"
"ike, things that we disagree with.  "
We can do this to overcome that ‘fault-finding’ min
"d, which I talk so much about in "
this monastery.  I talk so much about it because it
 is one of the big obstacles to living 
167
"happily in a monastery, or in any community; it’s a"
 great problem for living happily 
and gaining deep meditation.  When one is sitting o
n one’s cushion that fault-finding 
"mind is one of the big obstacles, and you can under"
stand that the fault finding mind is 
"very far removed from equanimity, from just looking"
 on.  With the fault-finding mind 
you 
are 
dealing 
with 
Panna
","
perception. 
Perception 
is 
searching 
out 
things 
to
complain about.  It’s a fascinating aspect of the m
"ind to be able to see, to be able to "
capture 
this 
"essence, "
because 
you 
see 
that 
this 
cre
ates 
so 
much 
suffering 
and 
disappointment and problems for you now and for lif
etimes to come.  Why is it that 
the mind is bent on finding faults?  Sure the fault
"s are there, but they are surrounded "
"by things that we can be grateful for, things that "
we can develop loving kindness 
"towards, things that we can develop the beautiful "
Citta
" towards, things we can be "
at peace with.  Why is it that so many human beings
 incline towards finding faults?  
They find faults with their fellows in the holy lif
"e, find faults in the monastery, find "
"faults in themselves, find faults in the "
Dhamma2
 and find faults in the meditation 
"cushions.  ‘It’s not good enough, they’re too lumpy"
’.  You can see that the fault-
finding mind creates work.  It creates conflict; it
 creates things to do; and it goes in 
the opposite direction to peace. 
"If, when we look at something which we cannot chang"
"e in the monastery, or in our "
"daily lives, when there is something which is irrit"
ating us – I’m not talking about 
"physical pain, I’m talking about irritations in the"
" schedule, in the routine etc. – when "
we 
can’t 
change 
it 
we 
can 
develop 
equanimity 
toward
s 
it. 
We 
know 
we 
have 
equanimity 
towards 
that 
irritation 
if 
the 
mind 
star
ts 
to 
become 
peaceful 
again.  
"There’s nothing we can do, so we do nothing.  We ju"
"st sit and be with it, and if it’s "
true equanimity there’s a lack of activity for the 
mind and it’s fully accepted.  The 
"mind is just looking on.  The ‘doer’, the fault-fin"
"ding mind, has ceased and the mind "
has developed a sense of stillness and peace. 
When you start sitting in meditation and something 
is irritating you – whether it’s a 
"thought from the past, in the bottom, or it’s too c"
old or too hot in your room – if you 
"can’t change it, if you can’t do anything about it,"
 try to develop equanimity.  For 
many years in my early life as a monk I practised t
hat by using a mantra called “No 
desire!  No desire!  No desire!” I would use that m
antra in the way that I encourage all 
168
"mantras, all words of instructions, to be used.  I "
"would mentally say it, but I would "
also listen to it afterwards:  listen to its echo a
"nd observe my mind, looking in the "
direction those words were pointing and following i
"n that direction.  If I said, “No "
desire!” I would watch my mind following obediently
 and having no desire for a few 
"seconds, then I would have to say it again to remin"
"d the mind.  “No desire, no desire, "
"no desire!” means no ‘doer’, it is letting go.  How"
"ever, I did notice that sometimes it "
didn’t work and the reason was that the mindfulness
", the clarity, was not strong "
enough to be able to do that.  I thought I was doin
g “No desire!” but there were 
"underlying desires, underlying currents of craving,"
" which I couldn’t see, which I "
hadn’t as yet perceived in my mental landscape. 
It was only later that I realised why it didn’t wor
k.  I could get rid of the worst of the 
"defilements, the cravings, and the doings, so at le"
ast I could get to some degree of 
peacefulness.  But certainly I hadn’t given up my d
"esire.  To be aware of desire, to be "
aware of the five-sense world – that underlying cra
"ving to see, hear, feel, smell, and to "
touch – is to understand those underlying cravings 
are not touched by that lesser 
"degree of letting go.  That is the reason, I found "
afterwards that the superficial 
equanimity needed a bit more power.  You have to fi
"nd a way, a means, to take the "
mind from the world of activity into the world of l
"etting go, into the dworld of "
equanimity. 
Deepening Equanimity 
The 
way 
to 
develop 
deeper 
equanimity 
is 
to 
develop 
the 
gradual 
perception 
of 
"happiness.  To see the happiness of not doing, the "
"happiness of equanimity, you have "
"to turn off the switches of doing, controlling, and"
 desire one by one in the correct 
order.  Then you start to see that concern with the
 past and the future is nothing to do 
"with equanimity at all, nothing to do with just loo"
king on.  You are the one sending 
"the mind off to the future, and you are the one sen"
ding it to the past. 
I remember the meditation instructions of the great
" teachers in Thailand, they always "
said ‘don’t send the mind here and there’.  Those g
reat teachers realised that it wasn’t 
"the mind going there by itself, but that you the me"
ditator were actually sending it 
"there.  You were ordering it there.  However, many "
people lacked the mindfulness to 
see that.  They were responsible for the mind going
 off to the future or the past.  They 
169
were willing it to go.  It was them willing it away
 from the present moment.  With 
"deeper mindfulness, with deeper awareness, you coul"
d actually see that the mind 
would naturally stay in the present moment if you l
et it.  It was only when you were 
"interested, when you valued the past, or when you w"
ere interested in or valued the 
"future, that you would send it somewhere else.  So,"
 seeing with deeper clarity just 
why the mind wandered off you could develop equanim
ity. 
 Having 
equanimity 
towards 
the 
"past, "
equanimity 
towards 
the 
"future, "
in
the 
sense 
that 
you 
weren’t 
"concerned with it, the mind would settle into the p"
resent moment all by itself.  You 
had turned off the switch of ‘doing the past’ and ‘
"doing the future’, in the same way "
"that tourists who go over to France or England, ‘do"
" France’, ‘do England’, or ‘do the "
United States’. 
"So you’re done with all that ‘doing’, finished with"
 all that travelling into the past and 
future.  With that degree of non-doing you can see 
that the next thing which you have 
"to give up is thinking.  Because we value thinking,"
 don’t ever get the idea that you’ll 
just watch the thinking and it’ll stop.  Don’t thin
"k you’ll just be equanimous about it, "
or that you’ll just see where the thinking goes.  I
t will go everywhere.  That won’t 
stop it because you’re not really equanimous to the
 thinking process.  If you were 
equanimous and you didn’t really care about thinkin
"g, it would stop.  But because you "
"care about it, because you value it, because you gi"
"ve it some degree of importance, "
because you ‘will’ it along by thinking ‘this is in
"teresting’, ‘this is fascinating’, you "
continue to get lost in thought. 
Thought is always one-sided.  It is never the full 
description of a person or an event.  
Often in my life I’ve followed thought and assumed 
that it could describe the person I 
was thinking about.  Not so.  But at least I gained
 the insight that I could never judge 
"another person, I could never figure them out; thin"
king could not do that.  I knew it 
"had been quite arrogant of me, and extremely stupid"
", to believe in any of the thoughts "
I 
may 
have 
had 
about 
another 
human 
being. 
Straight
away 
that 
got 
rid 
of 
all 
justification for anger and ill will towards others
.  Instead I started to disbelieve 
thinking and take away its value.  Then I had equan
"imity, I wasn’t trying to ‘do "
"thinking’, I wasn’t sending the mind off after thin"
king. 
Looking on is not talking about what you’re looking
" at; it’s just looking, nothing else, "
170
just 
observing. 
Surely 
the 
thinking 
mind 
has 
to 
st
op 
with 
the 
deepening 
of 
"equanimity, with the deepening of just looking, jus"
t observing.  You’re coming close 
to what is traditionally called the silent observer
.  It’s a very good metaphor for a 
"deepening of equanimity, the deepening of "
"
Upekkha"
.  The silent observer is someone 
who can look without saying anything.  It’s very ha
rd for a person to do that in the 
world.  People look and they give their opinion or 
they give their orders.  They say 
what should be done.  Even in this monastery it’s v
ery hard for someone to do 
anything without giving their input into how it can
" be done better.  Often in fact, it’s "
"how it can be done worse, but we all think we know "
how it can be done better.  Why 
do we do that?  Don’t we want to have simple lives?
  It’s enough having one abbot in 
the monastery without having twenty or thirty abbot
s.  If you really want to be an 
abbot just come along and I’ll give you the job! 
One of the nice things about being a junior monk is
 that you are not required to make 
any decisions; all you need to do is just go and si
"t in your hut all day.  However, when "
you are the junior monk you want to make the decisi
ons.  And then when you’re the 
"senior monk and have to make the decisions, it’s th"
"e last thing you want to do.  So, "
that’s just the craziness of life.  Equanimity is j
"ust bare attention, just watching, just "
looking and overcoming the thinking mind.  If you’r
e practising equanimity things 
have to stop and one of the things that should stop
 is thought.  Then you’re in the 
"centre with equanimity.  That means equilibrium, no"
"t in the past or in the future, just "
right now in the present moment; it’s centring the 
mind. 
Thoughts always take the mind away from the centre 
or away from the present 
moment.  Thoughts are usually old:  you are trying 
to describe and find some meaning 
for 
what 
happened 
in 
the 
"past, "
which 
disappeared 
ma
ny 
moments 
ago 
in 
the 
equilibrium of the present moment.  The still mind 
starts to go from one sense base to 
another.  What makes the mind go from one sense bas
e to another?  So often it’s a 
lack of the deepening of equanimity because there i
s still a sense of control – there is a 
"sense of interest in what’s happening in the ears, "
"the body, the toes.  That interest goes "
in the opposite direction to equanimity.  We have t
"o be able to take one object, the "
"breath, and have just bare attention on the breath,"
 just looking on it without trying to 
control it. 
171
How often is it that people start to meditate and t
hey can’t get the breath to be calm 
"and peaceful?  You know the reason for that, it’s b"
ecause they are still controlling.  
Controlling the breath makes it very unpleasant.  L
"eave it alone, let it go, don’t be "
"concerned about it, and then it’s very easy.  Why i"
s it that when we are listening to a 
"talk, eating lunch, or walking back from the dining"
" room to our huts, we breathe quite "
"naturally, quite easily, quite comfortably? That is"
 because we are nor really paying 
any attention.  Why is it that when we pay attentio
n to things they start to get 
uncomfortable? 
The 
reason 
is 
because 
when 
we 
pay 
a
ttention 
we 
tend 
to 
get 
"involved.  It’s the ‘doer’, the ‘controller’ again."
  It’s the doer and the controller acting 
in such a subtle way that many people can’t see it.
  They are trying to make the breath 
peaceful and quiet but it doesn’t become peaceful a
nd quiet.  Why is that?  It is 
because we are trying to do it; we are not practisi
ng equanimity; we are actually doing 
something. 
"In the same way when there is pain in the body, or "
when there’s irritation in our 
monastic 
"life, "
when 
there 
is 
irritation 
in 
the 
brea
th 
that 
we’re 
"watching, "
try 
"equanimity, "
"
Upekkha"
.  Don’t try to change the way the breath is going 
in and out.  
Don’t 
try 
to 
make 
it 
longer 
or 
shorter 
or 
smoother 
or 
whatever: 
even 
if 
it’s 
uncomfortable be equanimous with it.  Just leave th
e breath alone; just watch and 
investigate.  Be curious about what’s happening now
.  If we can practise that degree 
"of looking on with equanimity, with real "
"
Upekkha"
", then it’s a great tool for our "
meditation.  If the breath starts to be quiet and s
tarts to smooth out and become 
"comfortable, that’s a sign you’ve been practising "
"
Upekkha"
.  You know what 
"
Upekkha"
means and you 
also know how to apply it.  
When 
we p
ractise 
"
Upekkha"
 on the 
uncomfortable breath it turns into a very comfortab
le peaceful breath. 
We gain a lot of insight with such experiences beca
use that degree of 
"
Upekkha"
 can 
actually develop the breath into the ‘beautiful bre
ath’.  If you want the breath to be 
beautiful what should you do next?  Practise 
"
Upekkha"
", just look on, just wait, be "
"patient, don’t try to do anything.  The ‘doer’ come"
s from the fault-finding mind:  
"when it sees faults it’s not satisfied, it’s not co"
"ntent, and it’s going to do something "
about it.  That’s the nature of the fault-finding m
"ind, it’s a condition for doing.  Once "
we have 
"
Upekkha"
", there’s no fault-finding.  We are just looking wi"
"thout judging, "
172
"without valuing, without weighing one against the o"
ther.  We are not weighing the 
ordinary breath against the beautiful breath.  We a
re not weighing the beautiful breath 
against the 
nimmitta
.  We are not weighing 
Citta
 against 
jhanas
.  We are not 
weighing anything or evaluating; we are just lookin
g on to see what happens.  And if 
we have done 
"
Upekkha"
 enough to turn the uncomfortable breath into a com
fortable 
"breath, then we can very easily continue that degre"
e of 
"
Upekkha"
", that ‘just looking’ "
"aspect of the mind, just "
"
Upekkha"
", "
"
Upekkha"
", "
"
Upekkha"
.  You’ll notice the breath will get 
beautiful all by itself.  It will get soft and peac
"eful, slow and refined.  It will become "
calm because this is what 
"
Upekkha"
 does. 
0Upekkha
" takes the business away, takes all disturbances aw"
ay.  It takes the wind from 
the leaf so that the leaf wobbles and shakes less a
nd less.  This is just what you’re 
"seeing, the mind vibrating less and less as it gets"
" more and more still, as it gets more "
"and more beautiful, as it gets more and more energy"
.  But be careful in these stages:  
when you start to get energy in the beautiful breat
"h and lots of bliss comes up, that "
can excite the mind.  And so instead of looking on 
with 
"
Upekkha"
 you start to get 
excited.  Looking on with excitement.  “Wow!  This 
is really good; at last I’m getting 
somewhere.”  That’s not 
"
Upekkha"
", that’s another type of wind, and it starts to sha"
ke 
the leaf again. 
The Perfection of Equanimity 
If you develop 
"
Upekkha"
 from the very beginning you can very easily carry 
it though as 
an 
important aspect 
of your 
attention. 
 Remember 
al
"so, "
"
Upekkha"
is just 
looking 
closely.  Be very careful here that when the breath
" becomes refined, you don’t get lost "
"in a lack of mindfulness, where you can’t really se"
e clearly what’s going on.  If you 
cultivate 
"
Upekkha"
", it’s a very clear seeing, but a very silent seein"
g.  It’s like seeing just 
"with eyes and having no hands to mess things up, ju"
st the armless seer.  If you can do 
this then everything starts to happen as a natural 
process because the ‘doer’ has been 
taken away and you are just looking on with 
"
Upekkha"
. 
When the beautiful parts of the meditation start to
" happen, the beautiful breath and the "
nimitta
" start to come up, the mind doesn’t wobble and shak"
e because it’s been set up 
with 
"
Upekkha"
.  The mind is generating the ability to just look 
on clearly without 
173
"getting involved, just being a spectator to the who"
le process.  And if you are just a 
"spectator to the whole process, the process takes o"
ver and carries you into beautiful 
nimitta
:  you don’t care if that turns into a 
jhana
", whether it disappears, or where it "
"goes or what it does, because your job is just to l"
"ook.  You’re a passive observer, just "
like a person in an aeroplane looking out of the wi
"ndow, you can’t tell the pilot to go "
faster or to go slower.  The pilot will go accordin
g to his own reasons; your job is just 
to look out of the window.  With 
"
Upekkha"
", this is what you’re doing just looking out "
of the window of the mind on to all these beautiful
 things happening.  And if you’re 
just 
looking 
"on, "
you’re 
looking 
without 
"fear, "
witho
ut 
"excitement, "
without 
doing 
anything.  With real 
"
Upekkha"
" there is no fear, there is no excitement.  If any "
fear or 
excitement comes up it means you’ve lost the 
"
Upekkha"
. 
Using 
"
Upekkha"
 as the key you can enter into the 
jhanas
.  
0Upekkha
 becomes an 
inclination of the mind.  With that inclination of 
"the mind prominent, when you enter "
the first 
jhana
", that will take you through the wobble of the mind"
.  The wobble of 

" in the mind, even though it’s subtle and pre-verba"
l will be seen by 
"
Upekkha"
" will see that as ‘doing’, as a movement of the min"
d.  The inclination to 
"
Upekkha"
" will unlock and discard that last bit of ‘doing’, "
and develop into the second 
jhana
 where there is absolute stillness.  
0Upekkha
 will discard the bliss of the second 
jhana
":  bliss that is so joyful, so what!  "
0Upekkha
" will look and, because it’s just "
looking and inclining towards bliss but not giving 
"it any more energy, just like the leaf "
"it will begin to wobble less and less, until the bl"
iss will just give way to the most 
refined happiness you’ve ever experienced.  If the 
inclination towards 
"
Upekkha"
 has 
been strong in the beginning been maintained in the
" middle, it will be the cause for the "
abandoning of happiness and the consequent abiding 
in the fourth 
jhana
", where there "
is just the perfection of 
"
Upekkha"
", pure mindfulness, with no doing or movement of th"
e 
mind. 
In the fourth 
jhana
 you have the summit of 
"
Upekkha"
" and, if you can experience "
"something like that, then you know the full meaning"
 of the word 
"
Upekkha"
.  By 
developing 
immaterial 
jhanas
", "
eventually 
the 
"
Upekkha"
"of equanimity, "
ceases 
too.  
"When one emerges after experiences such as that, it"
 underscores the problem of this 
thing we call the ‘doer’.  You start to see what we
 call the ‘doer’ and why 
"
Upekkha"
 is 
174
"so difficult to attain.  It is because the ‘doer’, "
"as well as consciousness, is taken to be a "
"self, to be me, to be mine.  It is my problem, some"
"thing that I am concerned about, "
something that is so close to me.  It is something 
that we cling to no matter what. 
Conclusion 
We have to see though the practise of 
"
Upekkha"
 that all these things have to disappear 
so we can uncover the truth of 
Metta
", non-self.  There is nobody in here; the five "

 are just completely empty.  There is no one who ow
ns these 

.  
These 

 don’t constitute a self or a soul; there is nothin
g there.  And then 
through the experience of 
"
Upekkha"
", we get so close that we can see these truths.  As"
"soon as those truths are seen, "
"
Upekkha"
 becomes just a natural manifestation of that 
insight.  When we see that there is no one who owns
" any of this, why should we cling "
to those things when we know that they are just the
 play of nature?  Why should we 
try and do all of this?  This is the understanding 
at long last that the rain will come 
down and the sun will shine according to nature.  W
ho can predict it?  No one can.  
We then stop craving for a sunny day or craving for
 rain.  It’s foolish to crave for such 
things.  They are completely out of our control.  I
n the same way we stop craving for 
pleasure and pain.  We stop craving for things to b
e this way or that way according to 
our convenience.  What about other people’s conveni
ence?  Why do we always want 
things to be our way?  In the end we know we can’t 
"get our own way, so we give up, "
"we let go, we abandon, and develop that equanimity "
to the world we know we cannot 
control.  All that we can do is guide it from time 
to time. 
The 

" has been through that process, has seen the value "
of equanimity and how 
equanimity 
is 
an 
Enlightenment 
factor. 
The 
occurre
nce 
of 
that 
equanimity 
will 
manifest 
as 
the 
.
", "
as 
beautiful 
loving 
"kindness, "
"compassion, "
and 
sympathetic joy.  If there is something to do then 
"they will do something for others, to "
try 
and 
encourage 
that 
same 
equanimity. 
When 
there
is 
that 
full 
equanimity 
"established, then there are no more "
kamma
 formations manifesting.  That which 
"creates rebirth, the distinction between pleasure a"
"nd pain, distinction between what I "
"like and what I don’t like, all that is disappearin"
"g, and there is just equanimity.  With "
"that degree of equanimity, looking on with curiosit"
"y, you can see so easily that the "
causes of rebirth have disappeared.  Equanimity is 
like the fire going out; it’s cool.  
175
"Craving is like the hot fire.  The more you want, t"
he more ill will is going to come up 
in your mind and you’re going to have anger towards
" yourself, towards the world, or "
towards whatever.  Remember that fire burns anythin
"g, but it’s not the wood’s fault, "
"the paper’s fault, or the grass’ fault.  It’s the f"
ire’s fault for being hot.  So it’s not 
somebody else’s fault.   if you’re angry with them 
or have ill will.  It’s your fault.  
"There is not enough equanimity there, there is not "
"enough peace, and there is not "
enough stillness.  The more craving there is the mo
re 
kamma
" is being made, the more "
"you are making your future births, making your futu"
"re abidings in this world, abidings "
of suffering. 
The real equanimity which I’ve been describing is t
he equanimity which leads to 
"silence, which leads to peace, which leads to still"
"ness, which leads to "
jhanas
", which "
leads to the ending of things.  Those equanimities 
are the equanimities which lead to 
!!
".  To sum up, be very careful:  equanimity is not j"
ust allowing things to be.  It 
"is not equanimity unless, when you allow things to "
"be, they start to disappear and get "
quiet and still and peaceful.  Always measure equan
imity by the degree of stillness it 
"creates, seeing if it ends things and leads to "
&
", the fading away of the problem.  "
And then test it out!  Once you know what equanimit
"y truly is, you can use it in all "
"aspects of your life, enabling you to do all those "
things that you don’t really like to do.  
"If you do things with equanimity, they don’t move t"
"he mind, they don’t worry the "
"mind, and they don’t make the mind shake and trembl"
e.  You can use equanimity in 
the meditation practise and you can use it at those
 times when you’re sick.  You can 
use that equanimity born of letting go at the time 
of your death and then you can be 
"free.  So please, if you can find "
"
Upekkha"
"; silent awareness, looking, having eyes but "
"no hands, see that it can assist your happiness in "
this monastery and your contentment 
in monastic life.  And use it especially to help yo
u develop your meditation.

12  REFLECTIONS THAT ARE CONDUCIVE 
TO LIBERATION 
6
th
 Sept. 2000 
Earlier 
this 
week somebody 
asked 
if 
I could give 
a 
talk 
on 
the four 
objects 
of 
contemplation 
in 
the 

"Sutta"
(MN 
118)
.
Those 
things 
one 
should 
contemplate when one has just emerged from a deep s
tate of 
samadhi
","
 a deep state of 
calm.  How can one use these four reflections as ta
ught by the Buddha to weaken the 
defilements and undermine the illusions caused by t
he defilements?  How can one use 
these reflections to see the 
Dhamma
", to release the mind. and gain the powers and the "
fruits of the practice? 
It’s my experience that whatever the Buddha said in
 the 
"suttas"
 always has a very 
profound and deep meaning.  And because it’s profou
nd and deep it has a very 
powerful effect on the mind.  It has in a much grea
ter result than you anticipate.  So 
when the Buddha advised in the 

"Sutta"
" to contemplate these four things, "
they are obviously very powerful reflections.  I’m 
sure most of you would know what 
those 
four 
reflections 
are. 
In 
case 
you 
have 
forgo
tten 
them 
they 
are 

"(impermanence), "
&
(fading 
"away, "
"dispassion), "

(cessation)
","
and 
	&&
"(letting go, abandoning)"
.
   You all think you know the meaning of 
anicca
and you might think you know the meaning of 
&
", "

 and 
	&&
.  But 
if you really knew the meaning of those things you 
would be able to uproot the 
defilements and see non-self.  You would be able to
 give up clinging to the wheel of 

. 
All these words signify something.  It’s only when 
we fully understand what they’re 
pointing to and completely understand their meaning
 that we can say that we know 
those 
things. 
A 
sign 
that 
you 
understand 
is 
that 
t
he 
mind 
is 
released 
and 
you 
"experience enormous peace, bliss, and a sense that "
something has been destroyed. 
Freeing the Mind 
"So, "
this 
is 
much 
more 
than 
a 
mere 
intellectual 
gras
p 
of 
concepts. 
This 
is 
the 
experiencing of those concepts.  It’s actually bein
g 

", feeling that thoroughly and "
177
completely.  It’s being 
&
", it’s being "

", and it’s being "
	&&
.  In the 
"other words, it’s understanding it so completely an"
d fully that it’s as if one is standing 
"in the middle, in the very centre of these words, a"
nd seeing in all directions exactly 
what they mean from the inside out.  This is what w
e mean by the power of the mind 
to create insight. 
It’s very significant that the Buddha places these 
reflections after the first twelve steps 
of the 

"Sutta"
.  The first twelve steps are deliberately arranged
 to create 
those states that we call 
jhanas
.  And since as we are passing through these twelve
states I’ll bring everyone’s 
attention to the state
"s of breathing in, breathing out, "
developing 
"
"
", experiencing "
"
"
", and experiencing "

. 
"Those of you whose meditation has yet to take off, "
will do well to really reflect on 
these instructions of the Lord Buddha.  When you’re
 doing the meditation on the 
"breath, when you are watching the breath, when you "
"have the breath in mind, don’t "
just watch any old ordinary boring breath.  Make a 
"resolution, a gentle suggestion to "
the 
"mind, "
“May 
I 
breathe 
in 
just 
experiencing 
"
"
", "
may 
I 
breathe 
out 
experiencing 
"
"
".”  The bliss, the happiness of contentment, is ach"
ieved by 
developing the perception of the ‘beautiful breath’
", in my terminology.  Once you "
start to develop that then your meditation has some
 power.  You are getting into the 
nitty gritty of the meditation on the breath.  You 
will find that you don’t have to force 
"the mind.  The mind wants to play around with this,"
" it wants you to sit more and more, "
it wants to have more and more seclusion.  The mind
 starts to move away from the 
"worldly interactions between people, books, food, a"
nd sleep.  The mind wants to have 
more time with this beautiful breath.  It is satisf
ied.  Incline the mind to go ever 
deeper into ever more profound states of stillness 
and bliss. 
Each one of the first twelve stages of the 

"Sutta"
 are calming the mind and 
feeling 
"
"
" evermore deeply, evermore calmly.  And the last st"
ages bring the 
"mind to this sense of stillness and relinquishment,"
 freeing that mind of the previous 
steps.  Freeing the mind means bringing it into the
jhana
 realms.  It is freeing the mind 
"from the world of the five senses, freeing it from "
"the last vestiges of the hindrances, "
"freeing it from the body, freeing it from the sense"
s.  That’s what we mean by freeing 
178
"the mind, and that’s the "
jhanas
. 


Anicca



3#
 those 
jhanas
" have been achieved, the mind is so powerful, deep,"
 and profound 
and it has the ability to really contemplate fully.
  The mind should then take up one of 
"these four reflections, in the sense of just sugges"
ting to the mind ‘

’
.  
The mind 
has already been well enough conditioned through he
aring the 
Dhamma
", through "
reading the 
Dhamma2
 and through some of the insights that you have alr
"eady attained, "
that it should have enough of a clue to get on to t
he scent of 

.  Just as a dog 
finds the scent of some buried treasure or some ill
icit drugs and follows that to its 
"source, the mind finds out what "

 is truly about. 
Once the mind is powerful it can follow the scent. 
 That is called 
yoniso manasikàra
", "
the work of the mind which goes back to the source.
  Just like a bloodhound finding 
the source of a scent and following it unerringly t
"o its place of origin, this is what one "
does with the contemplation of 

.  Don’t use just your thinking mind and all the 
ideas you had about 

" in the past, because many of those thoughts will n"
ot be 
capable of releasing the mind from the 
asava
","
 from the 
 #
", the defilements and "
the fetters.  That would be a superficial investiga
tion.  If you just suggest 

to the 
"mind – it’s amazing, even though these will be area"
"s which you’ve never seen before, "
places where the mind has never gone before – becau
se of the power of the mind you 
will 
be 
able 
to 
penetrate 
those 
areas 
of 
the 
Dhamma
wherein 
the 
treasure 
of 
"Enlightenment lies.  You’ll be able to go deeper, n"
ot just into your old ideas but into 
something 
very 
new 
and 
very 
"profound, "
into 

", "
the 
"impermanence, "
the 
"instability, the irregularity, the lack of continui"
ty. 
"These words are pointing to one thing, one aspect o"
"f the experience of life, of being.  "
You see it as something that is completely insubsta
ntial.  To see it like that simile for 
#
", "
or 
"sensation, "
a 
drop 
of 
water 
falling 
on 
a 
puddle
", "
‘Plop!’ 
it’s 
gone.  
Experience it.  Even with a fast camera you can har
dly catch that moment.  It arises 
"and passes away so fast that all you can say, as th"
"e Buddha explained, is that there is "
something there because an arising is seen.  But at
" the same time it is substantial, "
because its passing away is seen almost immediately
 afterwards.  And this is what we 
179
"take to be life, what we take to be the world, what"
" we take to be ‘me’, what we take to "
be mine.  It is something so insubstantial that you
 can hardly catch hold of it because 
it’s passing so quickly. 
You allow the mind that has been empowered by the d
eep states of 
samadhi
 to play 
"around in that area, to be drawn ever deeper into t"
"he full meaning of that word.  And, "
as with many searches leading to deep insights one 
will always have to overcome the 
two barriers of fear and excitement in order to get
 to the very heart of these things. 
The barriers of fear and excitement are not just ba
rriers to 
jhanas
 they are also barriers 
to deep insight.  We fear insight because it destro
"ys something that is very close to us, "
"something that we’ve got so used to, which we feel "
literally naked without.  Just as 
we’d feel embarrassed and afraid of taking our clot
hes off in the hall with all these 
people around because we’d feel unnatural and insec
"ure, in the same way, when you "
take away these clothes that are your ego and you’r
"e sense of self, when you undress "
"all those views and see what’s truly there, it can "
be very fearsome.  It takes a great 
"deal of courage, the courage that can only be gener"
ated from deep states of 
samadhi
.
"The monks, hermits, and sages of the past, who dwel"
t in caves in the mountains and in 
"the forests, have always been known for their coura"
ge.  Not just the courage to live in 
such harsh conditions – the dealing with the pains 
"of the body, the lack of food, or the "
lack of sleep – but the courage to face the obstacl
es to deep insight.  They were 
willing to die for the truth.  And when I say willi
"ng to die, it’s not just in the sense of "
"the body dying, but also all their ideas and views,"
" their ego, their pride, everything "
that they’ve ever known or hoped to know has to be 
"abandoned, given up.  "
That is the 
courage of letting go
!  Usually it’s only when the mind has the power of
 deep 
meditation 
that 
one 
can 
really 
be 
courageous 
and 
ov
ercome 
that 
fear. 
One 
is 
"empowered, strong, like a great warrior who goes ag"
ainst an army of thousands and 
scatters them with the confidence and courage energ
ised by the power of 
samadhi
.  
"But excitement can also come up so easily, the exci"
tement of seeing something deep 
"and profound.  “Wow!  At last!”  That thought, that"
" movement of the mind, obstructs "
the attainment of deep 
samadhi
 and stops the attainment of insight.  To overcome 
the 
fear and to overcome the excitement so that you can
" really see truth for what it is, you "
180
need the calm which is developed by deep 
samadhi
".  You need that sense of inactivity, "
"the stability of the mind that does not react, but "
"which just sits there and watches, no "
matter what happens.  The sort of mind that can sit
 there and just watch even if 
'
ā

"comes and says “Boo!”, or if a beautiful lady comes"
 and strips naked in front of you.  
It is a mind that is absolutely unmoved no matter w
hat happens. 
Once you abandon those obstacles to insight you fin
d the mind wants to find the truth.  
The truth of something like 

", releases the mind from its prison, "

.  It 
shatters the fetters; it arouses the bliss of freed
"om.  It’s that joy, happiness, and bliss "
"born of freeing the mind from what one intuitively,"
 instinctively knows is a great 
"burden, "
a 
great 
"suffering, "
a 
great 
cause 
of 
torture
to 
the 
mind 
and 
the 
body.  
"Instinctively one knows that, and the mind delights"
 in getting closer to finding the key 
that unlocks all our chains and frees the mind from

 once and for all.  There is 
something delightful about that insight.  Once one 
can get past those barriers that 
"delight will just draw the mind ever inwards, to pl"
ay with the meaning of 
anicca
", to "
"get to know it intimately, to penetrate to its very"
" heart, to its very core.  So, you now "
know what the Buddha meant by 

 and you know what Venerable 
)4**
meant in the 
Dhamma
"Sutta"
 (SN LVI. 11) that we just chanted: 

*
"samudaya"
!!

– 
all 
arisings 
are 
of 
the 
nature not just to cease but to stop once and for a
"ll, to end completely in "

.  
"That is, all, everything, the complete works, which"
 is truly amazing.  You start to see 
"that all this that we know, all the "
dhammas
", are of the very nature to cease completely "
with no remainder.  
!!
" becomes clear, "
!!
" becomes possible, and "
!!
becomes obvious:  It is the ceasing of all things –
 the flame going out and the fire 
completely quenched until there is no trace of that
 fire.  Even the imprint of that fire is 
completely gone. 
"When one can see the actual ceasing of things, in t"
he same way as 
)4**
" saw, one "
"sees that, whether it’s the body, feelings, percept"
"ions, formations, or consciousness – "
all the six types of consciousness –all of these th
ings are of that nature to cease 
completely without any remainder.  You see that all
 of these things that we take to be 
"real, that we take to be hard and solid, are of the"
 nature to disappear without any 
remainder.  You see 

" to that degree; not just as the rise and fall, wit"
h the fall 
181
"giving the energy for another rise, but the rise an"
"d fall with no energy left, with "
nothing 
"remaining, "
without 
anything 
to 
give 
rise 
to
new 
"experiences, "
to 
new 
phenomena.  So many people in the world think of 

" as a ping pong, a yo-yo, just "
"going up and down, never seeing the full meaning of"

.  Because they don’t 
"understand cessation, because they can’t see the re"
"al emptiness, the real "
"
**"
 of the 
"sensory world, of the five "

", they can’t see the emptiness of everything.  They"
still think that somewhere there is something real.
  Without seeing the ending of 
everything we will always think that somewhere ther
e is something solid.  Somewhere 
"‘I am’.  Somewhere is the real me, the cosmic me, t"
"he cosmic all, or whatever we try "
and posit the ‘self’ as.  
Anicca
" is insubstantiality, irregularity, something:  whi"
ch was 
"is no longer there, as if this whole hall had sudde"
nly vanished without anything 
"remaining, "
not 
even 
the 
shadow. 
Just 
complete 
empt
"iness, "
not even 
a 
"vacuum, "
"nothing left.  Nothing you can measure, nothing you"
" can rationalise, nothing, just "
emptiness.  Gone!  Only when one can see 

 to that degree has one got a hope of 
understanding 
what 
the 
Buddha 
meant 
by 
the 
Four 
Nob
le 
"Truths, "
and 
what 
the 
Buddha meant by 
Metta
", non-self. "
These are all aspects of one thing.  So if you can 
"put those ideas, suggestions, and "
"guides, into the mind, the mind might then follow. "
 The mind might go deep; it might 
go so deep that it goes to the heart of 


"you come out afterwards, then you’ll be able to say"

Also all your moments of consciousness:  one day no

People talk about 
&
 as being dispassion but that’s only one possible m
eaning for 
the word.  The meaning that I prefer is fading away
.  It’s almost like a precursor to 

", something that happens before cessation is experi"
enced:  
&
", the fading "
away of things.  After you’ve experienced a 
jhana
", you can contemplate that word "
&
", fading away.  The whole idea of fading away is re"
linquishment.  It’s not 
"relinquishing things, rather it’s you doing the dis"
"appearing act, you becoming the "
"invisible man, so invisible that you just completel"
y disappear and nothing is left.  In 
this way there is the fading away of all phenomena:
"  the fading away of the body, the "
fading 
away 
of 
the 
world 
"outside, "
the 
beautiful 
fad
ing 
away 
of 
feelings 
– 
the 
happiness and sadness that occupies the mind even m
ore than thoughts. 
The great problem of existence is pleasure and pain
.  Wouldn’t it be wonderful to 
"have an end to that problem, to have all the busine"
"ss finished once and for all, to have "
all your work completed?  How can you ever rest whe
n you have pleasure and pain?  
"How can there ever be comfort, contentment, stillne"
"ss, and peace when "
#
 is still 
active?  It’s impossible.  People in the world try 
to generate 
#
", try to generate "
intense 
#
", thinking that that is the way to experience happi"
ness and fulfilment in 
this world.  Sometimes people watch films that frig
hten the hell out of them or they go 
to sad movies where they cry their eyes out.  It’s 
amazing:  they just want more 
"intense pain, more intense pleasure.  That’s the wa"
y of the world.  The way of the 
"Buddha, the way of the "

" (recluse), is to calm all of this, to watch it fad"
e away – 
to watch the 
#
" of the world, the intensity of feelings of the wor"
"ld, get less and "
less and disappear.  The longer you stay in monasti
c life the more you see that now 
you don’t shake and quiver with 
#
 as you did as a lay person.  You see that 
whatever 
the 
world 
gives 
you 
with 
its 
"vagaries, "
wit
h 
its 
"uncertainties, "
the 
mind 
doesn’t shake.  What before would be a very unpleas
ant 
#
", now doesn’t shake "
the mind.  What before would be incredibly pleasant
" and exciting, now is not.  The "
#
 is beginning to fade away and with that fading awa
y of 
#
 comes a 
softening.  With the gentling of 
#
" you get this beautiful peace, and that peace by "
itself is a type of happiness which people in the w
"orld can rarely even understand, let "
183
alone experience. 
People in the world think that if all 
#
 starts to disappear then how can there be 
happiness.  How can there be bliss when you’re not 
"doing anything, just sitting quite "
still?  The most bliss you can ever experience in t
his realm is in deep meditation.  
Sitting 
here 
some 
of 
you 
have 
experienced 
it 
yourse
lves. 
If 
you 
really 
want 
"happiness, the happiness of the mind exceeds all ot"
her pleasures; it not only exceeds 
"them in its amplitude of happiness, in its degree o"
"f pleasure, of raw bliss, but also in "
its depth and profundity.  This is not a shallow su
perficial thing; this is something that 
is a rich happiness which you sense when you experi
ence it.  It’s happiness that is 
going to the core; it’s not just covering you in so
me fine raiment that you understand 
is not real.  There is something real and meaningfu
l here.  As you go into that deep 
"happiness, into that deep stillness, you understand"
 that through the calming of 
#
"you get all the contentment, all the satisfaction t"
hat you ever wanted.  From the fading 
away comes the treasure of getting closer to emptin
"ess, getting closer to "

 and 
!!
", where everything is gone.  When one understands "
&
 in this particular 
way it will lead you not just into insight but also
 into calm.  It will lead to your ‘self’ 
"fading away, the knower and the doer disappearing, "
"fading, fading, fading.  And as "
you play around with that concept you begin to unde
rstand not just the end of the 
"path, not just "
!!
", but you understand why you are practising this Ei"
ghtfold Path.  
You understand that 
&
 is all about fading away. 
When you start practising the precepts and the rule
s of the monastery so much of the 
harshness of your character fades away.  That’s the
 reason people who have been 
"monks or nuns for many years become very soft, gent"
"le, friendly beings, people "
whom 
lay-people 
just 
love 
to 
be 
around. 
It’s 
as 
if
all 
of 
their 
harshness 
and 
unpleasantness has faded away.  That’s the result o
"f the precepts, of keeping rules, of "
keeping 
 
".  Certain aspects of your personality fade, and it"
’s wonderful to see the 
fading away of what is really quite unwholesome:  y
"our ill will, bad speech, and bad "
actions.  When they fade away you understand what t
his path is all about.  Once those 
things fade away you can see how through sense rest
raint other things are also fading 
away:  those excitements and titillations that once
 would occupy your whole day are 
fading away.  You’re allowing all your old memories
 to fade away – all of the past 
184
with all of its difficulties and also its pleasures
.  You allow it all to fade away to 
"become a person with no history, no past, someone w"
ho can let go of time.  All your 
"worries and plans about the future, they too are fa"
ding away. 
In the lay world people spend almost all of their l
ife in the past or the future.  When 
that fades away you’re left with the beautiful pres
"ent moment, just the ‘now’.  Once "
things start to fade away you understand that you h
ave to allow thinking to fade.  Not 
"to cut it out and stop it, not to try and destroy i"
"t – that’s just doing it through power, "
"self, and ego, through a sense of ‘me’ – but to all"
ow it to fade.  The word 
&
 is 
beautiful in its meaning.  By taking away your inte
"rest, by taking away your sense of "
"value in these things, they fade and disappear, if "
you’re patient enough to give them 
"time.  They fade, and you find yourself meditating "
on the breath.  Everything else has 
"faded away:  your past and your future, all those s"
"tupid thoughts, all of your business, "
all of your lust.  The body is about to fade away b
ecause all you have is just the one 
breath you are watching.  So much has faded and dis
"appeared, and now you are "
watching the breath fade away.  The breath gets sof
"ter and softer, more and more "
"beautiful, and more and more profound, fading, fadi"
"ng, fading.  With the fading away "
of 
"the breath, the "
"‘doer’, this very active, proble"
"matical control freak, is fading, "
"fading, fading.  It’s hardly doing anything at all."
  When you get to the beautiful breath 
nothing much is happening; even consciousness is fa
ding.  Instead of consciousness 
being 
spread 
all 
over 
the 
"place, "
much 
of 
consciousn
ess 
has 
faded 
away. 
Sight 
"consciousness, "
sound 
"consciousness, "
all 
"faded, "
disa
ppeared. 
Smell 
and 
taste 
"consciousness, faded away into nothing, ended, ceas"
ed.  You’ve just got this very 
"refined sense of touch on the breath, just in this "
"moment, a very subtle breath, nothing "
else is felt in the body.  It’s all fading away.  T
hat gives you so much happiness and 
pleasure 
because 
"dukkha"
is 
"fading, "
disappearing. 
At 
last 
you 
are 
beginnin
g 
to 
understand the Path.  The Path that you’ve been hop
"ing for, the Path that you ordained "
"for, the path you have been searching for, studying"
 for.  What you’ve been born for is 
happening.  You are experiencing the fading away of
 suffering – not just thinking 
"about it, not writing a book about it – but you’re "
right there when it’s happening and 
"it’s beautiful, wonderful, and inspiring.  You see "
the 
Dhamma
 start to manifest as 
suffering fades away.  The process takes over becau
se this is what the mind has been 
born for; this is why the whole process is happenin
g at last.  Once you start to allow 
185
"everything to fade away, the breath fades and you’r"
e just left with a 
Citta
.  The 
Citta
 was there all along just covered by the breath.  W
hen the breath fades it 
reveals 
the 
nimmitt

. 
The 
simile 
the 
Buddha 
gave 
is 
that 
it 
is 
like 
th
e 
clouds 
obscuring the full moon.  When the clouds part the 
moon manifests.  The moon was 
there all the time it was just that it was covered.
  The moon here is the reflection of 
your mind.  It’s always there; you’re just attendin
g too much to all these other things.  
"When the breath fades away, there is the mind exper"
ienced as the 
Citta
.  It allows 
"the last bit of the ‘doer’ to fade away, things dis"
"appear, and you enter a "
jhana
. 
Whenever you experience the 
jhanas
 and reflect on them you see they are all stages of
letting go.  That’s the reason a lot of people can’
t gain 
jhanas
:  they are holding on to 
"too much attachment, too much clinging; they just w"
on’t let these things fade.  They 
try to either make them fade or try and keep them o
"ut of fear, out of stubbornness.  "
But the way into 
jhana
 is to allow them to fade away.  The fading away of
 the ‘doer’ 
is completed in the second 
jhana
.  The fading away of consciousness now starts to 
happen as more and more things are let go of.  The 
mind gets more and more refined 
in these different stages of 
jhana
", until everything fades away completely in the "
experience of 

".  Afterwards, you see that the whole process is a "
process of 
"giving up, letting go, abandoning, and relinquishin"
g. 




All these beautiful 
Pali
 words in Buddhism are seen as an experience.  You’
ve walked 
"on the path and they have been the signposts, the s"
ights along the way.  This is what it 
looks like on the journey.  This is the territory a
"nd, as these things all fade away, you "
understand 
what 
&
truly 
means. 
+&
is 
the 
Path. 
By 
letting 
"go, "
by 
"relinquishing, all these things happen by themselve"
s.  But you especially understand 

", the ending, the cessation of things.  That is a v"
ery hard word to understand 
because we only know things that are there.  It’s h
ard to perceive something that is not 
there. 
Without 
understanding 

we’re 
especially 
unlikely 
to 
allow 
the 
possibility of that which we are truly attached to 
"and cling to, to cease.  It’s always "
"partial.  Those things that we don’t like, that we "
"don’t want, we can allow them to "
cease.  But there are some parts of us that we do n
"ot want to give up, that we do not "
"want to cease, that we do not want to disappear.  T"
his is where attachment and 
186
clinging stops us from experiencing the fruits of c
essation and understanding its 
meaning as an experience. 
One of the insights that are most likely after a 
jhana
 experience is the insight into the 
meaning of 

", because this is one’s first experience of anythin"
g absolutely 
vanishing and completely ceasing.  The five senses 
"that were there once are now, for a "
"long period of time, no longer there.  In the simil"
e that I have given before about the 
"television set, it’s not just the program changing,"
 it’s the whole television set – which 
has been there as long as you can remember – disapp
earing.  All you see are the 
"programs on the screen, changing.  Now for the firs"
t time in your memory the whole 
television set has completely vanished.  It’s compl
"etely gone, it is "

.  The very 
possibility of that was completely beyond you; you 
couldn’t even conceive of that 
happening.  But after a 
jhana
 you know it has happened:  you’ve been there and 
you’ve experienced the profoundness of cessation.  
That which was once impossible 
you have experienced.  You’ve seen the five senses 
gone; you’ve seen the ‘doer’ 
gone. 
In 
the 
second 
jhana
you’re 
"completely, "

"(intention) is possible, no control at all.  The mi"

you cannot conceive of.  You cannot even imagine it
. 
Those 
jhana
" states are weird, and that is why people who haven"
’t had any experience 
of them they always fall flat on their faces when t
hey try to explain them.  They 
haven’t got a clue what those things are.  Once tho
se states are experienced for what 
"they truly are, then you can really see that someth"
"ing very big has gone, especially the "
going of the ‘doer’.  The ‘doer’ has been most of w
hat you thought you were.  That’s 
what we call the ‘house builder’ in Buddhism.  It’s
" one of the biggest causes, if not "
the
 cause of rebirth.  It’s what keeps 

" going – always building new houses, "
"new tasks, new things to do – It makes the wheel go"
 around.  You see that ‘doing’ has 
"completely, absolutely gone.  You’re just sitting t"
"here absolutely still, frozen, no "
‘doer’.  Because there is no ‘doer’ that’s the reas
on there’s no movement – I really 
mean no movement – just one mind object for a long 
period of time without even a 
"wobble or a shake, but life is still there .  Once "
that is experienced and you emerge 
"afterwards, "
you’ve 
seen 
something 
that 
you 
thought 
impossible: 
an 
absolute 
disappearing and going to cessation.  That which yo
u thought was an absolute you 
187
"realise is impermanent, and it can fade and actuall"
y end in peace.  Once you can admit 
the possibility of such cessation then you can unde
rstand 
Metta
.  There is nothing 
substantial here because you know it can cease abso
"lutely, completely.  There is "
nothing 
remaining 
"whatsoever, "
not 
even 
a 
cosmic 
or 
un-manifest 
consciousness.  
Cessation is cessation is cessation.  If there was 
something left it wouldn’t be called 
cessation. 
Once 
you 
can 
see 
that 
from 
your 
own 
experience 
it 
g
ives 
you 
the 
fuel 
for 
the 
"experience of Stream Winning, it gives you the seed"
.  Cessation has happened and 
you can start to understand that what you took to b
"e self, what you took to be me, "
"what you took to be mine, is subject to cessation, "
it is 

.  You now 
know what 

 means.  You know it applies to all the five senses
", you know it "
"applies to will, and it’s only a small step to know"
 that it applies to consciousness as 
"well.  That which you thought was you, the ‘one who"
" knows’, ceases.  It goes "
completely without any remainder.  When you see tha
t degree of 

 you have 
the opportunity to experience the Enlightenment exp
eriences.  You see the path of 
"inclining towards cessation, not towards building u"
"p more things, more possessions, "
more 
"thoughts, "
or 
more 
attainment’s. 
Allow 
everyth
ing 
to 
cease 
by 
giving 
"up, "
"relinquishing, and letting go.  You see how little "
one can live with.  You see how few 
thoughts one can keep in one’s mind.  You see how l
"ittle one can sleep, how little one "
"can eat, how little one need talk, how little one n"

"for it, is "
	

ng course of 
action.  In the tenth 
$&#
" it is ceasing to cause a schism, in the eleventh g"
iving 
"up support for a schism, in the twelfth giving up t"
"he refusal to be admonished, and in "
188
the thirteenth giving up the criticism of the act o
f banishment.  The same word 
	&&
" is giving up views, ways of using the mind, though"
"ts, perceptions.  It’s "
abandoning on that level; it’s not so much giving u
"p material things such as your robe, "
"your sugar, or worldly possessions, or for a layper"
"son your money, car, etc..  This is "
giving up on the very deepest levels of cognition. 
 We can give away many things in 
this life but what we find it hard to give up are t
hose things that we call our mental 
"possessions – our pride, our sense of self, our kno"
"wledge, and our sense of being "
"someone who no one else can tread on, all those sen"
ses of an ‘I’.  That’s what we find 
hard to abandon.  But it has to be abandoned if one
 wishes to become Enlightened.  
The sense of self with all its ramifications – the 
"stupidity, pride, and pain – creates "
more fire that burns you inside.  It’s called 
"dukkha"
. 
"Please don’t buy into all of that, allow it to fade"
", to cease.  See if you can give up all "
"of the aspects of self-view, so that when you do th"
e reflection on 
	&&
 it’s not 
"the worldly material things that you are giving up,"
 it’s the things of the mind.  You’re 
"abandoning, giving away, letting go of your past an"
d future.  In the 
$&#

a monk is asked in front of the 
$&
" three times to give something up, give that up, "
"give that up, if you don’t you incur the offence of"
$&#
.  The Buddha is 
asking you to give up your sense of past and future
", and if you don’t give it up you get "
"suffering.  Give up your thinking, your thoughts; o"
therwise you get headaches.  Give 
"up all of your sense of control:  of me and mine, m"
"y ideas, my rights, my will, my "
"mind, and my plans – see if you can apply "
	&&
 to those.  Have the courage 
and see what happens.  What happens is that you bec
ome peaceful.  These things are 
"the stuff of fetters, the stuff of defilements, the"
 stuff of craving.  When you see that 
through contemplating 
	&&
" you are abandoning not just the outside world, "
you are abandoning the inside world.  If you develo
p that 
	&&
 perception 
throughout the practice of meditation you’ll find t
hat meditation gets so easy.  In the 
/

"

 (SN. XLVIII. 9) there is a word that is very close
 to

f you develop that mind of

 easily. 
%	&&
", the perception of abandoning the inner thoughts, "
the inner ideas and the 
"inner illusions, is a beautiful fast track to the d"
eep meditations.  See how much you 
189
"can give up, especially your ideas, your thoughts, "
and even some of the ways that you 
perceive.  If you can do that you are applying the 
contemplation of 
	&&
 to 
developing deep meditation.  After deep meditation 
contemplate 
	&&
 even 
further.  You’re abandoning all of those mental def
"ilements:  cravings, wrong views, "
"wrong perceptions, and the wrong thoughts called th"
e

"cognition, what we call "

"them up, you’re allowing them to cease until there’"
s nothing there.  If you can do that 
"you can get on the path to deep insights, and you f"
ind that you can give up everything 
because there is 
nothing there anyway.  There’s not
"hing to keep, "
nothing worth 
"holding on to.  As the Lord Buddha said, "
!!#

 
!#
 (MN 
"37), that’s beautiful.  Again for those who know "
Pali
 there is a related word

"means lodging, or an abiding.  I like to translate "

"as:  all, everything completely, is not worth hangi"
"ng out in, not worth making an "
"abiding in, not worth making a home for the conscio"
usness or for the ‘doer’.  It’s 
usually 
translated 
as 
‘nothing

attaching

which 
misses 
most 
of 
the 
meaning.  When you understand the idea of 

" as a place where you abide, live, "
"and create a home, and then you understand the full"
 meaning and you understand why 
you 
can 
actually 
abandon 
everything. 
You 
understan
d 
why 
	&&
", "
the 
"abandoning of wrong thoughts, wrong views, wrong th"

. 
Conclusion 
So these are ways of using those four reflections a
t the end of the 

"Sutta"
", "

", "
&
", "

", and "
	&&
.  When the Buddha taught those reflections 
"he meant them to be done extremely deeply, extremel"
"y beautifully, very powerfully, "
and very wonderfully.  Unless you are an 

 never think that you understand 
these words completely.  That’s why it’s good to al
low them to roll around in the 
"mind, allow the mind to play around with them, allo"
w the mind to recognise them.  
"There may have been experiences in the past, in the"
" long distant past, when you knew "
those words.  They can resonate now and take you to
" the same territory, the territory "
of the 
jhanas
", the territory of "
&& 
"(The Path and Fruit), the territory of peace.  "
So play with those words especially after a deep me
ditation.  They can lead you into 
jhanas
; they can lead you into complete release

13  THE OUTFLOWINGS OF THE MIND 
12
th
 September 2000 
When you go outside at this time of the year the fu
ll moon is very close.  It’s the 
second full moon of the rains retreat.  Two months 
have passed since the start of the 
retreat and the mind should have slowed down by now
.  A lot of business has been got 
out of the way.  Because of the continuous inclinat
ion of the mind towards peaceful 
states there should now be some experience of those
 peaceful states. 
The Endless Task 
The inclination of the mind is all-important.  Very
 often the mind inclines in the 
wrong direction.  It goes out into the world of sig
"hts, sounds, smells, tastes, and "
touches.  It even goes to thoughts about those expe
"riences, to what we call the echoes "
of worldly life that happen in the thinking mind:  
"dreams, fantasies and memories.  "
With all of these we are observing the things of th
"e world.  In contrast, the inclination "
of the mind inwards is the way to develop the ‘lett
ing go’ of the world.  When we talk 
about the ‘letting go’ or the ‘fading away’ of the 
"world, we can look at that from "
many different aspects.  We understand how the incl
ination of the mind inwards 
brings the mind into a focus. 
The inclination of the mind outwards is called 
*
 in 
Pali
.  There are so many 
different things to do and so many different object
s to pay attention to.  It’s the world 
of endless busyness.  There’s no end to that prolif
eration or the complexity of that 
world of 
*
".  On the other hand, the mind that inclines inward"
s into the present 
"moment, the silence, the breath, the "
Citta
", and the "
jhanas
", is the mind which "
knows the end of 
*
".  The mind can know the end of proliferation, the "
end of 
"busyness, and the end of complexity, as it gets clo"
"ser to unity, to oneness. "
The inclination of the mind inwards is one of the p
erceptions that can be developed in 
this monastery.  Whenever you catch the mind going 
outwards it is a manifestation of 
what in the 
Dhamma
 we call the 
asava
", the out-flowings of the mind.  The "
asava
come from the mind and go out to explore the world.
  That ‘going out’ to explore the 
world 
is 
where 
we 
get 
caught 
in 

; 
always 
wanting 
to 
experience 
new 
191
sensations and new delights.  Very often people in 
the world find that no matter where 
they 
"travel, "
no 
matter 
where 
they 
"go, "
or 
what 
they 
"experience, "
there 
is 
always 
"something more.  So it’s an endless task, an endles"
"s journey, if one follows the "
"journey by going outwards into the world.  However,"
 by noticing that movement of 
the 
mind 
that 
goes 
outwards 
rather 
than 
"inwards, "
on
e can 
know for oneself 
the 
meaning of this term 
asava
 in Buddhism. 
The Trouble Makers 
The Buddha taught three 
asava
:  
kamasva
", "
bhavasava
", and "
avijjassava
.  
)asava
is 
the mind that goes out to the world of the five sen
"ses, or to their echoes in the mind, "
"playing around, trying to find sustenance, trying t"
o find satisfaction.  Anyone with an 
ounce of wisdom should be able to know by now that 
no matter where you go in that 
"world, there can never be satisfaction.  There can "
never be peace.  You can never be 
full of contentment.  The very powerful simile that
 the Buddha gave for the world of 
the senses is that the world is forever burning; it
 promises so much but never gives 
you what it promises. 
There is also the simile of the dog that is thrown 
a bone covered with blood.  It’s got 
"the taste of food, the smell of food, but that bone"
 smeared with blood cannot satisfy 
"the dog’s hunger.  It tastes nice, it looks good, b"
"ut in the end the dog is hungry, "
perhaps even more hungry and disappointed than it w
as at the beginning.  And so it is 
with the sensory pleasures.  The Buddha said sensor
y pleasures give you a little 
"happiness, but a lot of dissatisfaction, a lot of t"
"rouble, and a lot of turmoil. "
"So, you should know that the "
asava
 that go out to play with the world of the five 
senses are troublemakers.  They are things that tak
e away the peace and contentment 
of the mind.  The mind will never reach the goal be
cause basically it is going in the 
wrong direction. 
.asava
 goes out into the world just to prove existence.  
"To justify existence, we "
"have to do something, make something, and be somebo"
dy.  If you ever find yourself 
going out into the world for that reason you should
 understand that it is another 

sava
", "
"another out-flowing, which takes you away from the "
"core, away from truth, and away "
192
from peace.  The will ‘to be’ is a form of 
*
 that creates much turmoil and many 
problems in our world.  It takes you out to try and
 achieve some fame or status.  It 
makes you defend yourself when you think that other
 people are criticising you.  
These are all the movements of the mind that try to
 say ‘I am’.  
.asava
", is taking "
you in the wrong direction.  It’s affirming existen
"ce, affirming being, rather than "
going in the opposite direction of ‘letting go’. 
With
and 
avijjassava
 the mind goes out because of delusion.  It’s stupi
d to want to go 
out into the world.  How much do you need in this w
orld?  Sometimes as the abbot of 
a monastery I have to be very careful because if mo
st of the monks in the monastery 
are 
"

"
", it’s so easy for them to want more and more, whet"
"her it’s heaters, "
"coolers, or walking meditation paths.  For example,"
" sooner or later, when we have "
"roads through the monastery, we might even be able "
to have meals on wheels and take 
the food to each monk’s hut.  Then you would only h
ave to come outside to put your 
bowl out.  You wouldn’t even need to come to the 
 
(hall).  We could have a P.A. 
"system for the chanting, so that you could chant "
"
"
 into a microphone and all 
"the lay people could hear you.  Whatever it is, "
*
" can do this endlessly, but it "
misses the point.  The point is that trying to make
" everything comfortable, stable, and "
easy is just the mind going out into the world. 
The Present Moment 
"It’s so easy to make plans in the mind, to plan the"
" perfect monastery, the perfect hut.  "
"It is so easy to plan the perfect hermitage, but th"
"at is going out into the world, that’s "
kamasva
".  It’s much better in a monastery such as this, wh"
ich is comfortable enough 
"as it is, to go into your hut as much as you can.  "
You go into the hut and into 
simplicity.  The Buddha taught 
"
		"
 as part of the gradual training.  It means 
"contentment with little, contentment with what you "
have.  It doesn’t matter if it’s the 
best; it’s good enough.  What’s the purpose of the 
food?  What’s the purpose of the 
hut?  What’s the purpose of all your requisites?  T
he purpose is not to win an award 
for the best monastery in the world.  The purpose o
f all this is not to have tourists 
coming around and saying how beautiful the monaster
"y is, or how wonderful your hut "
is.  The purpose of these requisites is to give you
 the opportunity to let go by 
"providing the basic needs of the body, so that you "
don’t need to be so concerned with 
193
all that goes on outside.  The whole purpose of a m
onastery such as this is to try and 
lessen the busyness of the world. 
By following the 
asava
 into the world we make more busyness for others an
d for 
ourselves.  But we can lessen that busyness by sayi
"ng, ‘this is good enough’.  Your "
hut is good enough.  The monastery is good enough a
nd the walking path is good 
"enough.  Sure, it could be better but it’s good eno"
ugh.  Doing that takes away a lot of 
the busyness in our lives.  Sometimes we need to sa
"y, ‘this day is good enough’.  For "
those of you who are planning to leave this monaste
"ry after the rains retreat, you "
haven’t left yet.  That’s in the far distant future
.  You may never leave.  You may die 
in this monastery.  All those plans and the mind go
ing off into the future are a great 
waste of time.  It is wasting the opportunity to pr
"actise today, because you are busy "
planning for tomorrow. 
"Often we do not have enough time in our lives, but "
the reason why people haven’t 
enough time is because they throw time away.  The w
ay of practice in a monastery is 
to do walking meditation and sitting meditation mos
"t of the time.  When walking, "
don’t waste the time by thinking of things that don
’t really concern you.  I’m talking 
here about the thoughts of tomorrow or the next day
.  Even thoughts of later on in the 
evening don’t really concern you.  The only thing t
hat concerns you is the present 
moment and what’s happening now.  Try and go into t
hat present moment more and 
more. 
People 
have 
sometimes 
told 
me 
that 
they 
have 
a 
prob
lem 
with 
present 
moment 
awareness.  They are not quite sure what they shoul
"d be aware of, what they should be "
"focussing on, or what they should be doing.  It’s j"
ust a matter of being acquainted 
with what that present moment really is.  Once you 
make a good acquaintance with 
the present moment it’s easy to focus on it.  If yo
"u’re not quite sure what it is, or you "
"feel uncomfortable, then of course it will be diffi"
cult. 
Notice that the 
asava
" that flow out of the mind, away from the ‘here and"
" now’, "
"always seeking for something else, are a force in t"
"he mind, a movement of the mind.  "
"You can ask the question, ‘Why does my mind want to"
" flee from the present moment, "
"from what it has right now, from this?  Why does my"
 mind want to go fleeing off into 
194
"the future, to fantasies, to the past, or to dreams"
?  Why does it want to do this?  
What’s wrong with this present moment?’   That whic
h is going out doesn’t even 
know what the present moment is.  You see that the 
mind is not looking in the right 
direction.  It’s not looking inwards at what’s here
.  The mind is looking outwards to 
what might be.  That’s called craving and craving i
s always blind.  It’s blind to what 
you have and it only sees what’s missing or what yo
u might have in the future.  That’s 
the delusive part of craving. 
Ill will is the same.  When you’re angry with someo
ne you do not realise what your 
mind is like.  You are just worrying about the thin
g or the person over there.  The 
mind is going out.  It forgets what’s inside.  A ve
ry effective and beautiful way to stop 
that type of outgoing mind is to notice the movemen
"t, the flow of consciousness out "
"into the world, onto the person or the object of yo"
ur anger.  Notice the mind going out 
"to the future, to the past, into fantasies and drea"
"ms, and the world of thoughts.  You "
"will realise you’ve missed the point, the point of "
"the ‘now’, the inner point of the "
mind.  As soon as you recognise that movement of th
"e mind, it is quiet easy to turn "
that 
current 
of 
consciousness 
around. 
Instead 
of 
g
oing 
out 
into 
the 
world 
and 
searching and reaching out you can turn the mind in
wards. 
Going Against the Stream 
What is doing the reaching out?  What’s hearing?  W
hat’s feeling?  What’s seeing?  
"What is it that’s saying, thinking, and doing?  To "
find that out you have to go inwards.  
In P

li the word for wise attention is 


; it literally means the work of 
the mind that goes to the source.  The 

" is the womb, the origin.  It doesn’t go out "
into the world; it goes in where this world is comi
ng from or where this mind is 
coming from.  The mind is similar to a soldier figh
ting the enemies of craving and 
desire.  Where does all of this actually come from?
5

 goes in the 
opposite direction to the 
asava
".  It goes against the stream, against the flow of "
the 
world.  That’s the reason why the metaphor of going
 against the stream is a very 
common one in the 
Dhamma
 taught by the Lord Buddha. 
The Buddha taught us to go against the stream of cr
"aving, against the "

savas
", against "
"the movement of the mind to the sensory world, and "
"the world of being, and instead to "
195
"go inwards, in the opposite direction.  It takes a "
lot of training to be able to do that.  
That is the training in the five 
Indriyas
", especially the first "

", confidence and "
"faith, "

".  Confidence and faith also means having patience,"
" giving it time, giving "
it all the time it needs.  If you read the 
(#&

"monks, "
for

"Anuruddha, "
spent 
"many, "

at the Buddha taught is true.  
If you have confidence that there are 
Ariyas
" in the world, and you have confidence in "
"them, then you know that if you practise the Eightf"
old Path it leads to 
!!
.  If 
"you’re practising the Eightfold Path, and following"
" the instructions, you know where "
it leads.  It’s only a matter of time. 
"It’s not up to you.  It’s a process, a condition, c"
ause and effect.  It’s wonderful when 
you realize 
Metta
 (no-self) and realize that it’s not up to the pers
on.  It’s just a process 
independent of any ego or any self.  So whether you
" say, “I can’t do it”, “I can do it”, "
"“I’m up to it”, “I’m not up to it”, the ‘I’ doesn’t"
" come into it.  It’s a process, that’s all.  "
"All the conditions are here for you, so it’s only a"
 matter of time.  Having that sort of 
"confidence, having that sort of faith, is what powe"
"rs the mind to go against the stream, "
"against the out-flowings, and instead go inwards. "
The Russian Dolls 
The tendency of people is to go out into the world.
  When any problem arises in their 
"practice or their meditation, they blame something "
"outside of themselves, like the "
"teacher, the monastery, this monk, that "
&
", the food, the climate, or even their "
bodies.  That’s just going out into the world again
".  Don’t go out into the world, "
instead go inside.  One can always go ‘in’ no matte
r what the problem or difficulty is.  
Don’t go out to the problem.  Go against the stream
", "


", go inwards.  "
What is experiencing the problem?  What is making t
his decision?  What is this 
‘doer’?  What is this ‘knower’?  Going inside is go
ing in the right direction and you 
should understand that the going inwards is precise
ly the path of meditation which is 
196
"taught here.  Going into the present moment, going "
"into the silence, which is right in "
the centre of the present moment. 
"If you’re clearly, perfectly present you haven’t th"
e time to say anything.  All speech is 
about what has just happened or about what might ha
ppen next.  You can’t say 
"anything about what’s happening now.  So, to gain t"
"hat silence, I just cultivate present "
"moment awareness, cultivating it and refining it un"
til it becomes silent.  Silence just 
arises right in the centre of ‘present moment aware
ness’ and that silence is like a huge 
room into which I invite the breath.  I don’t go ou
t to the breath.  That again is an 
ā
sava
; a movement of the mind.  If you go out to the bre
"ath, you’ll find the breath is "
uncomfortable and difficult to perceive.  If you ca
n make the mind go inwards to the 
"present moment, inwards into the silence, and then "
invite the breath in you’ll find the 
breath will come in by itself.  It’ll be in the roo
m of silence.  You’re actually going 
into the centre of that silent room where the breat
h lives. 
"With each of these stages of meditation, the next s"
tage arises from the very centre of 
the stage you are in now.  You don’t need to go on 
to something else.  You don’t need 
to get rid of this experience now.  You don’t need 
to suppress the 
asava
 or encourage 
"the mind to go onto the next stage, ‘Come on, go qu"
"icker, achieve more, come on, go "
on’.  That’s the wrong direction.  Go inwards with 
no craving and no desire for 
"something else.  Just develop contentment, letting "
"go as you go inwards, into the "
"breath, not out to the breath. "
"If you have that inclination to go inwards, that wh"
ich is experiencing the breath gets 
closer to the centre.  You’re letting go of this ex
ternal outward shell of existence.  
You’re letting go of the body.  You’ve already let 
go of the world outside.  Imagine 
"this inner world as a series of concentric shells, "
"like the famous Russian dolls, one "
inside of the other.  You have the world outside an
d in the middle of that is your body.  
Get rid of the body and in the middle of that is th
e breath.  In the middle of the breath 
is the 
Citta
.  All we are doing is going inwards.  So if any of
 you have had 
"trouble, wondering what to do when you’re concentra"
"ted on the breath, just nudge the "
mind inwards a little more.  Direct the mind inward
"s, into this experience, inwards "
"into this moment, further into the silence, further"
 into the breath.  When you really get 
into that a lot of pleasure and happiness arise.  I
t’s just the pleasure and happiness that 
197
arise with the release of that world outside.  It i
s happiness that arises from the release 
of this body and the five senses.  You have to go r
ight inside this body to find that 
release.  You won’t find it outside. 
Once you’ve trained yourself in the direction of al
"ways going inward, looking inward, "
"going into your hut, into your meditation, into the"
" moment, into the silence, into the "
"breath, you very easily get into the ‘beautiful bre"
ath’.  It’s natural to have this happen 
"when you’re going in the correct direction.  If, wh"
"en you get to the breath, you’re "
neither going inwards nor outwards but just staying
" with that breath, it won’t develop "
anymore.  So try and go inwards to the present mome
"nt, closer to the silence.   With "
the mind going inwards you soon get to the ‘beautif
ul breath’.  It’s only a matter of 
time before you go right into the centre of that be
autiful breath.  The breath is like one 
"of those soft centred chocolates:  the sweet part, "
"the happiness of the breath, lies right "
"in the centre of it.  As you go to the centre, the "
breath disappears.  The simile that I 
give 
in 
meditation 
retreats 
is 
the 
one 
about 
medita
tors 
being 
tested 
for 
their 
concentration by having to shoot an arrow through t
he eye of a stuffed bird.  The last 
"student is being asked by the meditation master, “C"
an you see the bird in the tree?”  
“What tree?” 
“Can you see the bird?” 
“What bird?” 
“What can you see then?” 
“I can only see one eyeball.” 
He’d focussed so much inwards that all he could see
", his only field of perception, was "
the target. 
Now you can go even further inwards.  By being with
" the ‘beautiful breath’, go into "
the beauty.  The beauty is 
"
"
.  You can’t stop there; you have to go right into 
the 
"
"
", falling inwards.  That’s the experience of many p"
eople who get a 
Citta
 and then enter a 
jhana
.  You fall into the centre of the beautiful light 
of the 
Citta
", letting it embrace and go all around you, staying"
" there, and even going "
"deeper.  You are always inclining inwards, until yo"
u go through all the 
jhanas
.
  You 
go so far in that you get to the very heart of thin
"gs, to cessation.  Then you will know "
198
that the core of all this is ‘emptiness’.  There is
" no ‘self’, there is no ‘doer’, and there "
is no ‘knower’.  There is only empty phenomena roll
ing along. 
Know the Truth 
"Going right inwards, you get insight.  You don’t ge"
t insights in the realm of the five 
senses and the world outside.  You don’t get insigh
ts by just watching the breath.  
You get insights when you see deeply into the very 
"heart, the very centre of all of this.  "
One inclines deeper and sees the beautiful cessatio
"n, which is a wonderful experience.  "
People in the world are afraid of cessation because
" they think of it as destruction, as "
"annihilation, not understanding or appreciating its"
 beauty.  That’s the reason some 
"people in the world, if they have only a little und"
"erstanding of Buddhism, think of it "
as like suicide or death.  But those people who hav
e practised the path and know the 
"truth, know that as one gets deeper and deeper, mor"
"e profundity, joy, and happiness "
are experienced. 
The 
asava
 cause 
"dukkha"
.  They are 
"dukkha"
.  They are suffering.  They are going out 
into the world making busyness for you.  It’s like 
"going out into a fire, into a storm, or "
into the cold and the wind and the rain.  It’s goin
g out from the cosy comfortable 
place within yourself.  The more you can go inwards
", the more happiness you will "
"feel, and that gives you a marvellous understanding"
 of the power of the Four Noble 
Truths and how deep their meaning is.  The deeper o
"ne goes inwards, and the more "
one goes against the 
asava
", the more happiness and pleasure one experiences, "
and the 
more one will be inclined to go deeper and deeper o
n the path of ever increasing 
happiness.  After a while it is not a path of strug
gle or a path which requires much 
"effort, because the inclination to go deeper become"
s a causal process and is self-
sustaining. 
One goes inwards more and more deeply just for the 
"happiness of it, for the sheer "
profundity of it.  Each one of you who’ve gone deep
" inside, gone against the "
asava
", "
"know that the deeper you’ve gone the more peaceful,"
" joyful, and more profound the "
experience is.  You’ve come closer to truth and wis
dom.  You know that is the path.  
"There is some insight, some wisdom in the mind, tha"
t knows that that’s the way to go.  
It is 


", the mind working to go deeper and deeper inwards."
  Cultivate 
199
that.  Incline towards that.  Don’t cultivate and i
ncline towards the world outside.  So 
many people have done that and just wasted their ti
"me.  Cultivate the inner yearning, "
"the inner abidings, and the movement of the mind ag"
ainst the 
asava
.  When you go 
"that deep, and find there’s nothing there, you will"
 have cut off the very root of the 

savas
 and also the reason why you go out into the world.
  You will have cut off the 
avijjassava
", the cause of the out-flowings, the illusion of a "
‘self’ – the ‘me’ that has to 
"do something in this world, engage with the world, "
and justify its existence in the 
world by ‘doing’ and ‘achieving’.  When you can cut
 that off then the mind will 
always incline against the world and go inwards. 
So remember the meaning of the 
asava
.  Understand them as movements of the mind 
which go out into the world.  Notice when those 
asava
 are there in your mind.  See if 
you can counteract them by developing and training 
yourself to be a person who 
"inclines inwards, into more solitude, into more sec"
"lusion, into the present moment, "
"into the subtle breath, into more silence, into mor"
"e bliss, into emptiness. "
Cut off those 
asava
 and then you’ll be free.

14  STARVING THE TIGER TO DEATH 
Overcoming the Defilements 
1
st 
November 2000 
It doesn’t matter what time of the year it is – bef
"ore, after, or during the rains retreat – "
you should always remember that we are here for one
 reason only:  to end suffering 
and to find the truth that the Buddha sought.  We s
hould all have enough faith to 
realise that this is only done by training the mind
.  Especially by training the mind 
"firstly to know, and then to weaken and fully overc"
"ome, what the Buddha called the "
 #
", the defilements of the mind. "
The Guardian of the Mind 
If I think back in time and remember the teachings 
"of Ajahn Chah, Ajahn Mah"
ā
"Boowa, and all the other great forest monks in the "
"North East of Thailand, I recall that "
in every talk they spoke about the 
 #
" and how much they affect human beings, "
"creating suffering again and again – immediately, l"
"ater on, and in the next life.  So as "
"monks, instead of getting high over the finer aspec"
ts of the 
Dhamma
 and talking about 
"emptiness, "
jhanas
", "
Dependent 
"Origination, "
and 
non-manifest 
conscious
"ness, "
or 
"whatever, it’s good to bring yourself back to reali"
ty and look at the 
 #
 in your 
mind. 
The biggest of the 
 #
 are 
 !
", "

", and "

","
" which can be translated as greed, "
"hatred, and delusion.  Delusion is the mind which t"
hinks it’s doing something right 
"but is actually doing something wrong.  That is, it"
" encourages more defilements, "
"which encourages more heat in the mind, and that is"
 not conducive to the path.  It 
doesn’t lead to liberation and it doesn’t lead to o
ther people having faith in what you 
are doing. 
The 
only 
thing 
that 
can 
really 
oppose 
that 
delusion
is 
a 
sense 
of 
""""
accompanied by mindfulness.  
""""
 is the sense of shame.  The shame of 
"doing something that is inappropriate, knowing that"
 it is going to create suffering for 
201
you and for others.  Just look at what you are doin
"g and why you are doing it, and "
"consider if it is the sort of thing that a monk, a "
disciple of the Buddha should be 
doing?  Is this something that a novice should be d
oing?  Is this something that an 
&
 or even a visitor to the monastery should be doing
?  Is it something that 
you
"should be doing?  If someone saw you doing this, wh"
at would they say?  How would 
they look at it? 
To practice 
""""
 means your morality has to be good.  Your ethics a
nd your 
monastic precepts have to be so good that even if y
ou had a video camera following 
"you around for twenty-four hours a day, it would ne"
ver find anything in your conduct 
which would cause you a sense of shame.  It would n
ever even find anything in your 
mind that lay-people would find fault with.  It mea
ns that if you could take out all the 
thoughts and the moods of the mind so that you coul
d show them to your fellow 
"monastics, you wouldn’t be ashamed of them.  That’s"
 the training you should be 
doing.  
""""
 should be fully developed because it is the guardi
an for your 
conduct. 
Your position as a monk is not just for your own li
"beration, it’s also for inspiring faith "
in others.  I take that extremely seriously as a te
acher and especially in my position as 
an abbot.  I’ve seen so many monks in whom I had fa
"ith for awhile, who I thought "
"were doing marvellous things, giving wonderful talk"
"s, and then they misbehaved.  "
That really hurt me quite badly.  If it was not for
 the fact that I have enormous faith in 
the 
Dhamma
 I probably wouldn’t have even managed to become a 
"monk, because "
those monks were saying one thing and doing another
.  So there was a hypocrisy 
"there, "
which 
really 
hurt 
me. 
Unfortunately 
that 
ha
s 
often 
happened in 
Western 
countries. 
When 
a 
monk 
goes 
around 
talking 
about 
the 
restraint
of 
the 
"senses, "
"simplicity, "
"frugality, and meditation, but then does the opposi"
"te, it hurts people who see it.  What "
would his friends in the holy life and the people w
ho support him say?  That sense of 
shame should hurt the monk as well.  When you devel
op this sense of shame there are 
some things which just don’t feel right.  You know 
"they are wrong, you know they are "
202
inappropriate for a monk to be doing.  With a stron
g sense of 
""""
 you’ve got a 
chance of fighting these defilements of the mind.  
If your 
""""
 is very weak 
you won’t have a feeling for what monastic life is 
about. 
Clearing Away the Distractions 
Forest monasteries have changed from the time when 
I was a young monk.  For 
"example, we were just talking this evening about th"
e fact that some of the quite 
"remote forest monasteries, that are close enough to"
" Bangkok, get enormous amounts "
of drinks and all sorts of edibles for the afternoo
"ns.  Someone asked me, ‘What did "
you have on the drink tray when you first became a 
monk?’  
I answered quite 
"accurately, ‘There wasn’t a drink tray’.  When I fi"
rst went to Wat Pah Pong – this was 
before Wat Pah Nanachat was started – it was a long
 time before we had anything to 
drink in the afternoons.  It was months before I ev
en saw a bag of sugar and there 
wasn’t any coffee.  I remember once a visitor came 
and gave a small jar of coffee to 
one of the novice monks; it was the first time we h
ad seen anything like that in 
months.  That was what the forest tradition was lik
e. 
That sort of simplicity and frugality is encouraged
 for a purpose.  It is to clear away as 
many distractions as possible so that you have a ch
ance to see the mind and to 
"understand, reduce, and overcome the defilements.  "
Unfortunately sometimes even in 
this monastery some people seem intent on making mo
re distractions and as a result 
they give me more to do.  There needs to be a sense
 of 
hiri-ottappa
.  The Buddha 
once said to 
0 
", ‘Whatever certainly leads to "
!!
", to the turning away from the "
"world of the senses, to the fading away of the worl"
"d of the six senses, that is the "
Dhamma’.  These are words that guide me in my monas
tic life; Words that tell me 
what I should be doing and what I shouldn’t be doin
g.  They tell me what’s 
Dhamma
and what isn’t 
Dhamma
".  It’s Dhamma if it leads to cessation, the ending"
" of things, "
and that beautiful emptiness that comes with the en
ding of things. 
The ending of things leads to 
"
2"
" the settling down of the mind, to peace, quiet, "
and silence.  
!
 is Enlightenment wisdom.  
!!
 is the complete going out 
203
"of this flame of doing, the end of being concerned "
and interested in playing around in 
that world.  If what you are doing leads to those t
"hings, if it’s pointing in those "
"directions, then you can know that this is the "
Dhamma
", this is the "
+
","
 and this is 
the teaching of the Buddha. 
"I heard of a nun who went on a very long retreat, a"
nd then when she came off the 
retreat she started listening to music.  I thought 
"‘hang on, what are you doing?’  That’s "
just looking for delight in the five senses.  That’
s not something that leads to 
!!
", "
"to turning away, to fading away.  It doesn’t lead t"
"o cessation, it doesn’t lead to the "
"quieter states of mind, and it doesn’t lead to "
!!
","
 to Enlightenment.  It goes in the 
wrong direction.  The Buddha’s advice to 
0 
 – who was originally a barber – was 
enough for him to know what was appropriate and wha
t was not appropriate for a 
monk to do.  It gave him guidelines to develop 


 and he became an 

", "
as well as a 
+
 expert. 
So 
we 
look 
at 
these 
teachings 
and 
use 
them 
to 
overc
ome 
the 
delusion 
and 
the 
misunderstanding 
about 
what 
we 
are 
supposed 
to 
be 
d
oing 
and 
then 
we 
can 
understand what the 
Dhamma
 is and who’s teaching correct 
Dhamma
.  Using the 
standard that the Buddha gave 
0 
 – which he also gave to 
'
p

1
the first 
".
"
 – is extremely powerful and it shows us what these
 #
 really 
are.  Keep it in mind and follow it.  Once you have
 the idea of following the Buddha’s 
"teachings to overcome the coarser part of delusion,"
 it becomes much harder for you to 
justify acts of greed and anger.  Often you see peo
ple in the world who have these 
"defilements of hatred, ill will, and sensory desire"
", and they keep justifying them all the "
"time.  They say, ‘It’s good to get angry’, or ‘They"
" need to be told’ and, ‘It’s good to "
have fun now and again and to enjoy this and enjoy 
that’.  It gets to the point that 
people claim “It’s the ‘kitchen sink path to Enligh
tenment.  You don’t need to be a 
"monk or a nun; you can just be in the world, enjoy "
your family and your job and 
"become Enlightened”.  As they say in English, that’"
s just trying to ‘have your cake 
and eat it too’.  Once you’ve eaten your cake it’s 
"gone, it’s disappeared; you can’t eat "
your cake and keep it at the same time.  You’ve got
 a choice: to preserve it for later on 
or eat it now.  You can’t have it both ways. 
204
When a person really understands what the Buddha wa
"s talking about, when they "
understand that there is a way to overcome the defi
lements of the mind and to become 
"Enlightened, then they won’t waste time with the "
 #
.  The defilements stop you 
"from enjoying peace of mind, and they stop you enjo"
ying the liberation of the mind.  
They prevent wisdom from arising and you just get s
tuck in 

" for many, many "
more lifetimes.  So we’ve got to do something about
 these defilements and not just 
allow them to be.  Don’t justify them.  Know very c
learly that the Buddha said that 
sensory desire is defilement
.  
Sensory desire is pursuing enjoyment in the realm o
f 
"sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch.  That is not"
 part of the middle way. 
When the Buddha taught the middle way between the t
"wo extremes, the first extreme "
was 
"kama
  
&"
.  Here 
"
&"
" means attachment, getting into, pursuing, "
or having a lot to do with.  
")
"
" is the happiness of the five senses, including "
"sexuality, food, and entertainment.  And that’s cer"
tainly not the middle way: the 
Buddha said that it doesn’t lead to 
!!
; it leads to more 
"dukkha"
","
 more suffering.  
I always have to quote the Buddha because I’m just 
"a monk, just Ajahn Brahm.  Who "
"will believe me if I say these things?  So, I quote"
 from the sources and that gives what 
I am saying a bit more authority.  I think many of 
you have heard the great teachers of 
our tradition say the same things.  That’s why as d
"isciples of the forest tradition, you "
"should always keep in mind Ajahn Chah, and Ajahn Ta"
te. These are the monks I 
knew.  What do they say?  What did they do?  How wo
uld they act?  Asking those 
questions keeps me in line.  If ever I were about t
"o do something I was not sure about, "
"I would think, ‘Well what would Ajahn Chah do?  Wha"
t would Ajahn Tate do?’  I 
was around those monks – especially Ajahn Chah – fo
r long enough.  I knew what 
they would do and how they would do it.  If it was 
"something they would never do, "
then I don’t want to do it either.  That’s a sort o
f 


.  That’s what happens 
when you are around a good teacher for a long time:
  you know certain things are not 
right.  This is the way you understand 
"kama
"
","
 the pleasure of the senses. 
Ajahn Chah would never allow indulgence in 
"kama
"
", he would never encourage "
or praise that at all.  You can see in the 
"suttas"
" that neither did the Buddha, because "
205
 !
", the first "
 #
", means greed or covetousness – getting involved in"
", pursuing, "
and indulging in the pleasures of the five senses. 
 If any of you are 
Pali
" experts, you "
will 
know 
that 
 !
is 
a 
synonym 
for 

or
ignorance
","
a 
synonym 
for 
kamachanda
", "
the 
desire 
for 
sensual 
pleasure. 
It’s 
the 
foremo
st 
hindrance 
that 
weakens wisdom and blocks 
samadhi
.
"  And, because it blocks "
samadhi
", it means you "
are just putting yourself behind a large obstacle. 
 It’s hard enough as it is to get the 
peaceful states of mind that lead into 
samadhi
. 
Just Being Inside 
We’ve just finished the rains retreat and many of y
"ou have been trying very hard, "
putting a lot time into developing and creating pea
ceful states of mind.  If you throw 
away all that good work now you’ll just have to sta
rt from scratch again.  So often we 
can see those defilements of the mind and yet we ju
"stify them by saying, ‘It’s okay, "
"we can do this, it’s alright’, but we know we reall"
y shouldn’t.  So when you do see 
defilements like 
 !
" coming up, at least don’t act on them.  Don’t do a"
nything.  
Don’t turn it into an action of body and speech
.  If you confine it to the world of the 
"mind so that it just stays as a thought, as a mood,"
" you are weakening its fuel, its "
"source.  As soon as you act on it, it becomes much "
stronger psychologically and it’s 
more liable to come back again in the future.  Also
", if you can just keep it in the mind "
"you’ve got more of a chance to understand it, espec"
ially to understand its pain. 
If you have anger in the mind you know what it feel
s like.  But if you take that anger 
out on someone else you forget what 
you
 feel like because you’re only focussed on 
that other person.  It’s just the same with sensory
 desire.  If you keep it inside you can 
"feel what it's like, you can know what it’s like.  "
But if you externalise it by trying to 
"gain that object of the sensory desire, you’ve lost"
 all the mindfulness of what’s 
happening inside.  You’ve just gone out into the wo
rld and you’re not quite sure what 
"is happening in your mind, you can’t see the danger"
 in these things; you can’t see the 
negative result of following the defilements.  Inst
ead of externalising it into that being 
"or that thing or that person, spend some time just "
being inside and knowing what it 
feels like when you’ve got desire for sensory enjoy
ment.  Do the same when you’re 
206
getting angry and upset. This way you will see the 
danger in sensory pleasures and ill 
will. 
"Because we don’t see the danger in these things, wh"
"en we experience suffering, we "
don’t understand why we are suffering.  Why am I up
set?  Why am I not happy?  Why 
am I sick?  Why am I doing this?  Why is my meditat
ion not going well?  Why can’t I 
get into 
jhanas
?  You know why!  It is because you have no sense r
estraint and you 
indulge yourself too much.  You allow the defilemen
"ts, the "
 #
 to run riot in the 
mind.  Once the 
 #
 have got hold of you they are not going to just le
t you go.  
"You can’t say, ‘Right, I’m going to let you go now,"
 it’s my two weeks retreat.  Okay?  
So 
 #
", just leave me alone!’  Once you’ve started a fire"
 you can’t stop it so easily.  
That’s why the Buddha encouraged people to keep the
 precepts perfectly.  See danger 
in 
the 
slightest fault. 
Keep 
the 
rules 
of 
the mona
stery 
"perfectly, "
practise 
sense 
"restraint, and be content with little.  Be content "
"with your hut, your robes; it doesn’t "
matter whether they are synthetic or cotton.  Just 
"have simple requisites, nothing "
really flash and just a few of them. 
Living Simply 
Some of you will soon be leaving and going overseas
.  It will be very interesting to 
see how many bags you are taking.  See if you can b
e like a monk at the time of the 
"Buddha, just carrying your bowl and robes.  See how"
 little you can carry.  Ask 
"yourself, ‘What do I want all this stuff for?  When"
 I go through the airport terminals 
will I just look like another tourist in funny clot
"hes or am I going to look like a monk, "
"someone who lives simply, someone who can inspire o"
thers?’  Many lay-people have 
"pointed out to me over the years that, when they se"
e a monk coming to Perth with big 
"cases or big bags, they feel disappointed, especial"
ly a few times when they’ve seen 
monks coming with their computers.  They’ve said th
"at their hearts drop, because this "
is not the way a monk should be.  Even recently I h
eard a comment by one of the Thai 
lay-people about these sorts of monks.  He thought 
monks shouldn’t have so many 
things.  It was one of the reasons he thought that 
the 

", the teaching of the "
"Buddha, and the "
$&
 in Thailand were becoming so corrupt.  They’ve got
 too 
many things.  They’re being given too much.  They s
hould live more simply. 
207
"Living simply should be one’s goal, one’s intention"
.  When I went on 
tudong
 after 
"five years as a monk, I had to carry everything wit"
h me.  I had to walk out of the 
"monastery – not get a car to the airport, but walk "
with all the belongings I had.  There 
was 
a 
rule 
in 
that 
monastery 
at 
that 
time 
(it’s 
pro
bably 
changed 
now 
because 
monasteries 
get 
more 
and 
more 
slack; 
the 
standard 
g
oes 
down 
and 
so 
does 
the 
standard of 
samadhi
) that once you left the monastery you couldn’t lea
ve anything 
behind.  You couldn’t put it in the storeroom and s
"ay, ‘Can you put this aside for me, "
I’ll be back in a year’ or ‘put it in the room some
where over there and if I need it I 
will 
send for 
it’. 
You 
really 
had 
to 
let 
go 
of 
eve
"rything, "
all 
your 
possessions.  
"Whatever you thought was yours, you had to take wit"
h you.  You could give as much 
"away as you wanted, but what you took, you had to c"
arry.  And you had to walk with 
"it, sometimes for twenty or thirty kilometres a day"
 in Thailand.  Even in the cold 
season it is still hot for walking.  You very soon 
start to see how little you need.  I 
"thought I was really down to the minimum but, after"
 walking for two or three days 
"more, I found there were a few more things I could "
get rid of.  After two or three days 
walking you get it down to a very light pack.  The 
first thing I gave away before I 
went on 
tudong
 was the big bag in which my bowl was carried.  The
 reason was that I 
already had a bag for my bowl:  just the little cro
cheted thing which goes on the 
outside of the bowl.  What do I need another bag fo
r?  Another bag just means I can 
put more things in it.  So when I was on 
tudong
" I didn’t have a bowl bag, I just put "
everything in my monk’s shoulder bag and in my meta
l bowl.  The umbrella with the 
mosquito net and the water bottle were strapped to 
my back and that was it.  It was a 
"marvellous feeling – a feeling of pride, not in the"
" sense of ego, but in the sense of "
inspiration that one could do this.  It was possibl
e to do this and be close to the 
tudong
monks of old.  The ones who would go through the fo
rests of Thailand:  the Ajahn 
"Mun’s, the Ajahn Chah’s, the Ajahn Juan’s, all thos"
e great monks.  They didn’t have 
lots of stuff to carry.  They did not have lay-peop
le going with them to carry things.  
They would go out by themselves.  That’s a monk in 
the lineage of the Buddha – like 
a bird carrying only the weight of its wings.  So t
"hose of you, who are going soon, you "
may have already started packing and getting all yo
"ur stuff together, but see what you "
can actually leave behind.  It’s a challenge for yo
u.  See how much you can do 
without; you can always do without a bit more.  Tha
t’s simplicity. 
208
You will find simplicity means that you are not spe
nding so much time with this 
requisite 
or 
with 
that 
"requisite, "
making 
it 
more 
be
"autiful, "
more 
"fashionable, "
or 
whatever else.  It was crazy sometimes in the early
 years of Wat Pah Nanachat.  Even 
though the monks were supposed to be beyond these t
"hings, every now and then "
someone would make a new design for a bowl stand an
d some monks would be 
throwing away their old bowl stands and making a ne
w one because of fashion.  They 
wanted this new type of stand or the new type of mo
squito net.  It was shameful.  It 
really came to me when ‘Tupperware’ started to beco
me popular.  One of the monks 
was sent a little Tupperware cup with a lid on it b
"y his mother, so you could drink half "
of it and take half of it back to your hut.  This w
as a couple of years after Wat Pah 
Nanachat was started when there were drinks availab
le in the afternoon.  In those days 
when you had a drink it was made in a big kettle an
d then passed down the row.  Then 
somebody decided to get a bigger cup.  So some peop
le had a small size and some had 
a bigger size.  And in a couple of weeks a few othe
r monks had the next size up.  I 
remember one monk had this huge Tupperware cup; it 
was more like a bowl than a 
cup.  It was just amazing what the monks would get 
up to.  It meant that because 
someone had this huge cup sometimes the monks at th
e end of the line wouldn’t get 
anything.  The drink would run out before the end o
"f the line, it was gross.  But "
sometimes defilements are like that:  always wantin
"g bigger, better, and more rather "
than less. 
"The way of a monk should be simpler and smaller, no"
t more extravagant.  A monk 
"should be someone who, if a thief goes into his roo"
"m, there is nothing worth stealing.  "
"A monk shouldn’t have anything of great worth, that"
’s what being a forest monk is 
really about. 
A monk depends on alms.  If there is a person in th
e community who is poorer than 
you 
then 
you 
should 
think 
that 
is 
not 
right. 
I 
rem
ember 
that 
because 
of 
the 
conditioning of my parents and also my grandparents
.  I started feeling that it was 
wrong when huts being built in the monastery in Tha
iland were more comfortable 
than some of the ones that the villagers were livin
"g in.  I thought, ‘It’s not right; these "
209
villagers are feeding me and I’m living in a more c
omfortable hut.  If I’ve got more 
resources than they have I should be feeding them’.
  It gave me a sense of 


about how I was using resources.  How are you using
 resources?  Is it an expression 
of the defilements?  Is it an expression of the 
 #
 – of 
 !
","

","

","
 but 
especially 
 !
", the desire for material things?  Even monks can d"
esire material 
"things, the latest this or the latest that.  So, yo"
u should try and live simply.  Forget 
"about the comforts of the body, the comforts of the"
" hut, the comforts of this way or "
that way. 
We need to develop the comforts of the mind not the
 comforts of the body.  It’s a 
"waste of time worrying about this old body.  So, as"
 long as we’ve got the requisites – 
"a robe to cover our body, and it doesn’t have to be"
" the best quality cloth, it can be full "
of patches –that’s good enough.  As long as we’ve g
"ot a hut to stay in – again, it "
"doesn’t have to be the best, as long as it keeps aw"
ay the elements and gives seclusion 
"for the practise of meditation, that’s good enough."
"  If you have a good hut to stay in, "
"hang out in it, instead of hanging out in the kitch"
en or the workshop or somewhere 
"else.  We have beautiful huts in this monastery, pr"
obably some of the best huts in any 
"monastery in the world.  So stay in them, make use "
of them.  Otherwise all the people 
"who have spent all this money, donating to the mona"
stery to build these beautiful 
"huts, what merit are they getting out of it?  Somet"
"imes you should ask yourself, ‘Do I "
deserve to stay in a hut like this?’  These huts co
st a lot of money.  If you are not 
"practising properly, not walking on those meditatio"
"n paths regularly, what have you "
done to earn this?  If you’re healthy you should be
" walking on them a lot, and if you "
"are only reasonably healthy, you should be sitting "
down inside your hut doing a lot of 
meditation.  Make use of these things so that the s
acrifice of the people who built the 
hut will be worth while.  So they can look at the g
"ift that they have given, see how it "
"is being used, and feel inspired and happy. "
This is a way of overcoming the defilement of lazin
"ess, the defilement of just taking "
things easy in a beautiful hut.  The defilement of 
just sitting around having a big 
"breakfast, having a big lunch, having a big cup of "
"tea, coffee, or whatever else you "
"think you want.  All these things can be used, but "
use them well.  Use them frugally – 
210
use 
them 
to 
make 
progress 
in 
your 
meditation 
and 
to
develop 
your 
wisdom.  
"Otherwise, you’ll just be like a lay-person in robe"
"s, with the same sort of desires, the "
"same sort of hatreds, and the same sorts of movemen"
ts of the mind.  If you develop a 
lay-person’s mind you won’t want to stay in the rob
es – you will want to leave 
because you haven’t been developing the monk’s mind
", the mind of a "

", a "
recluse.  Eventually that will get the better of yo
u. 
Those are some of the dangers of the defilements.  
That’s why a Kruba Ajahn would 
stop those dangers developing.  They would tell you
" what happens if you develop lust, "
"if you fantasize, sleep too much, eat too much, or "
if you don’t spend enough time 
"sitting, or practising sense restraint.  They would"
 point out the dangers again and 
again. 
Sometimes what motivates people are the benefits of
" resisting the defilements, of "
overcoming the 
 #
.  Because if you start to resist these 
 #
", the defilements of "
"the mind, you get more and more happiness. You get "

"
"
" (complete, "
spotless happiness) as you start to keep your prece
pts and the rules of the monastery 
perfectly.  You realise that there is no cause for 
blame from any quarter in anything 
you’ve done.  
Each one of you can do that now.  Hav
e you 
got the blameless 
happiness of 

"
"
 yet?  Or are there still parts of your ethical con
duct that 
"still need to be tightened up a bit?  If so, you’re"
 just depriving yourself of happiness.  
"So, "
one 
of 
the 
benefits 
of 
keeping 
the 
precepts 
and
following 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
monastery is that you get this beautiful sense of h
"appiness, freedom from remorse, "
from 
"

"
","
 one of the five hindrances.  With that freedom fro
m remorse your 
meditation gets deeper and you get even more happin
ess from the practise of sense 
restraint.  If you practise sense restraint you get
 to the next level of happiness in the 
gradual training.  So by indulging in sitting aroun
d or standing around chatting about 
"this, about that, or just reading too many trashy b"
"ooks, you’re stopping yourself from "
getting the happiness of sense restraint. 
The happiness of sense restraint means that the min
d starts to calm down and you get 
this beautiful peacefulness inside you and around y
ou.  You’ve all experienced that 
211
peacefulness from time to time.  Sometimes you only
 experience it when you are on 
retreat and then when you come off the retreat you 
throw it away again.  Wouldn’t it 
be wonderful to just keep that peacefulness and joy
 from sense restraint all the time?  
If you really want to indulge in the senses then yo
u can volunteer to go into town at 
the weekends and I can stay here and do my meditati
on.  You can give the talks if you 
like talking a lot.  I might just put you in front 
of the microphone at our town centre 
and 
you 
can 
talk. 
What 
I’m 
saying 
here 
is 
that 
you
’ve 
got 
this 
marvellous 
"opportunity:  you don’t have to give talks, you don"
’t have to talk so much.  When I 
had just two ‘Rains’ I had to give talks.  I’m not 
sure which but after the third or 
"fourth ‘Rains’, I had to give the "
'
" service in Thai at Wat Pah Pong, with "
Ajahn Chah and a couple of hundred monks and thousa
nds of lay-people there.  That 
"was too soon, but I had to do it because Ajahn Chah"
 told me to.  In other monasteries 
you have to do these things.  Even those monks who 
say they don’t like to do these 
"things, when they go overseas they have to give tal"
ks.  You’re lucky to have so much 
"freedom, so don’t waste that time. "
 Use it 
not to i
ndulge but to really 
get into 
seclusion.

" is seclusion of the body, "

Citta#
 is seclusion of the mind.  Seclusion 
of the body means getting away from other people:  
"sitting in your hut, walking on "
your 
"path, "
and 
hanging 
out 
with 
yourself.

", "
being 
"aloof, "
"separated, "
secluded 
from 
unwholesome

", "
which 
"usually means the five hindrances, including the "
 #
", of greed, hatred, delusion, "
and sensory desire.  When you are in the hut there 
is nothing much there; that’s why 
it’s a place of seclusion.  You need to keep it tha
"t way, keep it simple with few things.  "
Keep your hut so simple that I can take a visitor t
here any time and you would expect 
the visitor to be impressed with the little you hav
"e, and how neat and tidy it is.  You "
should be aiming for the simplicity of a forest mon
k.  I have mentioned many times 
before what a great privilege it was to see Ajahn C
hah’s room; it gave you so much 
delight.  Even now I remember there was so little i
n that hut.  Here was a monk who 
was receiving all these gifts from wealthy people i
"n Bangkok and Ubon, but where he "
slept there was hardly anything at all.  A few robe
"s, a mat on the floor, a little pillow "
and that was all.  It was beautiful and inspiring t
o see that.  So if I take a visitor to 
"your hut, will they be as inspired as I was when I "
was a young monk? 
212
By developing seclusion from all these material and
" physical possessions, simplifying "
"the mind instead of filling it with more stuff, we "
"get happiness of the mind, freedom "
"of the mind, and the joy of the mind.  You’re actua"
lly getting close to the 
jhanas
", "
seclusion from the five senses.  Secluded from unwh
olesome things you can enter into 
the first 
jhana
 with 
"
"
", the bliss of such seclusion.  The "
jhanas
 are states of 
bliss.  Don’t throw away the opportunity to get tha
t bliss.  By having insight into the 
Dhamma
you’ll 
turn 
your 
whole 
life 
"around, "
especially 
you
r 
monastic 
life.  
"Remember, just before he sat down under the Bodhi t"
ree the Buddha reflected on the 
time when he first experienced a 
jhana
" under the rose apple tree.  He thought, ‘Could "
the 
jhanas
 be the way to Enlightenment and then insight came 
"up, ‘Yes, "
jhanas
 are the 
way to Enlightenment’.  It’s a powerful statement. 
 Afterwards he knew the middle 
way; the middle way is the 
jhana
" way.  When you let go of sensory pleasures, get ri"
d 
of the 
"kama
  
&"
", (the pursuit of the happiness of sensual pleasure"

"), have "
no 
kama
"
"
.  That’s straight down the line 
jhana
 practice.  So don’t throw away 
the opportunity and the chance to do this.  This is
 what leads to Enlightenment.  This 
is the path that the Buddha followed.  And for thos
e of you who have faith in the 
"Kruba Ajahns, all of those Kruba Ajahns – to the be"
st of my knowledge – said that 
such 
samadhi
 is absolutely necessary to gain Enlightenment. 
Overcoming the Defilements 
"So use this wonderful opportunity in this lifetime,"
 this rare lifetime.  Most of you have 
"healthy bodies, and if they’re not absolutely healt"
hy they’re still good enough to 
practise. 
You 
have 
the 
teachings 
available 
to 
"you,"
to 
encourage 
you. 
You’re 
protected from having to deal with too many lay-peo
ple.  You’ve good food and all 
"the resources here, so don’t just indulge in the de"
filements.  The benefit of resisting 
those defilements is that they get less and less.  
Keep them confined to the mind and 
it’s just like putting a tiger in a cage.  It might
 roar and rush against the cage bars at 
the very beginning but after a while it will stop d
oing that.  It will settle down in the 
cage and then it will be safe.  You’ll be safe from
 being terrorised and eaten by the 
"tigers of the defilements.  Eventually, when they’r"
e in a cage you can starve them to 
death – starve them so that they get weaker and wea
ker and the bliss gets stronger and 
213
stronger.  When the mind is blissed out and has tha
"t sort of strength, it can kick that "
tiger in the teeth and the tiger is too weak to do 
anything.  You’ve got hold of the 
defilements 
and 
you 
can 
wring 
their 
necks. 
No 
more
defilements 
and 
you 
get 
Enlightenment in this lifetime.  Each one of you ha
"s the possibility to do that, but if "
you keep indulging in defilements you’re just wasti
ng precious time.  I’m talking 
about wasting this precious lifetime.  When you kno
w the dangers of these things you 
will be encouraged to make a bit more effort to res
"ist, to have a bit more "


and more determination to overcome them. 
"In the simile of the two fire sticks (MN 36), even "
"if we take the sticks out of the river, "
they are still wet so we can’t start a fire with th
em.  Even if those fire sticks have been 
"lying next to the river, still they’re not dry enou"
gh – they are too wet inside.  They 
have to be taken from the river for a long time bef
"ore they dry out, before they can be "
used to light a fire.  The Lord Buddha used that si
mile for indulging in sensory 
pleasure in the world of the senses.  If you have j
ust left the world and come to the 
"monastery, it takes awhile before you dry out.  The"
 sensory world makes you damp 
and 
meditation 
can’t 
really 
take 
hold. 
You 
can’t 
g
et 
really 
fired 
up 
with 
the 
meditation.  The longer you are outside of the worl
"d, away from things, staying in a "
"monastery or in a hermitage, the more you dry out. "
 Sometimes it takes years to dry 
out.  Especially when you are drying out and then y
ou put your stick in the water and 
make it wet again.  So after a couple of years of d
"rying out, if you make it all wet "
"again you have to do another two years, four years,"
 or however long it takes to dry 
"out.  You’re just holding yourself back, not allowi"
ng yourself the opportunity to get 
into deep meditation.  Once those sticks are aflame
", once you get into the "
jhanas
 and 
"the bliss, you’ll also have clarity of mind and you"
’ll see how stupid the defilements 
"are.  You’ll just kick yourself, ‘Why on earth did "
I do those sorts of things when I was 
a young and stupid monk?  To go and find pleasure i
n the realm of the five senses – 
"what a stupid, silly thing to do!  Wasting my time "
looking out into the world too 
much.  Listening too much; listening to Mozart or w
hatever.  What a stupid waste of 
time that was.  Rather than attaching and becoming 
"entangled in the world, I could "
have just been sitting down letting go of more and 
"more defilements, and finding the "
real 
Dhamma
’. 
214
People in the world say everything is 
Dhamma
", even sexual intercourse and soccer.  "
That’s stupid!  The only 
Dhamma
 is that which is conducive to Enlightenment; that 
"is, "
the Buddha’s teaching which leads to 
!!
", "
&
", and "

.  What leads to 
that?   Those of you who know your 
"suttas"
", know that what precedes "
!!
 is seeing 
things as they truly are.  And seeing things as the
y truly are is preceded by 
samadhi
.  
So don’t forget the practise of 
samadhi
.  It’s such a delicate plant and it needs so 
"much nurturing, so much protection until it’s stron"
g.  If it’s not strong yet you can’t 
really afford to be careless.  Look after 
samadhi
.  Of all of the things I’ve talked about 
it’s much better to look after your 
samadhi
 than to look after your wisdom. 
I say that because it is much easier to know whethe
r you’ve got 
samadhi
 or not.  As 
"for wisdom, everyone thinks they’re wise, everyone "
thinks they know.  That’s why 
there is so much delusion in the world.  Many peopl
e write books on Buddhism and 
only a fraction really know what they are talking a
"bout, but all the others think they "
"know, think they are wise.  Are you one of those wh"
o think they know?  Be careful 
because it is so hard to know what real wisdom is. 
 At least with 
samadhi
 you know 
whether you’ve got a peaceful mind or not:  you kno
w whether you can sit still in 
bliss or whether you’re distracted all the time and
 can’t sit still for more than half an 
hour.  That’s easy to know!  
Samadhi
", the stillness of the mind, is a sign of real "
"wisdom, not intellectual wisdom but real wisdom. "
Let Go 
"Wisdom is the understanding of how to let go, the u"
nderstanding of 
Metta
 or non-self

ire of the five 
senses.  Wisdom is knowing

", impermanence.  Wisdom is knowing that all "
things that arise – including all of nature – will 
"cease.  Let it cease now, let it go, "
understand that wisdom.  If you really understand t
hat wisdom it means that you can 
let go.  You can just sit down and let go of the bo
"dy, let go of all the thoughts, let go "
of the 
asava
", the out-flowings of the mind.  Let go of this min"
d that seeks its 
happiness outside.  You can let go of the 
asava
", which take you outside of yourself "
"into the past and the future, into the five sense w"
"orld, to this, that and the other.  Go in "
the opposite direction don’t indulge. 
215
If you go in the opposite direction you will get al
l the beautiful happiness.  You will 
"get the inspiration, the knowledge that the Buddha "
was an

difficult thing to know.  You may think you know it

Stream Winning happens.  What actually is a Buddha?
  What is an

the Dhamma

things just waiting for you:  an amazing banquet of

 and

But we keep on eating dog pooh instead.  So what ar
e you doing that for?  Surely 
"you’ve got enough nous, wisdom, and understanding t"
o know what Enlightenment is.  
If you are really ready to let go enough and abando
n you don’t need to just follow 
what I’m saying.  You have read all of this stuff i
n the 
"suttas"
 and this is what all the 
Kruba Ajahns say. 
So why don’t you do it?  Don’t wait for tomorrow; d
on’t wait until you get to your 
next monastery in a few weeks time.  Those of you w
"ho are going tomorrow, you "
might not make it until tomorrow:

and death – do it now.  Those of you leaving on the

"you go, don’t wait.  Otherwise you’ll die and you’l"
l wonder why you wasted so much 
time.  It’s probably what happened to you in your l

please don’t allow these defilements to run riot ov

resist them.  Dry out and have the beautiful flames

 them to be able to present them to others.  If the

it’s going to be a place for all sorts of strange a

"When this is, that is. "
"With the arising of this, that arises. "
"When this is not, that is not. "
"With the ceasing of this, that ceases. "
One of the monks asked me to talk about Dependent O
rigination.  Rather than talk 
about 
that 
I 
want 
to 
pay 
more 
attention 
to 
the 
Law 
of 
"Conditionality, "
which 
is 
mentioned in the 
&
 that I just chanted at the beginning of this talk:
"  ‘When this is, "
"that is; and from the arising of this, that arises;"
" when this isn’t, then that isn’t; and "
"from the cessation of this, that ceases.’  What the"
 Buddha is talking about in this 
beautiful teaching is that everything that arises h
as its causes and conditions.  Part of 
the 
Dhamma
 is actually to see the causes and conditions which
 give rise to the various 
qualities 
and 
seeing 
that 
when 
those 
causes 
and 
con
ditions 
are 
not 
"there, "
those 
qualities cease.  So it gives us an idea of the cau
sality of the whole of 

.  
/
t 
gives us an understanding of the nature of this who
le process towards Enlightenment.  
It gives us an understanding of the process that we
 call the 
citta
", the mind. "
The Emperor’s Clothes 
One of the reasons people find it so hard to see de
"eply into, and accept fully, the "
teaching of 
Metta
 (non-self) is because most people who look inside 
themselves will 
"say that, from their experience of the world, "
there is
 something there.  When we start 
217
"to talk about what is deeply within us, we never sa"
y that there’s nothing there.  There 
"is that mysterious – but not mystical – misty, unce"
"rtain something, which people take "
"to be a ‘me’.  However, when we see that fully it r"
eveals itself as a process.  This is 
why Theravada Buddhism and the Buddhism of accompli
shed meditators disagree 
with 
people 
who 
say 
it’s 
just 
empty 
and 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
there. 
There 
is 
something there.  There is this process that you ca
n feel as being something.  Our real 
problem is that we take it to be something it isn’t
.  That which is there is just a process 
and that process is beautifully described by the Bu
"ddha:  with the arising of this, that "
"arises; and from the cessation of this, that ceases"
. 
By understanding this whole process you realise the
 root cause of 

:  the 
"illusion of this ‘being’, this ‘self’, this ‘me’.  "
As meditators we look deeply into the 
"nature of our minds, but the only way we can really"
 see that nature is to clear away all 
the undergrowth.  A simile that I like is the simil
e of the Emperor clothed from head 
to foot in five different garments.  He has a hat o
"n top of his head, a scarf around his "
"face, and a jacket over the top half of his body; h"
e has trousers on the bottom half and 
is wearing high boots.  So his whole body is covere
"d up with these five garments, the "
"hat, the scarf, the jacket, the trousers, and the b"
oots.  Because he is covered up in this 
way you can’t actually see what or who the Emperor 
truly is.  You don’t know what’s 
actually underneath all those clothes or who it is 
that’s walking along.  You don’t 
know who is speaking from behind the mask or who is
 feeling all these things and 
responding to them.  In that simile the five garmen
ts covering the Emperor are the 
"five senses of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touc"
h. 
"We often take those five senses to be me, to be the"
" ‘self’, and that’s why we think that "
they are so important to us.  We are very concerned
 with what we see and don’t see.  
We are very concerned with what we hear and don’t h
"ear.  We like to hear praise, we "
don’t like to hear blame.  We like to hear beautifu
"l sounds and, if we don’t like crows, "
we don’t like to hear the crows.  Some people like 
"to hear the cement mixer working, "
some people don’t.  It is the same with smells.  Yo
u all know that one of the smells 
that I delight in is the smell of bat pooh.  The re
ason for that is because I lived for 
three months having lovely meditations in a cave po
pulated by bats and so I always 
218
relate that sort of smell to a very happy time in m
y life.  We take these preferences to 
"be very important; we take them to be me, to be min"
e.  It’s the same with the taste the 
"food.  You like this food, you don’t like that drin"
k.  You like this amount of honey or 
sugar or coffee-mate or whatever in your tea.  We a
re very concerned with how we 
"feel in our physical body:  the aches, the pains, a"
nd the pleasures.  For many people 
this is the clothing around the whole of existence;
 it is all they know of existence.  
They are concerned with nothing else but the five s
"enses, and they never really know "
who the Emperor is behind these five senses.  So th
e only way to find out what this 
Emperor is – by the Emperor I mean 
that which you take to be the ‘self’
", the mind, "
"consciousness, the will, or whatever – is to undres"
s this Emperor somehow. 
That was the great discovery of the Buddha before h
e sat under the Bodhi tree.  Just 
"before he was about to become Enlightened, he remem"
bered the time when he was a 
"small boy sitting under a Rose Apple tree, when he "
unwittingly entered into a 
jhana
for the first time.  He recalled the experience and
 thought that maybe this is the path 
to Enlightenment.  Insight then arose and he knew t
hat was the path to Enlightenment.  
"He asked himself, ‘Why was I afraid of that pleasur"
e which is apart from the five 
"senses?’ and he thought, ‘I will not be afraid of t"
hat pleasure’.  He realised that was 
the path and he sat under the Bodhi tree and develo
ped the 
jhanas
. 
The 
jhanas
 are nothing more than the result of letting go of 
the body and the five 
senses.  The body and the five senses twirl around 
each other; they are conditioned by 
each other.  When this body dies the five senses ce
ase.  When the five senses cease 
this body dies.  They are completely dependent on o
ne another like two sticks holding 
each other up.  When these five senses actually dis
appear through the practice of 
meditation then that reveals the nature of the 
citta
.  It’s like taking the clothes off the 
Emperor and finding out who is underneath.  Who is 
saying all these words?  Who is 
deciding to think this way?  Who is deciding to do 
this?  Who gets angry and who 
gets happy?  What is all of this?  You need to be a
ble to investigate like this in order 
to be able to find out what’s inside.  Of course yo
u then come up with what we call 
the 
citta
","
 the mind.  That’s why the first experience – befor
e you even get to a 
jhana
 – 
is seeing a beautiful 
Citta
","
" a beautiful light, radiant, wonderful, and very st"
ill.  
219
You understand why the Buddha said this mind is rad
iant (
!
) when it is not 
defiled from outside.  Remove the clothing from the
 Emperor and the mind appears 
brilliant and beautiful. 
"This is a very beautiful, very enjoyable, fun way o"
f becoming Enlightened.  But the 
main purpose is to get to know what it is that’s un
"derneath all of those clothes, and of "
course the actual Emperor looks very different from
 the clothes.  This is the reason 
people who have deep experiences of meditation have
 such a difficult time trying to 
explain it to other people.  It’s important to have
 access to a monk or a teacher who 
has 
experienced 
these 
"states, "
because 
they 
have 
a 
m
uch 
better 
chance 
of 
understanding your particular descriptions and whet
her your experiences fit in with all 
the 
jhanas
".  If a person has been to Paris many, many times, "
then they are more likely 
to understand the first time visitor’s description 
of Paris.  This is all it really is. 
The Builder 
The realm of the 
citta
", the realm of the mind, is a different world.  It’"
s amazing how 
"few people ever get to such a place, or ever realiz"
e what such a place is like.  That is 
because they don’t have enough data to start the pr
ocess of Enlightenment.  When you 
start to experience the 
citta
" alone and see this whole process, it’s like seeing"
 the 
Emperor with all his clothes off.  You see what thi
s person really is and then you’ve 
got a chance of overcoming the illusion of self.  Y
ou are actually looking at the 
process that you take to be you.  You see the proce
"ss of the will, and the ‘doer’ is seen "
for what it is.  In the 
jhanas
" all that stops for awhile, and there is the sense "
of being 
"frozen, not being able to do anything.  That gives "
you a very powerful insight – an 
insight 
not 
based 
on inference 
but 
based 
on the 
exp
erience 
– that 
there 
is 
pure 
"mindfulness, "
a 
great 
"awareness, "
but 
you 
are 
not 
doi
ng 
"anything, "
you 
can’t 
do 
anything.  That is when you start to see that the w
ill is just a process.  Before that you 
thought the will was you.  If it really was you it 
couldn’t stop.  If it was you and it did 
"stop, then you would die:  the self would just disi"
"ntegrate, and the soul would be "
abolished. 
220
When you start to see the will ceasing and experien
ce that state for a long period of 
"time, it’s seen as a condition, a process.  You the"
"n see that which does:  the chooser, "
"the decider, the generator of thoughts, the will, w"
hat the Buddha once described as the 
builder.  This is what Dependent Origination is all
" about, "




", "
"‘when this is, then that occurs’.  Once you see tha"
"t will is not coming from you, you "
look back and start to see the whole process of cau
sality.  
You
 are not choosing to do 
"these things.  Why did I decide to talk like this, "
this evening?  Why do I decide to 
scratch my ear?  You start to see after a while tha
t this is not coming from a person 
"inside, it is not coming from a self.  It is comple"
tely conditioned. 
"Once you start to understand what we call choice, t"
"he movement of the mind, you see "
"it is conditioned, fully conditioned, one hundred p"
"ercent conditioned, and then you "
can start investigating the conditions.  You questi
on what is the condition that makes 
you 
do 
"this, "
what 
condition 
makes 
you 
do 
that? 
And
then 
you 
find 
the 
best 
"conditioning.  Because, wherever you are in the wor"
"ld, there will always be some "
conditioning or brainwashing going on.  The best co
nditioning if you really want to be 
happy and become Enlightened is to hang out in mona
steries.  If you come here every 
"Wednesday evening, then you get brainwashed by me, "
and that’s much better than 
being brainwashed by the T.V. or being brainwashed 
by the shopping malls.  Why is 
it that when you go to the shopping mall you buy al
l those things?  You are being 
brainwashed – the conditioning is not coming from y
"ou, it’s coming from outside. "
Once you begin to experience this you start to unde
rstand how this mind and body 
"work, and then you can start playing around as it w"
ere with the conditioning.  When 
you start playing around with conditioning you real
ize that if you want to be peaceful 
you have to create the conditions for peacefulness.
"  You can’t just say, ‘Now I am "
"going to be peaceful’ or, ‘now I am going to be hap"
py’.  You have to know the 
"conditions for happiness, the conditions for peace,"
 the conditions for 
jhana
", and you "
the conditions for liberation.  This is what Depend
ent Origination is all about.  Once 
you begin to notice what the conditions for happine
ss are you know that you can get 
the grosser happiness’s in the world from making go
od 
kamma
.  By doing good things 
221
"you get happiness, and that should not be belittled"
 by monks who are practising for 
the higher happiness’s of 
jhanas
 and insight. 
Even the lower happiness’s are a very important sup
port for the path:  that’s why 
monks should keep 
 
 and make merit.  I was very pleased once to come a
cross a 
passage in one of the 
"suttas"
" where the Buddha said, ‘Monks you too should make "
"merit, should make "
Panna
"’.  When I first read that I thought deep down, ‘I’"
ve always 
"thought that’.  But sometimes you hear monks say, ‘"
"No that’s just merit, that’s for lay "
people and not necessary for monks.  Lay people sho
"uld build all the toilets, sweep "
"the monastery, feed us and wash up afterwards becau"
se we have more important 
things to do’.  But by helping to build a monastery
", going out to give talks, helping "
"people, you are helping the "

", and it’s important to make that merit.  If you ma"
ke 
"merit properly, with compassion, with love – rather"
 than just doing it because you 
have to – if you do whatever service is asked of yo
"u in this monastery willingly, and "
"even more than you’re asked for the sake of merit, "
then you will get very happy.  And 
that happiness will be a cause of tranquillity; the
 tranquillity will be the cause of 
samadhi
", and "
samadhi
 will be the cause of insight and the cause leading
 to Liberation.  
It is just the usual conditioned process of things.
  The Buddha knew that.  The great 
Ariyas
 knew that and the Kruba
Ajahns in Thailand know that.  All the great teache
rs 
know that.  That’s why they encourage monks to make
" merit, even though it may be "
"tiring, because it’s a really worthwhile thing to d"
o.  If you know how to do it properly 
"and you do it willingly without begrudging it, it e"
"nhances your meditation, and you "
know it’s the cause for having worldly happiness an
d good health. 
You begin to realize that the cause for this underl
ying happiness is keeping the 
precepts.  You see that keeping the precepts actual
ly causes a very powerful long 
lasting happiness. You also see that if you break t
he precepts you are just creating 
suffering for yourself.  It is cause and effect tha
t’s all.  Even something like alcohol 
just creates suffering for you.  When you see the c
ause and affect you really see that 
there is no way you can keep on doing those stupid 
"things, it doesn’t make any sense "
at all.  Take lying or getting angry at other peopl
e:  what does anger actually do for 
you?  Does it help you get your own back on the oth
er person?  Anger just burns you 
222
up.  You see that anger is not the cause for happin
ess; anger just takes you into the 
hell realms. 
I’m sure everyone from time to time has had anger c
ome up.  When you’re angry you 
feel very justified that your anger is really worth
"while and right, because the other "
person has really done something they shouldn’t hav
e done.  
If ever you get angry it’s 
never the other person’s fault.  It’s your fault
.  There is no reason to get angry ever.  
"For the wise person, the liberated person, no matte"
"r what other people do to them, "
"whether they are right or wrong, it’s no reason to "
get angry.  Anger just causes 
suffering for you.  So knowing that anger causes su
ffering and knowing how cause 
"and effect works, stops all that silly stuff from c"
"oming up.  Of course, this is just "
"keeping precepts, keeping virtue, keeping restraint"
.  But then you realize that you can 
go deeper and you start to let go of concern for th
e world:  the world of the past and 
"future, your plans and your memories, the doing and"
" the thinking, philosophising, and "
the arguing – you let go of all of that.  You let g
o of all your concepts of 
Dhamma
 and 
!!
.
  By getting into silence you start to see things a
nd that gives you a deeper 
sense of happiness. 
Focusing on that and getting the insight of that ha
ppiness you start to realize why 
meditation is so important and what type of meditat
ion is important.  You start to see 
that all the planning and the lingering on the past
", all of the conceptions and thinking "
"about of the past, are just suffering.  It causes s"
"uffering, it doesn’t cause Liberation.  "
All the thinking in the world is not a cause for th
e liberation the mind or liberation 
from 

.  It just keeps you tied to the wheel and that sho
uld be an easy cause and 
"effect to see.  If you truly see it, it will become"
 very easy to meditate.  You realize that 
"when there is thinking, there are headaches, suffer"
"ing, problems, things to do, and "
business in your world. 
A Maestro of Silence 
"When that thinking stops, "




", in its place comes the silence, the "
beautiful silence.  Then you begin to let go of the
" body, the five senses, by focusing "
223
"on just one sense, the physical sense of the breath"
.  Allow that to be the only thing you 
"are paying attention to – not listening, not smelli"
"ng, not tasting, not hearing – just "
feeling the breath and nothing else.  Then allow th
at to disappear and with it the five 
senses.  Letting go of the breath you realize that 
these five senses are the cause of 
"misery, because when they go you are happy.  The bl"
iss you get when the five senses 
disappear is much greater than anything you can get
 through the senses.  Even in the 
"heaven realms, where the five sense pleasures reach"
" their limit, they are still much "
lower than the happiness and bliss of the 
jhana
 realms. 
So 
this 
teaching 
– 
if 
you 
can 
experience 
these 
thin
gs 
– 
shows 
us 
the 
cause 
of 
suffering.  Worldly suffering is just these five se
nses.  I don’t know why people want 
to protect the five senses.  I know that a couple o
f the monks are going to see the 
"optician tomorrow; maybe if they became blind, that"
 would be one less sense to worry 
about.  My nose is sensitive to pollen and I get ha
"y fever, but it’s not sensitive to "
smells.  I remember telling Ajahn Jagaro how happy 
"I was, because if a lady wears "
"perfume or if she smells of sweat, it all smells mu"
ch the same to me because of my 
nose.  That’s one sense base I don’t have to worry 
about.  Isn’t that wonderful? 
It’s wonderful when the senses disappear.  You get 
a feeling of freedom.  It’s as if the 
"mind is freed from the burden of the five senses, f"
"rom the irritation of the five senses, "
always having to be looking and seeing.  When you l
"ook at your room, you have to go "
and tidy it up or dust it or something because it’s
" never tidy, at least not for very long.  "
"When you see things in the monastery, you see every"
"thing that needs doing, all the "
"bricks that need moving, all the work that is requi"
red.  When you start listening to 
"what people say, you sometimes get angry, because w"
hat they say is not what they 
should be saying.  It’s not correct.  They haven’t 
got it right.  These five senses create 
so many problems in the world that it’s surprising 
people celebrate them.  They have 
great big parties and fireworks displays because th
ey are celebrating the sight and the 
sound of bangs.  Or take the great orchestras:  the
 poor men and women in those 
"orchestras, in those fancy clothes, have to practic"
e and practise to be able to play 
music like that.  What suffering!  They think they 
are getting somewhere in life.   
224
Wouldn’t it be wonderful to be a maestro of silence
", to be able to let go of all of that "
"and have the bliss, which is greater than any symph"
ony? 
This is where one starts to see the cause of a huge
 amount of worldly suffering:  just 
these five senses.  With the arising of that type o
f knowledge you begin to see with 
"insight, based on the experience of the five senses"
.  You also experience what it’s like 
when the five senses are not there.  You compare th
e two and it’s just as plain as the 
nose on Pinocchio’s face that the five senses are s
"o much suffering, and the bliss "
when the five senses are not there is so much great
er. 
These are experiential insights that you cannot dis
miss.  With the insights that you get 
"through thinking and through inference, you can som"
etimes have the wrong insight 
because you haven’t got the full information.  Many
 people get lost in that way.  But 
the experiential insights that arise can’t be put a
side.  That’s why anyone who has 
"these deep experiences, even early in their life, j"
ust can’t forget them.  They are the 
"most important things in your life.  Eventually, so"
"oner or later, they’ll lead you into "
brown robes and keep you there.  These experiences 
are showing you that there is 
something else that is important in life. 
Letting Go 
"The Buddha said that delusion, "

" or ignorance, the first factor of Dependent "
"Origination, is the root cause of the whole of "

.  When the Buddha taught 
Dependent Origination he was talking about how 

 works and how this whole 
process of mind goes from life to life.  When the m
ind gets involved with the body 
there is the illusion that these five senses are im

are to be found there. 
Lack of insight into the five senses and the five

that the

" will go on planning and doing, through body, speec"

"That planning and doing, through body, speech and m"

"illusion that there is something to make, something"
" useful to do, or something that has "
"to be done.  When you stop all the doing, then you "
really have fun.  When you stop 
"doing things and let go, that’s when you experience"
 these 
jhana
 states. 
The 
jhanas
 are no more than stages of letting go
.  The more you let go and the more 
"that disappears, the closer you get to "
jhanas
".  If you let go a lot, these things just "
happen all by themselves.  
The 
jhanas
 are conditioned by letting go
.  That’s a very 
powerful teaching.  When you’re meditating always r
emember the Third Noble Truth.  
It shows you how to let go.  It gives you the under
lying theme of 
&
(giving or 
"letting go); this doesn’t belong to you, give it up"
.  The five senses don’t belong to you.  
They are not you and they have nothing to do with y
ou.  
-&
 and 
"

:  you can 
throw the sense away and free yourself from them.

", not allowing these five "
"senses to stick anywhere, and lastly "
	&&
", renouncing them, saying, “No way "
"five senses, I’m not interested”.  If you can reall"
y do that it’s called ‘letting go’.  You 
"renounce sounds, ‘I’m not interested in hearing’; j"
ust shut yourself off from sounds.  
‘I’m not interested in feeling; I’m not interested 
in this body’ – just cut off this body; 
it doesn’t belong to you and it’s not yours.  “I’m 
not even going to scratch it because 
if I start getting involved in this body then I’m s
tuck; consciousness becomes stuck to 
this body.  I’m going to free myself”.  Once you re
"member that in your meditation, "
"you’re letting go of the doer, the controller, the "
$
. 
You can only really let go if you’ve got a bit of w
"isdom, understanding, and insight.  "
You need enough insight to have the courage and the
 faith to let go completely.  Many 
meditators get close to these 
jhanas
 but they can’t let go of that last bit of ego.  Th
ey 
"want to control, to do, to be in charge of deep med"
"itations, rather than just letting go, "
sitting 
"back, "
and 
enjoying 
the 
journey. 
Give 
contr
ol 
over 
to 
the 
process. 
The 
$
 are the same as this whole craving of 
tanha
" (thirst), "
"
"
" (taking up), "
and 
!
 (existence).  In the latter part of the Dependent 
Origination it’s a different 
"way of saying the same thing, because the making of"
kamma
" is all based on craving, "
which is the fuel for more existence and birth.  Al
"l this doing, all this reacting, all this "
"making, all this wanting and not wanting is what ca"
uses rebirth.  It provides the fuel 
for 

", the fuel for more existence. "
226
Once you can see this whole cause and effect relati
onship you know why rebirth 
happens and why consciousness passes from one life 
to the next life.  You see the 
causal relationship that is there.  One important t
echnical point with causality – 


","


", ‘this being, that comes to be’ – is to know that "
in the 
Pali
 it 
does not mean that these things have to happen at t
"he same moment, or that when one "
thing exists the other thing has to be right there 
at the same time.  It doesn’t mean the 
causes or the conditions follow each other from mom
ent to moment.  Sometimes 
"causes take a long time to generate their effects, "
in the same way that 
kamma
 and its 
results are often far apart.  The 
kamma
 of today sometimes doesn’t give its results 
"until next week, next month, next lifetime, or some"
 other lifetime.  That’s still just 
"conditionality, the law of "
kamma
. 
"Once one understands that, one can see how one is c"
reating conditions now for both 
this life and the next life.  You understand how yo
u are making your rebirth and how 
are you are making 

.  You understand how birth happens and how one get
s a 
particular role as soon as there is that birth.  Wi
"th birth come the five senses, and the "
sense 
"bases, "
and 
#
"(feeling), "
and 
all 
the 
factors 
that 
follow 
after 
**
(consciousness) and 


" (mind and body), to old age, sickness, and death. "
"Because, when there are those things, there are alw"
ays going to be the experiences 
"and the sensations of old age, sickness and death, "
and the suffering of all that.  This is 
all Dependent Origination really is.  It shows you 
the cause of rebirth and how rebirth 
is ended. 
It’s Already Too Late 
Dependent Cessation is the opposite of Dependent Or
igination.  

 (ignorance) is 
finished with when you actually see the nature of t
his mind and see that there is no 
‘doer’.  It’s just a process; you see all the cause
s and the reasons why you do these 
things.  You even see that ‘that which knows’ is ju
st a process; consciousness is also 
just a process.  There is not a being in here who h
"ears all this, there is not a person "
inside who has all these thoughts.  Consciousness c
"omes and goes, rises and falls.  "
"Sometimes it is one consciousness, sometimes it’s a"
nother consciousness.  Know the 
227
difference between the six consciousnesses.  They a
"re all very separate, very different "
– if you know the differences it is much easier to 
see consciousness arising and then 
falling away and another one arising afterwards.  I
t’s important to split up these 
consciousnesses and to know the difference between 
them.  It is especially important 
to know mind-consciousness in its receptive mode.  
Once you can see all of this you 
realize there is no entity in here experiencing all
" these things.  So, why do you want to "
experience?  People just want to be; it is 
!
""""
tanha
", the craving to exist.  Instead of "
saying 
"!""tanha"
", the craving to exist, perhaps it is better to say"
 the craving to 
experience.  We all want to experience more and mor
"e in the world, we want to go to "
different places and see different thing.  We are j
ust craving to experience.  When will 
you be finished with all this experiencing?  There 
is no end to experiencing different 
"things, different sensations, but that’s all it is:"

"dukkha"
#
 or the 
#
" in between – that is agreeable feeling, disagreeab"
"le feeling, or indifferent or "
neutral feeling – or each of the six senses. 
There are just eighteen different types of 
#
 (feeling) and that’s all you can have.  
They’re just packaged in different wrapping but rea
lly there are only eighteen.  If 
you’ve experienced each one of those different

things to experience in this world.  So:  been ther
"e, done that!  Have an end to it.  "
"When one sees in this way, it’s the cause for cessa"
tion. 
The Buddha talked about Dependent Cessation startin
g with 

 (ignorance) being 
"abandoned, and actually having insight into the Fou"
r Noble Truths that the body and 
"mind, all experience, all the senses, are suffering"
.  Once you start to see that fully then 
!!
 comes up:  you’re just not interested in this sens
ory experience any more.  
Once 
!!
 comes up it doesn’t matter.  There is no person in
side who refuses to do 
"this or do that.  It’s just a natural process, and "
"whether you like it or not, it happens.  "
That’s why I keep saying that once people hear and 
understand these teachings it’s 
"already too late; you’re already on the bus, You ar"
e going to become Enlightened 
228
whether you like it or not.  So you might as well s
top wriggling and screaming and 
just all become monks or nuns.  Get it over and don
e with as quickly as possible.  
Forget about your world.  Forget about your jobs an
d money.  Forget about your 
travel plans.  Forget about all that and just let i
"t all go.  It’s going to happen anyway, "
whether you come kicking or screaming or whether yo
u come gently.  Realizing that 
"whole process which leads to Enlightenment, you rea"
lize there is no one in there to 
hasten it along or to slow it down.  Once 

 is overcome it’s just causes and effects 
working their way out.  The knowledge of non-self i
s there.  These are the Four Noble 
Truths.  The process that ends 

" is inevitable, it has begun, and it cannot be "
stopped.  You see the complete empty nature of the 
mind.  You see that the body is 
"empty of a self, empty of a core.  It is just an em"
pty process.  There is no real 
happiness or joy in that process.  Happiness and jo
y is found in ending things.  Seeing 
"that, whether you like it or not, your world become"
s reconditioned. 
By ending things you become an

" is one who seeks endings, who just "
wants to stop.  It’s not the person who wants to st
"op, it’s just the experience.  Insight "
is what makes things stop.  There is no interest an
"y more, and so there is nothing to "
keep 

 going.  One has seen through the whole process of 
"body and mind, one "
has seen through the senses playing around.  You se
e that there is not one of the 
eighteen different types of feelings that is worth 
anything; so finish with it.

tanha
", the craving to enjoy the five senses, wants to fi"
nd happiness in having a 
"nice meal, in sex, in going to see a nice movie, an"
d in going here or there.  What a 
stupid idea!  Once you’ve seen the 
Dhamma
 you see that is complete idiocy.  Hearing 
"nice music is not going to satisfy you, it’s just i"
rritating.  There is no sound as 
beautiful as silence.  Trying to find pleasure in t
he body?  Each one of you has 
meditated long enough now to know that the best ple
asure in the body is when the 
body disappears and you get into a deep meditation.
  That’s the only time the body’s 
"not hot or cold, hasn’t got an ache or a fever, and"
 hasn’t got a headache or a gut ache 
229
or whatever other ache you have.  The only time the
re is any real comfort is when the 
"body disappears, when the sense of touch is complet"
ely turned off.  I don’t know why 
people want to play around in that world of 
kama
""""
tanha
", craving for sensuality in the "
"five senses, or "
"!""tanha"
", the craving to exist.  What do you want to exist "
for?  Why 
do you want to be?  Why do you want to experience a

once it’s actually seen.  When those things disappe
"ar, there are no "
$
" made, "
"there is no craving, there is no attachment, you’re"
" not making existence, "
!
.  So 
when you see that the causes of rebirth are uproote
d and there is nothing there that is 
"going to give rise to any rebirth, that’s when one "
"knows what Enlightenment, what "

", is.  There are no causes and nothing is making re"
birth.  The natural process 
"has worked its way out, it has worked its way throu"
gh the last of the lingering 
delusions about craving.  Any possibility of happin
"ess in the sense world is gone, and "
"you’re someone who just likes ending things, simpli"
"fying things, because the world "
outside has no meaning for you.  The only thing tha
t has meaning for you is spreading 
the 
Dhamma
 and helping other people out of compassion while y
ou’ve still got the 
energy.  When they die it’s not really the 

 or 

" who dies, because there "
"was no one there to die, it’s just a process that e"
nds.  That’s why you never say that 

" die, they "
%!!
.  
%!!
 means this whole process finally comes 
to a grinding halt and everything just dissipates a
"nd disappears, never to arise again.  "
That’s 
the 
ending 
of 
the 
whole 
cycle 
of 

. 
Seeing 
in 
that 
way 
and 
understanding the Buddha’s full teaching becomes ve
ry beautiful. 
At this point it becomes clear that putting off one
’s Enlightenment to become a 
Bodhisattva makes no sense.  If you can see the 
Dhamma2
 the whole idea is to get out 
and 
help 
as 
many 
people 
as 
you 
can 
by 
teaching 
the 
Dhamma
. 
After 
your 
Enlightenment you are an example to people of the h
appiness that arises from letting 
go of the sensory world.  You are a beacon to peopl
e so that they too can find their 
way 
out 
of 
this 
jungle 
of 
"excitements, "
sensory 
plea
"sures, "
anger 
and 
"delight, "
"disappointments, frustrations, and all that sort of"
" stuff.  Good monks and good nuns, "
who are 

", can lead a lot of people out of "

", because they are already on "
the way out themselves.  If they don’t know the way
" out themselves, how can they "
lead other people out of the blazing house of 

?  This is a process that is 
beyond stopping.  You cannot put off Enlightenment 
once you’ve seen the 
Dhamma
230
anymore than you can break the laws of gravity or t
he natural laws.  There is a natural 
law that once one is a Stream Winner one has to end

 sooner or later.  One 
cannot stop it because there is no one in here to s
top it.  It’s all running according to 
the natural law of cause and effect.  From the cess
"ation of this, that ceases, "


 – 
#
"
"
:  from the cessation of the stupidity of thinking 
that there is 
"someone inside, that you are the owner of things, a"
" possessor of experiences, of will, "
and of knowing – 

 soon ceases. 
"It does not happen automatically the next moment, s"
ometimes it takes seven years or 
seven lifetimes.  But at least you know 

"
"
", that these five "

", the "
whole of 


", this whole world that you know – that you think i"
s something 
real but which is just an empty process – will ceas
e and end.  Isn’t it wonderful that it 
"can end?  The Buddha kept on saying, “"
!!

"

", "
!!
 is the 
ultimate happiness.  If you don’t believe that then
" just end things slightly, give things "
"away, let go of things, and you will see that the m"
ore you let go the more happiness 
you get.  End a lot and you get a lot of happiness;
 end completely and you get the 
"ultimate happiness, the complete happiness of "
!!
.  So this is just the cause and 
"effect nature of the mind, the cause and effect nat"
ure of the world.  There is no God 
"running all of this, there is no self inside you pl"
"anning all of this, it’s just a process. "
You’re fortunate to be brainwashed by this talk on 
the Law of Conditionality.

16  BREAKING THE BARRIER 
The Five Hindrances 
15
th
 of August 2001 
The 
Buddha 
talked 
about 
the triple 
"practice, "
of 
 
", "
samadhi
 and 
Panna
", "
"virtue, "
"concentration, and wisdom.  In this monastery, espe"
"cially at this time of the year, the "
community is keeping a very sufficient practise of 
 
.  Your restraint and the keeping 
of the precepts are admirable.  One usually doesn’t
 need to talk too much about that. 
Solitude is one of the best ways of encouraging the
 maintenance of the precepts.  The 
"more often people meet, talk, and associate togethe"
"r, the more opportunity there is for "
breaking the precepts.  Meeting other people allows
 the defilements of the mind to 
"arise, and that is the cause of precepts being brok"
en.  In solitude the precepts are less 
likely to be broken.  The stimulation of living amo
"ngst other people, of being in their "
"company, is reduced.  Therefore you are less likely"
 to err. 
So this is a time of solitude.  It is a time for mo
nks to be alone and not engage in 
conversations.  It is a time for not doing so much.
  It is a time of great purity for your 
precepts.  During the first half of the retreat I h
"ave focused on using whatever tools, "
"skilful means, and tricks I have learnt in my lifet"
"ime as a meditator, to instruct, "
"encourage, and inspire you on the path to the devel"
opment of deeper and deeper 
samadhi
.  The purpose of 
samadhi
 is to overcome the five hindrances and provide the
"data for ‘insight’ to work with.  That data, and th"
"at insight, will come later on in this "
retreat. 
Liberating the Mind 
People often rush ahead of themselves.  They start 
thinking and forming views about 
reality 
before 
they 
have 
any 
experience 
of 
such 
thi
ngs 
as 
the 
jhanas
", "
the 
deep 
meditation states of ‘letting go’.  Such speculatio
n is merely 
*
", the proliferation "
"of the mind, its ideas, fantasies, and dreams.  I u"
sually like to leave that subject until 
much later in the retreat. 
Having the deliberate idea of overcoming these five
 hindrances is very important.  It 
232
is the barrier of the five hindrances that blocks t
he door to both the 
jhanas
 and 
wisdom.  It is the five hindrances that fuel 

","
 ignorance.  The Buddha said that 
"they are the nutriments, the food, of delusion.  If"
 the five hindrances are present in the 
"mind, we cannot trust our ideas or views. "
Everybody thinks they are right; that’s a self-evid
ent truth.  There is not one person in 
this room who would say they have wrong view.  We a
lmost always think we are 
"right.  However, if we think we are wrong, then in "
that sense we are right.  This is 
because we have finally seen that we were wrong. 
It 
is 
fascinating 
to 
contemplate 
that. 
In 
the 
earl
y 
years 
of 
my 
monastic 
life 
I 
"wondered, ‘why is it that good monks argue, and tha"
t people in this world have 
differences of opinion?’  If we investigate we can 
see the reason why.  It is because of 
the work of the five hindrances:  they bend percept
"ion, bend reality, bend thought, and "
bend views to suit their purposes.  Psychology call
s that ‘denial’.  We see what we 
want to see.  We perceive what we think is there.  
That’s why there are so many 
"people in this world who are so committed, absolute"
"ly sure, absolutely certain, that "
"they are on the right path.  Some people, who are c"
"ommitted absolutely, even believe "
"that they are Stream-winners, Non-Returners, or "
Arahants
.  They can’t see the truth 
because of the power of the hindrances. 
So it is important to know and overcome these hindr
ances.  There is an acid test to 
know whether or not those hindrances are overcome. 
 That test is the ability to enter 
into 
jhanas
.  The hindrances are the very things that block 
jhanas
.  Using the metaphor 
"of entering a building or a house, if the door is w"
"ide open, there is nothing stopping or "
baring a person from entering.  If the hindrances a
"re absent, really absent, there is "
nothing to stop a person from entering into the sta
tes of absorption.  The reason these 
things are called hindrances is because they stop o
ne from entering the 
jhanas
.  They 
fuel 

 or delusion.  The hindrances hinder not only wisdo
m; they also block the 
passage into 
jhanas
. 
Using these criteria tells us whether we are ready 
to develop the enlightening wisdom 
"yet, whether we are ready to actually look into the"
" nature of things, like the mind, the "
233
"body, and the other "

.  This shows us not only whether we are ready to d
o 
"these things, but also what these hindrances really"
 are and how subtle they can be. 
People sometimes think that they have overcome the 
"hindrances.  But they have not, "
because they are still too far away from being able
 to enter into a 
jhana
.  Entering the 
jhanas
 is the acid test.  That is why I can’t see any rea
son for a person to stop at the 
entrance into a 
jhana
" and say, “This is good enough!  Now I can contempl"
ate.  Now I 
"will be able to find out”.  The usual practice, the"
" common practice, is to suppress the "
"hindrances and then having as it were, the door of "
jhana
 wide open to us.  The 
jhana
just happens:  the 
jhana
" sucks us in or I should say sucks the mind in, suc"
ks awareness 
in.  It shows us states where the hindrances are ov
ercome.  It’s a moot point whether 
we could stop at the gate into 
jhanas
 anyway. 
I’ve mentioned on many occasions that there comes a
 time in the practise of 
samadhi
when a snowball effect happens.  
We can neither sto
"p the process, nor can we "
accelerate it.  We become just an observer.  With t
his wonderful focussing of the mind 
"and abandoning of the world, that effect gets stron"
ger.  It gets stronger in the same 
way as a snowball that is rolling down a hill gets 
larger and larger.  We might be able 
to stop the snowball somewhere near the top of the 
hill.  But when the snowball gets 
"right down to the valley, it’s so big and it’s so f"
ast that I can’t see how it can be 
stopped.  We call that state 
"
"
samadhi
 (neighbourhood 
samadhi
).  It is the 
outside edges of the 
jhanas
 were there are no hindrances.  I cannot see how th
e mind 
can stop and linger with 
"
"
 sam

dhi
.  The process will pull the mind through 
into the 
jhana
.  The 
jhana
" is a state without hindrances, which can be clearl"
y seen 
when one emerges from the 
jhana
.  Those hindrances stay knocked out for a long 
time.  If a 
jh

na
" has not been achieved, the five hindrances, togeth"
er with discontent 
"and weariness, of the body and mind invade the mind"
 and remain. 
When a 
jhana
 has been achieved these things can’t invade the mi
nd.  They can’t 
"remain, and there is freedom from the hindrances.  "
This has classically been seen as 
the precursor to the arising of deep insight.  Insi
ght gives rise to the powers and the 
fruits of the practice.  It happens because the fiv
"e hindrances are overcome, and the "
mind 
can 
look 
back 
over 
those 
"experiences, "
the 
jhanas
. 
Standing 
on 
those 
234
"experiences, resting on them, based on them you hav"
e the data to actually see into the 
nature of the mind and the body – the nature of the
 five 

", and the nature of "
the sense bases.  Without that data it’s very hard 
to imagine how anyone would be 
able see the truth. 
So overcome those five hindrances and use that stat
e of the 
jhanas
 as the place where 
one focuses one’s investigation in order to discove
"r why, where and how those states "
came about and what they mean.  Suppressing the fiv
e hindrances is the key to this 
whole practice that we call the liberation of the m
ind.  You’ve heard about these five 
"hindrances often before, but they can always be res"
tated and explained at deeper and 
"deeper levels.  Remember, these five hindrances are"
" not just ordinary sensory desire, "
"ill-will, restlessness and remorse, sloth and torpo"
"r, and doubt. "
Sometimes we look at our minds and think:  ‘I’ve go
t no sensory desire.  I don’t really 
want anything.  I’ve got no lust or greed.  I’m not
" looking for a cup of tea or food, for "
"women, or whatever.  I’ve got no ill-will towards a"
"nybody, towards myself, or to "
anything.  I haven’t got any real restlessness or s
loth and torpor.  I’ve got no real 
doubts.  I know I’m alright’.  That happens very of
"ten, but it’s not sufficient.  We "
can’t get into 
jhanas
 from that state.  That’s why I tell people that wh
en we’re 
"meditating, if there is a blockage, if we can’t get"
" further, it must be because of one of "
"the hindrances, one of the "

. 
"Be methodical in the meditation practise, don’t was"
te so much time.  Discover which 
"hindrance is blocking progress, identify the proble"
"m, and actually find a solution.  "
I’ve got tremendous faith in the Buddha’s teaching.
  If there were six hindrances or 
seven hindrances or eight hindrances the Buddha wou
"ld have said so.  The usual list, "
"the five hindrances, is sufficient to describe all "
the obstacles between the meditator 
and 
jh

na
.  So we should look at those and investigate them.
Sensual Desire 
)chanda
",the most important hindrance, comes first.  "
)chanda
 is not just 
sensory desire.  There are times when the English t
ranslation of these terms leaves so 
much to be desired.  People who just follow those E
nglish translations miss so much.  
235
I learned a lot of 
Pali
 from the 
+
", the disciplinary and procedural rules for "
"monks, because there these terms are given a very p"
ractical meaning.  In 
Pali
","
chanda
is what we have to do if we cannot attend a meeting
 of the community of monks and 
we want to give approval and agreement to what’s ha
ppening there.  We give our 
‘
chanda
’
 to go ahead in our absence.  
-Chanda
" is agreement, approval, consent, and it’s "
much more subtle than mere desire.  It means that w
"e are really buying into this, "
"giving in to this, wanting it, approving it.  We ar"
e allowing it to happen.  In the same 
way that we have 
chanda
 in the 
+
", we have "
kamachanda
 in the five hindrances.  
We give our approval for the sensory world to be in
" our minds, in our consciousness.  "
We accept it.  We approve of it and we play with it
.  That’s all 
chanda
.  We’re letting 
sensual desire completely occupy the mind.  That’s 
much more subtle than just mere 
desire.  The 
kama
 part means all that is contained in 
kama 
","
the world of the five 
senses.  The 
kama 
" realms include the hell realm, the animal realm, t"
he ghost 
"realm, the "
"human realm, and the "
#
 realms.  
)chanda
" is the acceptance, "
"agreement, and consent for that world to occupy us."
The hindrance of 
kamachanda
 can be anything from the extremes of lust to just 
being 
concerned with how the body is doing.  The thinking
 about the letter that we have to 
"write, or the rain pattering on the roof, thinking "
about our huts or what needs to be 
"built next or were we are going to go next,  That i"
s all in the 
kama 
" world, is all "
sensual desire.  
)chanda
 also includes 
kama
", or sensuous thoughts about "
those things.  It can be thoughts about family or h
"ealth, about coming here or going "
there.  Even thoughts about words are included beca
use words are sounds; they’re part 
of the sound base.  All these things are part of 
kama 
", part of the five-sense world.  "
Approving of those things is what keeps them interf
ering with your meditation.  When 
we are trying to watch the breath and feelings come
" up in the body, it’s because we’re "
approving of the mind going out to the body.  We’re
 consenting to it.  We’re allowing 
it to happen. 
One of the great antidotes to desire is 
!!
" or turning away, repulsion or revulsion "
to that world.  The Buddha gave some very meaningfu
l similes for 
kama 
", the "
world of sensory desire.  One of my favourite simil
es is the one about a bone smeared 
with blood and tossed to a hungry dog.  That’s so a
pt for the sensory world.  If we pay 
236
"attention to the sensory world, we get a taste of c"
omfort just for a moment.  We 
scratch the itch and it feels good for a moment but
 it doesn’t solve the underlying 
"problem.  In the same way, when the dog gets a bone"
" smeared with blood, it licks it "
"and it tastes as if it’s a full meal, as if it’s re"
"al meat.  Of course, it only gets the taste "
and then there is no real sustenance.  There is no 
"body to it, nothing that gives the "
fulfilment of its promises. 
It is the same with sensory desire.  In its grosses
t form in the world – whether it’s 
"sexuality, food, or whatever else you desire – it n"
ever gives you satisfaction.  Don’t be 
a person who roams the world looking for the next b
one smeared with blood.  We go 
"here or there and we get a bone smeared with blood,"
 ‘Oh that’s not the right one’.  We 
go to another monastery and taste that.  That’s not
 the right one either.  We are always 
"running around looking for the real meat, but we ca"
n’t find that real meat in the 
sensory world.  The 
"suttas"
 say we only reap weariness and disappointment.  So
 all the 
weariness and disappointment that comes up in our l
ife is because we are trying to go 
"for a blood-smeared bone, not the real, full four-c"
ourse meal which we get when we 
give up those things. 
Another fascinating simile is the simile of a man c
limbing a tree to get some fruit.  
While he is up in the tree getting the fruit anothe
r man comes along also wanting fruit 
and chops the tree down.  So even if it is unintent
"ional, when you go for the sensory "
"world, just by its very nature it is going to hurt "
and bring you pain. 
Last night I gave a talk about conflict in the worl
d.  Basically there is no end to 
conflict in the world.  That’s what the world is ab
out.  Trying to resolve conflict in the 
world is impossible.  To limit conflict is possible
", but to stop it completely is not.  As "
"the saying goes in English, ‘you can’t make a silk "
purse out of a sow’s ear’.  

"is like that, and that’s why the Buddha taught the "
Four Noble Truths.  The first Noble 
Truth is suffering or unsatisfactoriness; the idea 
is to get out of 

", get out of "
conflict by not getting re-born again.  Once we’re 
born we have conflict:  we have 
"arguments with people, we have conflict with the we"
"ather, we have conflict with the "
"food, or the food has conflict with our stomach.  T"
here are all sorts of conflicts going 
"on in the world.  I had a stomach ache today, so I "
know about conflict with food – 
237
that’s par for the course. 
Understand that the sensory realm is dangerous.  Ev
en if people have no intention to 
"hurt, harm, cause you problems, or irritate you, it"
’s just the nature of the sensory 
"world.  If we climb up into that tree, sooner or la"
"ter, someone with no bad intentions "
towards us is going to cut us down and almost kill 
us.  We sometimes get angry with 
others or have ill-will towards others because we t
hink that people are doing this on 
purpose.  They don’t do these things on purpose.  I
t’s just a result of being in the 
"world.  There are no bad intentions, it just happen"
s.  This is the nature of the sensory 
world:  it’s dangerous! 
If we play around in the world we are going to get 
into trouble.  Understanding that 
"gives us aversion, "
!!
.  It gives us aversion and disgust towards that wo
rld and for 
‘gnawing at the bones’ which promise you so much bu
t give so little.  Aversion to the 
sensory world is not just towards the physical body
".  To turn away from the body, to "
get 
!!
" towards it, we practise "
"
!"
.  But there’s also the aversion towards 
sound and all the things you hear from other people
", the praise and blame – we have "
!!
 towards both.  We have 
!!
" towards sights, smells, and tastes, towards all "
this food that we have.  It’s such a problem! 
"I remember years ago, a friend of mine said, “Would"
n’t it be great if we could get 
some ‘astronaut food’”.  He had heard that ‘astrona
ut food’ was just a few pills.  You 
"took one for protein, one for vitamins, and one for"
 carbohydrates.  We would just 
need to take the pills rather than having all these
" different types of food, which needs "
"to be cooked, prepared, set out and then eaten.  It"
" would be great, wouldn’t it, if we "
could just take pills once a day?  It would be grea
t!  Monks taking bowls to the people 
"who are on retreat wouldn’t have so much to carry, "
"just a little medicine bottle, "
“here’s your 

 for today”.  It would be wonderful because it take
s away all the 
problems that go with tastes.  That would turn us a
way from the world of food.  We 
would not be concerned about it.  We would just put
 food in our bowl and eat it.  We 
see things and we leave them alone.  We turn away f
rom all of that. 
!!
", which is revulsion to that world, is the way of t"
urning off those five senses.  
238
Instead of having 
kamachanda
 we have 
kama!!
.  
)!!
 turns us away 
from that world.  How long have we lived in that wo
rld?  What has it ever given us?  
What we’ve got from that world are just problems.  
It gives us all sorts of problems:  
"old age, suffering, and death, again and again and "
again. 
"If I’ve ever given you a problem, don’t blame me; i"
ts 
kama
", the sensory world, that’s "
given you the problem.  If it’s our body that is gi
"ving problems, it’s not sickness, its "
kama
", the sensory world.  "
Having 
!!
 to the sensory world is the antidote to the 
hindrances
.  Not only will it stop us indulging in thoughts a
bout things of the past and 
"in the experience of the senses now, but it will al"
so stop us making plans about them.  
Why do we actually do any planning?  Because we thi
nk that we can control that 
world and gain happiness.  That is a hopeless task.
  The whole thing stinks.  Just 
throw it all away.  We needn’t worry about of the f
"uture, because we know it’s going "
to be bad.  The future is not going to give us much
 happiness.  It’s just going to be 
"more trouble, with more problems.  "
Being an abbot I don’t control anything.  To try ju
"st gives me more trouble, more "
"problems.  Being the second monk, the third monk, o"
r a junior monk is just more 
"trouble, more problems in the sensory realm.  So do"
n’t ever plan or think about the 
future when you’re meditating.  Have 
!!
 towards all of that.  We should also 
develop 
!!
 towards food.  We only eat because is sustains the
" body, because it’s "
our duty to keep the body reasonably healthy.  Foll
ow the middle way – the Buddha’s 
way! 
When we have 
!!
" towards the five senses, they are very easy to tur"
n off.  This 
"means that when you are meditating, feelings in the"
 body don’t come up so easily.  
We’re fed up trying to get this body into a nice po
sition.  This insight came to me 
early on in my monastic life.  I didn’t know anythi
ng about it when I was a lay 
"meditator.  As a monk meditator, I was sitting down"
 and my legs went to sleep.  I had 
pins and needles.  Every time that happened I would
 move and destroy my meditation.  
Finally one day I decided I’d had enough of this.  
I had 
!!
 towards always 
having to change position because of my legs going 
to sleep.  I decided it doesn’t 
matter if gangrene sets in or whatever.  I’ll just 
sit still.  To my amazement I had 
239
"called the body’s bluff, and the blood started flow"
ing again.  The pins and needles 
disappeared by themselves. 
"At other times, people, have called the bluff of th"
e body.  Sitting there with aches and 
"pains, they just forget about it and then get into "
deep meditation.  Afterwards the 
aches and pains aren’t there any more.  These aches
" and pains in the body, are they "
really aches and pains or are they a product of the
 mind?  When we are in 
samadhi
 we 
can sit meditation for hours and there are no aches
 and pains at all.  If we sit there for 
an hour or an hour and a half without 
samadhi
", the body aches and is stiff.  What’s "
going on?  After a while we lose confidence that th
e body always tells the truth.  We 
"lose confidence that the eyes tell the truth, that "
the ears tell the truth.  We lose 
confidence that the nose or the tongue tells the tr
uth.  We have 
!!
 towards all of 
that.  That means that these things no longer inter
fere with us.  A sound comes up and 
we are not concerned.  We turn away from those thin
gs.  The same thing happens with 
"ill-will, the second hindrance, when it comes up. "
Ill-Will and Anger 
Ill-will is such a foolish hindrance; it’s a crazy 
hindrance.  I don’t know why people 
actually get bothered with ill-will.  What does it 
ever do for you?  If someone upsets 
"you, says something you don’t like, or does somethi"
"ng that you don’t approve of, why "
allow them to give you a bad day?  We don’t have to
 allow them to spoil our 
happiness.  Even if we have ill-will towards someon
"e else, what does that actually "
achieve?  It’s just looking for revenge:  ‘They hur
t me and therefore I’m going to hurt 
"them’.  So we go around planning, making waves, try"
"ing to upset them, or put them "
"down.  So much of speech, especially in confrontati"
"ons, is just trying to give another "
person a bad day.  Ill-will doesn’t really help any
body.  If someone else has done 
something 
"wrong, "
if 
they 
really 
have 
broken 
their 
p
recepts 
or 
done 
something 
"inappropriate, it’s their problem, their "
kamma
’s
 problem.  We don’t have to have ill-
will towards them.  
)
 will sort everything out
! 
"When we see ill-will, we see that it’s wasting so m"
uch time in our life.  We haven’t 
"much time to practise this path, but right now on a"
" meditation retreat, we’ve got the "
best time of all.  There are not many distractions 
for us.  So why waste time with the 
240
"distraction of ill-will?  Outside, when we are not "
"on retreat, we are always "
doing 
things
 and there is even less time to meditate.  So why w
aste even a second with ill-
will?  It’s craziness.  I think the Buddha describe
"d it as a sickness.  With that sickness, "
there is no way you can get any wisdom.  There’s no
 way that you can get happiness 
or any concentration in meditation.  So put ill-wil
l aside.  Use your insight and your 
intelligence to see that ill-will gets you nowhere.
  Just put it aside.  Have revulsion 
towards ill-will.  Reflect on just how much time it
"’s wasted for you, how it’s tortured "
"you, how it’s made you sick and weak, and then allo"
w it to disappear. 
"Of course, ill-will goes very deep.  It’s ill-will "
that stops us having happiness.  It 
doesn’t allow us happiness.  Ill-will can be very a
ggressive.  There’s a story about the 
anger-eating demon.  I’m not going into the details
 here because you have probably 
all heard it so many times before.  If we give the 
"demon anger or aggression, it gets "
stronger.  To clear some of the defilements we ‘sla
"p them around a bit’, but if we try "
that with ill-will it gets even worse.  Ill-will co
mes from a sense of self.  So it’s ill-
will towards ill-will.  That’s not the way to deal 
with it.  The Buddha said 
#Metta
 or 
loving-kindness is the way to overcome ill-will.  T
he monks on the River Vaggumuda 
doing 
"
!"
meditations got into so much ill-will towards thems
elves that they 
"committed suicide.  The Buddha had to say, “Monks, "
that’s the wrong way.  Balance 
your practise”.  
"
!"
 meditation is great for reducing and suppressing s
ensory 
"desire, "
but ill-will needs loving-kindness
.  Ill-will needs the softness of the mind and 
that has to be looked at in one’s meditation. 
Often people can’t get into deep meditation not bec
ause of ill-will towards others but 
because of ill-will towards themselves or ill-will 
towards the meditation object.  What 
"that means is that when we are meditating, for inst"
ance when we are watching the 
"breath, we have ill-will towards the breath.  In ot"
"her words, we’re going to ‘conquer’ "
the breath.  We are going to use our ‘macho’ power;
" we think, ‘I’m stronger than "
"you’.  So we grab hold of the breath, like a bounce"
r at a night club.  We’re going to 
capture the breath and we’re going to keep hold of 
it.  That aggression is ill-will.  We 
"may be able to hold the breath for a short time, bu"
t because of 

" (impermanence), "
as soon as we loosen our grip the breath is going t
o ‘run away’.  It will run fast and 
not come back.  The stress of that practice will ne
ver allow the mind to settle down.  
241
That’s why in meditation it is good from time to ti
me to practise some loving-
kindness.  I don’t mean by doing the ‘may all being
"s be happy’ as a verbal exercise, "
but by remembering what loving-kindness means.  Bri
nging loving kindness up into 
the mind softens the mind.  By directing that mood 
"of loving-kindness onto the breath, "
we are meditating on the breath with 
#Metta
.  
'#Metta
 and 
anapanasati
 just come together 
"as one.  We are watching the breath so softly, and "
we find that the breath will just stay 
there.  We are not trying to grab hold of it; we ar
e not holding it down with force.  
We’re 
not fighting 
the 
breath like 
a 
soldier; 
we 
ar
e 
being 
compassionate 
like a 
"Buddha.  With that compassion, that kindness, that "
"softness, we find it’s much easier "
to hold the breath and much easier to develop deep 
meditation. 
"One time, at the start of a weekend meditation retr"
"eat, I was very tired from all of the "
"work I had done during the week, and from all the e"
"ffort of getting to the retreat, and "
from giving the introductory talk.  After the talk 
"I thought, ‘okay, now is the time that "
I can do some meditation’.  It was marvellous to pu
t 
#Metta
 onto the breath and I had a 
wonderful deep meditation.  I even dreamt of that d
eep meditation during the night.  I 
got up in the morning and the 
Citta
 was right there as soon as I woke up.  It’s a 
marvellous experience to put loving-kindness togeth
er with the breath.  It was obvious 
"that evening, maybe because of my tiredness, that m"
y hindrance was ill-will.  But I 
spotted it and gave it the antidote of 
#Metta
 with amazing results. 
When we can see these hindrances and actually apply
 the right antidote it’s amazing 
what happens.  The only real way we can know if it 
is ill-will is to try using 
#Metta
.  If 
"it works we know, ‘yes, that was ill-will’.  After "
that we know how very subtle the 
hindrance of ill-will can be.  We only know through
 the practice of 
#Metta
.  I couldn’t 
really see the ill-will I had that evening.  I coul
dn’t recognize it as ill-will.  I just had 
the intuition to do loving-kindness meditation and 
it worked.  Sometimes ill-will 
manifests 
and 
you 
just 
can’t 
notice 
it. 
It’s 
almos
t 
invisible. 
If 
the 
meditation 
immediately goes deeper by the use of loving-kindne
"ss, then you know, ‘yes, that was "
ill-will’.  Some of these hindrances are so subtle 
they are like an invisible man or a 
ghost that blocks the way.  They are so refined and
 so subtle we can’t really see them 
blocking the way.  The remedies that the Buddha gav
e are the ones that work. 
242
Sloth and Torpor 
"Sloth and torpor are negativity, trying to escape t"
hrough sleep.  I used to visit the 
prisons.  Prisons are very unpleasant places for pe
ople to stay in.  One of the common 
"phrases one heard was, “an hour of sleep is an hour"
 off your sentence”.  Here an hour 
of extra sleep is an hour of wasted opportunity.  S
loth and torpor shows us that we are 
really not enjoying what we are doing.  There is no
 happiness in our practice.  
"
!"
"practice, the aversion to things, can quite easily "
"lead to sloth and torpor, unless you "
develop 
"
!"
 meditation to the point where is arouses 
"
"
.
  But be careful 
"with that.  If it arouses negativity, the mind will"
 be inclined to go into sloth and 
torpor. 
"If you enjoy meditating, after a while, energy aris"
es in the mind.  Don’t always look at 
the clock.  Look at the present moment instead.  Cl
ocks can create sloth and torpor.  
"“It’s ten o’clock, it’s eleven o’clock, it’s my bed"
"time now”, and we start to yawn.  If "
"we don’t look at the clock, who knows what time it "
"is?  Once, when I was a lay "
"person, I went to the far north of Norway in the Ar"
tic circle.  It was light nearly all 
day and night.  In twenty-four hours it never chang
ed much and that really confused 
me.  I didn’t know the right time to sleep.  It wou
ld be marvellous to have all the 
monks go up there for the Rains Retreat.  We would 
find we would have extra energy.  
Why sleep when it’s light?  We would only sleep whe
n the body told us it’s really 
"tired, not just because it’s dark or because it’s o"
ur bedtime. 
"One reason why, in this monastery, we don’t have mo"
"rning and evening meetings, is "
because I don’t want you to be the prisoners of clo
cks.  I want you to be free of that.  
"So when the meditation is going well, just go for i"
"t!  And then when it’s time to rest, "
just rest.  Remember though that sometimes if we pu
"sh ourselves too much, we just "
get into sloth and torpor.  It’s much better if a p
erson has clarity of mind and not so 
"much meditation, than to have hardly any sleep and "
have a dull mind all day.  Be 
careful with that.  I’ve been through that myself. 
 If we try to cut down on sleep to the 
"point that, when we get up in the morning we just n"
"od off or we fall asleep sitting up, "
"then we’re not getting enough sleep.  Also, be care"
"ful not to have too much sleep, "
"because here again, that leads to sloth and torpor."
"  Get the right amount of sleep, the "
"right amount of food, the right amount of exercise,"
 and the right amount of happiness 
in your life.  Then you won’t have too much sloth a
nd torpor.  Negative people often 
243
have sloth and torpor while those with a positive a
ttitude have energy. 
"If you have sloth and torpor, bring up happiness.  "
Happiness is energy
.  Bring up a 
happy or joyful object into the mind.  If you enjoy
" chanting, chant.  If you enjoy "
"walking, walk.  If you enjoy sitting, sit.  If you "
"enjoy reading, read.  I’m not talking "
"about sensory enjoyment, so don’t go thinking about"
 women.  I won’t tell you who it 
"was, but one of the monks in a monastery in Thailan"
d did that and he said he had no 
"sloth and torpor, no restlessness at all.  But that"
’s not the way to overcome those 
hindrances.  One hindrance is just being substitute
d by another one.  Bring up a 
wholesome object that brings happiness and joy. 
One of my favourite reflections is on 
"all the sacrifices, and all the goodness that I "
have done
.  One monk reminded me today of all the wonderful 
people who came for 
my birthday.  He said that they came because I’d do
ne something for them.  I had 
given them something.  That was why they came.  It 
was my 
&
", my generosity, my "
giving that caused that.  So we can reflect upon th
at instead of on being negative.  
"Last year I thought, ‘why is my birthday during the"
 rains retreat?  It’s really unfair.  
Why can’t it be some other time when we’re busy any
way?’  I should have had a 
more positive attitude and that would have given me
" energy, but I forgot to do that.  "
"So I was negative to my birthday.  Next time, I’ll "
"reflect, ‘isn’t it wonderful that so "
many people come.  They give so many wonderful birt
hday cakes’.  That positive 
energy brings up happiness and joy to overcome slot
h and torpor.  Anything that gives 
joy energises the mind. 
Restlessness and Remorse 
When we get to 
"


"
", the restlessness of the mind, we are all familiar"
with this one.  We are meditating and the mind goes
 backwards and forwards.  We try 
to make the mind stop thinking and going here and t
"here, but it just won’t settle down.  "
Restlessness is very close to ill-will.  But if we 
really look deeper we’ll find that the 
mind has got into fault-finding and lack of content
ment.  That word ‘contentment’ is 
so powerful.  If loving-kindness doesn’t work then 
just try developing contentment.  
They are very close to each other.  Contentment say
"s to the anger-eating demon, "
"‘Demon, you can be here as long as you like’.  If t"
he mind is running backwards and 
"forwards, allow it to run backwards and forwards.  "
"Tell the mind, ‘you can run "
244
"wherever you want mind, I’m completely content’.  T"
hat takes away the force that 
keeps 
the 
mind 
moving. 
What 
is 
that 
force? 
It’s 
a
lways 
discontent: 
wanting 
"something else, "
"wanting to be somewhere else, and n"
ever really 
wanting 
what’s 
happening here and now.  We have judged what we are
 doing to be wrong.  The mind 
is wandering all over the place and we think that i
s not good enough.  But by 
"developing contentment, we see that’s okay.  So jus"
t leave it.  What arises passes 
away.  The mind will slow down by itself eventually
. 
Contentment is undermining the ‘doer’ and that’s ve
ry difficult to see.  When we 
"apply contentment more and more, when we apply it d"
"eeper and deeper, we find that "
it is an incredibly powerful tool for getting into 
deep 
samadhi
".  So, when we’re "
"watching the breath, we’re just content to be with "
"this rough old breath, which we’re "
on now.  We’re absolutely content.  We don’t want a
"nything else in the whole world, "
ever.  All we want is just to be here now with this
 rotten old breath.  Try that.  
It is 
called 
‘letting 
go’
. 
Full 
contentment 
is 
like 
climbing 
onto 
the 
bus 
a
nd 
letting 
"everything just happen.  The ‘doer’, the thing crea"
"ting the problem, has been seen.  "
‘
'
", I know you.  You’re just discontent and fault fin"
ding.  I’m not going to follow 
you.  I’m not going to buy into you whatever you wa
nt to do.  Be off with you.’  That 
tells M

"ra he’s been seen, and he slinks away with shoulder"
"s hunched saying, “the "
monk knows me”.  That metaphor means that the distu
rbance ‘slinks’ away with 
"‘shoulders hunched’, and the mind settles because o"
f contentment.  There is no reason 
to make the mind move. 
It’s like Ajahn Chah’s simile of the leaf flutterin
g in the tree – we’ve removed the 
wind.  
"Contentment has removed the wind of discontent, of "
doing
.  When that wind 
"has been removed, little by little the leaf flutter"
s less and less.  The mind settles down 
and so does the breath and before we know it we’re 
just watching the ‘beautiful 
breath’.  We’re so content to be with the ‘beautifu
"l breath’, and that contentment "
becomes the inclination of the mind.  It becomes es
tablished in the mind.  We are so 
content that the ‘beautiful breath’ turns into a 
Citta
", but we don’t care.  We’re "
content if the 
Citta
 comes or if the 
Citta
" goes.  However long it wants to stay, "
it can stay.  We’re so content we’re not forcing th
e issue.  We’ve let go and we’re not 
driving the meditation.  Because of that contentmen
"t, the "
Citta
 doesn’t move.  
245
Because it doesn’t move it builds up more and more 
energy and we get into the first 
jhana
.  Contentment still keeps on working to overcome 


and then one 
has the full contentment of the second 
jhana
.  That’s how far contentment can take 
"you.  It’s a powerful antidote to restlessness, to "
"that which moves the mind, and that "
which makes it wobble in the first 
jhana
. 
So the antidote to restlessness is just knowing tha
t we are finding-fault and being 
critical.  Monks who are always critical – always f
"inding fault with the monastery, "
"with other people, with this or with that – should "
know that they will never find 
contentment in the world.  They’ll go to another mo
"nastery, but they’ll take the fault-"
"finding mind with them, and they won’t be content t"
here either.  Even if they could 
find the Jeta Grove and the Buddha was sitting ther
"e, they would say, “Oh, he’s just "
"an Indian!”  It’s that fault-finding mind, which is"
 the opposite of contentment. 
Real 
contentment 
has 
a 
feel 
to 
it. 
When 
we 
practis
e 
contentment 
often 
in 
the 
"meditation, it becomes not just a word, it becomes "
a whole territory in the mind.  It’s a 
"territory, a place, a path, that leads to deep medi"
"tations.  It’s a very, very beautiful "
"word.  The more we reflect upon it, the more we all"
"ow it to lead us, the more we will "
know how powerful it is as a path into the deep med
itations.  It also shows us the path 
"of an Arahant, because they are absolutely content."
The hindrance of 
"


"
","
" including remorse and worry, is very close to "
the hindrance of 

", doubt and uncertainty.  We feel remorse about thi"
ngs that 
"we’ve done, which we shouldn’t have done.  We all k"
now the way to stop that is with 
forgiveness.  Try to do your best and then just let
 it go.  Everyone makes mistakes in 
this world.  No one is perfect because the world is
"n’t perfect.  The body, feelings "
"perception, volitional formations, and consciousnes"
s aren’t perfect.  So what do we 
"expect?  Any monk, any kangaroo, is the same.  They"
" are not perfect, they are just "
khandhas
.  So forgive and let go. What’s been done is just 
‘par for the course’. 
Doubt 
+
 or doubt is the last hindrance.  It is the opposit
e of sloth and torpor; it is 
thinking 
too 
much. 
When 
you 
think 
too 
much 
you 
wil
l 
always 
have 
doubts.  
246
"Wherever there’s thinking, it goes in two ways.  It"
" could be this way, or it could be "
that way.  That’s duality.  When there’s no duality
", there is a unity of mind and then "
doubt 
cannot 
happen. 
The 
antidote 
to 
doubt 
is 
just
to 
devote 
ourselves 
to 
the 
instructions.  Sometimes doubt can come up when we 
contemplate the 
Dhamma
 rather 
than the path.  We contemplate the goal rather than
 the way to the goal.  The way to 
"the goal is quite clear.  Everybody agrees on that,"
 especially in our tradition.  But 
people have differences of opinion on what is actua
lly seen when we get there. 
It’s a waste of time having those differences of op
inion.  We have to get there first of 
all and then see for ourselves.  So don’t waste tim
e having doubts about the goal and 
about what’s going to be there.  You know it’s good
.  The Buddha went there and said 
that 
!!
 was a nice place to be.  So follow the path and ha
ve confidence that this 
is the path of the 
Ariyas
.  It’s the path you see in the 
"suttas"
.  It’s the path that leads to 
!!
".  It’s a gradual path, which means it gradually ge"
"ts better and better, more "
"and more powerful, happier and happier, more and mo"
re profound.  We have the 
feeling that we are getting closer and closer to so
"mething that is very amazing, very "
wonderful and liberating.  We are getting closer an
d closer to what we’ve always 
"wanted.  The more we meditate, the closer we get an"
d the surer we are that this is the 
path.  
+
" is overcome gradually through practising, through "
the experience of 
what’s happening.  When eventually we get our first
 experience of a 
jh

na
", all the "
doubt about what we need to do is usually abandoned
.  We actually see what’s going 
"on with this mind and body, and all doubt goes.  We"
 know what to do.  There is no 
"messing around, no wobbling, no faltering, and no h"
esitation.  This is what we’ve got 
to do.  
So get in there and do it
! 
Conclusion 
These are the five hindrances to our meditation pra
ctice.  Whatever is stopping us 
from enjoying the deepest meditation has to be one 
of these five hindrances or a 
"combination of them.  If it’s a combination, one of"
 them will be prominent.  So don’t 
"mess around:  know the obstacle, know the remedy, a"
nd apply it.  In applying the 
remedy you will also be 
practising recollection of 
or reflection on the 
Dhamma
(
"
"
).  The reason why 
"
"
 leads to deep insight is because 
"there are refined forms of craving, refined forms o"
f 
"
"
" or attachment, and the "
247
five hindrances are manifestations of all these thi
ngs.  People in the world say all sorts 
of foolish things about what 
"
"
" is, what craving is.  But here we’re seeing "
through bare experience what these things are.  We’
"re not just reading the menu, we "
taste the food.  We see what craving is and how per
"nicious it is, how difficult it is to "
track down.  
0
 is really slippery but once we actually see throug
h it that leads 
to the eradication of the five hindrances.  Each on
e of these five hindrances is a 
manifestation of craving.  Once we actually see tha
"t, we understand how craving is so "
deep and why it is so hard to uproot.  The only way
 to uproot craving and attachment 
"is through the practise of The Eightfold Path, culm"
inating in the 
jhanas
. 
These are the insights we get through contemplating
 the five hindrances.  We know 
the five hindrances completely.  We know the antido
"tes and we become one who, as it "
says in the 
"suttas"
", can enter the "
jhanas
" with ease, with no difficulty, with no trouble.  "
"We know the way in, we know the obstacles, and we k"
now the remedies.  Why should 
there be any difficulty?  We’re focussing on the pr
actice that leads to 
jhana
 and on the 
way 
we’re 
gaining 
some 
very 
powerful 
insights 
into 
the 
nature 
of 
craving 
and 
"
"
. 
So please bear these words in mind.  May they bear 
fruit in your practice.

Ā
RA 
25
th
 August 2004 
Almost a month of the rains retreat has gone.  When
 it comes to the opportunity for 
practise it doesn’t get any better than this.  We s
hould recall the opportunities that we 
have and put everything we’ve got into the practice
".  Whatever duties you have to do, "
"do them thoroughly, and when there’s nothing to do,"
 then do nothing.  Sit in your hut 
"or walk on your meditation path, and enjoy the free"
dom of having to do nothing. 
We have to go in the direction of working and meeti
ng our responsibilities so often 
that sometimes we just aspire and long for the oppo
rtunity to practise.  In a monastery 
"such as this, which is so well established, so well"
" supported, and so well looked after "
there’s nothing much we have to do.  So when you ar
e in your hut and have this 
"opportunity, make sure that you put great effort in"
to doing nothing. 
Controlling and Wanting 
Too many people still do things.  You only have to 
look at the 
sutta
 we are going to 
"chant next week, the "
 
"Sutta"
" (SN 22.59), to see that each of these "

 (aggregates) – 

", the body; "
#
", the feelings, pleasure and pain; "
Panna
", "
your 
perceptions; 
$
", "
"mental-formations, "
your 
will; 
even 
**
", "
consciousness – is out of your control.  There is 
no
 self in there that controls these 
things.  The Buddha said in the 
 
"Sutta"
 that if any of the 

 were 
"a self, you would be able to say, “Oh, may my consc"
"iousness be like this.  Oh, may it "
"not be like that.  Oh, may my feelings be such.  Ma"
y my pleasure and pain not be like 
that.”  The Buddha said we cannot do that because t
here is no self; it is all 
Metta
 (non-
"self), and we do not control those things.  It’s a "
powerful statement!  The Buddha said 
we should reflect upon the truth of 
Metta
 again and again. 
We 
may 
not 
personally 
have 
seen 
Metta
", "
but at 
least 
we can 
have 
faith 
in 
the 
Buddha’s 
"teachings, "
clearly 
repeated 
so 
many 
"times,"
that 
the 
five 

are 
nothing to do with us.  They are out of our control
".  So why, when we meditate, do we "
try to control these things?  Why do we try pushing
 and pulling the mind to be just as 
"we want it to be, to get rid of this, and to get ho"
ld of that?  Surely we should have got 
249
the message by now.  It states in the 
"suttas"
" that the more one controls, the more one is "
going against the Buddha’s advice.  So our path of 
practice is to be able to sit down 
"and learn what it means to be able to let go, to go"
 in the opposite direction of the 
asava
", (the out-flowings of the mind), and to just sit a"
nd be patient. 
The problem is that people don’t know how to be tru
ly patient.  Whenever you are 
"sitting down doing nothing, you want something.  Cr"
"aving and desire come up, and "
they 
take 
you 
away 
from 
this 
"moment, "
and 
prevent 
yo
u 
from 
going 
inwards.  
"Remember, "
wanting 
is that force 
which takes you 
awa
y 
from 
whatever you 
are 
experiencing now
", into something in the future, into fantasies or d"
reams.  According 
to the 
"
"
"Sutta"
 the 
jhanas
" and Enlightenment, are always different from what "
you imagined them to be.  ‘

’ (MN 113).  
"So, how can you actually want anything, if you are "
not sure what it is that you want? 
We have the simile from the 
"suttas"
  of the person who has fallen in love with the mos
t 
"beautiful girl in the country, but he doesn’t know "
"what she looks like, or where she "
"lives, what her name is, or even if she exists.  So"
"me monks, novices, and "
&
 in 
this monastery have already fallen in love with 
Citta
 and 
jhanas
", even when they "
"don’t know what they are, where they are, or whethe"
r they even exist or not.  So why 
are you craving for something that you don’t know? 
" Leave all that alone.  Let it go, "
"until there is no wanting at all, so that the mind "
"is content, still, and peaceful.  Your "
whole job in this meditation retreat is just to be 
"peaceful, to be still.  Make that your "
goal.  Not 
jhanas
", not "
Citta
", not Enlightenment.  Make it your goal to be as "
"peaceful as you possibly can, to lessen those desir"
"es, to stop the mind moving and "
keeping the mind still to stop the mind being distu
rbed by you getting in control and 
wanting things.  Remember that the greatest control
ler of all is 
'

" realm.  It is the realm where ‘will’, "
#
", "
"has power over others’ creations, others’ "
Citta
.  It is almost like the realm of 
control freaks.  Know that control freak within you
rself; understand that 
'
 is the 
‘doer’ inside you.  He’s always trying to push and 
"pull you, saying, “Come on; don’t "
"get so sleepy”.  “Come on, put forth some effort”. "
" “Come on, get into a "
jhana
”.  
250
"“Come on, who do you think you are?”  “Come on, how"
" long have you been a monk, "
how long have you got left of your retreat?”  “Come
" on, get going.”  That is "
'
!  In 
"answer say, “I know you "
'
"”, and then M"

ra disappears.  If you don’t know 
'
", "
"if you don’t know the control freak within you, the"
n you will always get tense and 
frustrated. 
"You can practise for years and years, and get very "
"close to your goal, because "
'
gives you a few crumbs every now and again.  But yo
u will never get a full meal you 
will never get into the 
jhanas
.  Remember that the 
jhanas
 are the places that 
'
"can’t go, where "
'
 is blindfolded.  These are the places where 
'
 is banned.  
Why?  Because anyone who has experienced a 
jhana
 knows that in those stages there 
"is no control left:  the potential to ‘do’ is gone,"
 and that potential to ‘do’ is 
'
".  So, "
are you 
giving 
'
 an opportunity 
when you are meditating?  Are 
you t
aking 
"control, trying to steer this meditation, do it thi"
"s way, do it that way?  If you are, you "
will find that you don’t get peaceful. 
I answered a question in the interviews by saying t
hat we know we are going in the 
right direction if we 
"relax, if it leads to peace, "
"to a sense of freedom, to inner "
happiness.  The Buddha’s advice to 
0 
 and 
'
", the first "
".
"
", was "
that if the training leads to things like dispassio
n and 
"
"
", you know it is the "
Dhamma
", the truth, the "
+
.  This beautiful word 
"
"
" means peace, quietness, "
stillness.  When things settle down and there is no
 more business that is 
"
"
.  
"You can understand what that really means, because "
"when you are meditating, you "
"experience that peace, that "
"

"
".  The happiness of peace, just being still; "
"there is nothing to do, and there are no burdens.  "
"You are resting not just the body, but "
"also the mind.  Then you know:  this is the path, t"
his is the 
Dhamma
 and the 
+
 of 
the Buddha.  The Buddha made it very clear that wha
t leads to peace is the 
Dhamma
", "
so use that as a check to make sure you are going i
n the right direction.  See how 
peaceful you can become.  Don’t just see how much y
ou can crave and how much will 
power you can develop.  Instead see how much ‘peace
 power’ you can develop. 
Giving Up Time 
251
"It sometimes happens, when you start with this way "
"of peace, that you have to go "
through dullness.  That’s just old 
kamma
"; bear with that.  It will disappear, and when "
"it disappears, you get energy.  This beautiful ener"
gy is not the restless energy which 
"comes from struggling and fighting, but a beautiful"
", peaceful energy.  When you build "
up that peace one of the great results is that you 
develop this fabulous mindfulness.  
What I am talking about is ‘super-power mindfulness
’. 
One of the ways of developing ‘super-power mindfuln
"ess’ is by what I call, ‘total "
"listening’.  Whatever you are doing, you have to be"
 totally there.  Because listening is 
an 
important 
"sense faculty, "
‘total 
listening’ 
is 
a 
great 
metaphor 
for this 
brilliant 
mindfulness. 
So 
whatever 
you 
are 
"doing, "
you 
are 
to
tally 
listening 
to 
what’s 
happening.  Even when you are practising present mo
"ment awareness meditation, you "
"are totally there, totally listening, totally feeli"
ng.  One hundred percent of the mind is 
in the moment.  When you understand the idea of wha
"t I mean by ‘total listening’, you "
also understand what this mindfulness is and how it
 becomes so powerful.  When we 
say ‘total listening’ we give it everything we’ve g
"ot, and then we find we have more "
"to give to our mindfulness, to our alertness.  We f"
"eel more deeply, we know more "
"powerfully, and then mindfulness starts to grow and"
 grow.  It grows because we are 
"not doing anything.  The mind is still, it’s not go"
ing away from ‘total listening’. 
"When we look at the concept we call time, we see ti"
me only moves because of 
"craving, "
because 
of 
doing 
things. 
When 
we 
stop 
doi
ng 
"things, "
when 
we 
stop 
"planning, when we stop hurrying and hastening throu"
"gh the rounds of rebirth, time "
stops in this beautiful timelessness.  Whenever we 
"want something, we are already "
making the future.  What is it going to be like?  W
hat is going to happen next?  Where 
are we going to go next?  And then we start going i
"nto ill will or guilt, we start "
looking into the past.  It’s all just craving or il
l will.  That’s why I say the present 
moment is the place where you will be free from tho
se things.  Once craving and ill-
"will stop, time stops, and then the idea of where w"
e are going and what we are going 
to do next just disappears.  The mind becomes still
 in time and we experience the 
beautiful timeless present. 
"Those of you who get into deep meditation, know wha"
t that feels like.  Time has no 
meaning anymore.  You sit there for hours and who c
"ares.  You don’t really know, "
252
"you don’t have a clue, that so many hours have gone"
 past.  Time has lost its meaning 
and you are free from that burden. 
'
" is the entity inside the wrist watch, inside the c"
"lock, that is ticking.  He’s trying "
"to control you.  But when we go beyond time, then "
'
 gets very worried.  He only 
"goes to such places with difficulty.  So remember, "
"when you are meditating, when you "
"are walking, whatever you are doing, to see if you "
"can allow that peace, that stillness "
in time to develop.  You don’t know what day or hou
r it is; you just get up in the 
morning and meditate.  Who cares what the time is? 
" If you are tired, you can go back "
to bed again.  Don’t count how many hours you sleep
", don’t count how many hours "
you meditate; just get rid of that time business.  
In the Bh
#
"Sutta"
 (MN 131) 
"it says, “Give up the past, give up the future”.  A"
nd the 
Dhamma
ā

" also says, “Give "
"up the past, give up the future”.  When you have gi"
"ven up the past and the future, the "
next thing to give up is the present.  Give up all 
time.  If you can start to do that – 
giving 
up 
time 
fully 
– 
reflect 
on 
what 
it 
means. 
U
se 
your 
insight 
practice 
to 
understand what timelessness truly is.  Then you wi
ll understand how freeing that is.  
"Straightaway you get a perspective, a reflection th"
at helps in your meditation:  the 
reflection of timelessness – no time. 
"So, when we are meditating, we can use these little"
" words like ‘timeless’, ‘no time’, "
"‘free of time’, ‘total listening’, ‘fully alert’, ‘"
"fully aware in this very moment’, as "
"ways to remind ourselves, and to point the way in o"
ur meditation.  Craving and ill-will 
take us away from this moment.  They take us away f
rom where we are supposed to 
"be going, which is inside of everything.  If we kee"
p being taken away from this 
"moment, then we will never gain "
jhanas
", and we will never get Enlightened.  We are "
"always going somewhere else, never right inside. "
No One in Here 
"Later in the retreat, we will start talking about t"
"he citadels of the ‘self’, the ‘knower’ "
and the ‘doer’; they’re right in the centre of this
.  To get close to them is so difficult 
because the ‘doer’ is always pushing us away.  The 
‘doer’ doesn’t want to be seen for 
"what it truly is:  just a phantom, a fake.  That’s "
why it always pushes us away so that 
253
we can’t understand it or see it as it truly is.  I
t is the same with the ‘knower’; it is so 
hard to see.  But by stillness we get to understand
 what ‘knowing’ and ‘doing’ is. 
We have to find that place where nothing moves.  We
 can understand what it is:  
timelessness is one of the places where you get the
 feeling that nothing is moving.  It 
is 
"
"
", peaceful.  Stay there, don’t do anything.  Never "
"ask your self, “What "
should I do next?”  You have lost the plot if you s
"ay that.  What we are doing now, "
that is the only question.  What we are doing now i
"s to know more fully.  Stay there, "
"be more patient.  Give up wanting, give up trying t"
o do things.  Stop trying to change 
the five 

; just leave them alone.  Stop that process of 
'
 controlling and 
"interfering; say, “"
'
", I know you!”  When "
'
" scurries away, with head bowed, "
that is when 
'
" is known to the monk, novice, "
&
", layman, or the laywoman; "
then 
'
 doesn’t control.  You are on the way to 
!!
", the cessation of all things.  "
"When this happens, you can see that things stop. "
Why do you always try to control these things?  It 
is all impermanent; it rises and falls 
despite of you.  If the world was under your contro
"l, you could actually control this "
"business of impermanence:  this night and day, thin"
"gs coming and going, happiness "
"and pleasure, dark and light.  How many times have "
you tried to control these things?  
All that happens is that it changes anyway.  It is 
"beyond you.  So, "

 means 
"uncertain, out of control; it come and goes as it w"
"ishes, without you being able to "
force it this way or that.  That’s why if you have 
"a good meditation, fine.  If you have "
"a bad meditation, fine.  Don’t blame yourself.  Don"
’t become proud because you got a 
"good meditation, thinking, “Now I can meditate”.  I"
f anyone of you have had a good 
"meditation and think, “Now I can do it”, the next m"
editation will be disappointing. 
You experience that many times because that’s the n
ature of things.  It is 

", that’s "
"all:  rising and falling, coming and going.  So sto"
p messing around!  Allow it to be.  
"Be content with the bad meditation, and be content "
with the good meditation.  As my 
"first meditation teacher said, there is no such thi"
ng as a bad meditation.  There is just a 
meditation; it goes according to its causes and res
ults.  How can you control the 
"results, when they depend on causes.  It’s just nat"
"ure, that’s all.  It’s nature doing its "
thing.  You have to be part of this and let go.  En
"joy the nature, the mind just "
254
"unfolding.  In fact, the more you let go and get ou"
"t of the way of this process, the "
"faster, more peaceful, and beautiful it becomes.  T"
"he more you get out of the way, the "
more powerful is the path.  You disappear.  You are
 just being a ‘nobody’. 
"Vanish into emptiness when you meditate, so that th"
ere’s no one in there.  You can do 
the perception of 
Metta
Panna
.  
Anatta
Panna
 is the perception that no one is in here.  
What I mean by developing these perceptions is that
 when you are on the walking 
"path, you start thinking about these things.  You u"
se your thoughts to focus your mind 
on what these things mean.  At least you have enoug
h knowledge and enough faith to 
know that there’s nobody in here.  The ‘knower’ is 
no one.  It is just a process of 
"consciousness.  When form hits the eye, there is a "
"conjunction of these two, there’s "
"contact.  With contact, there’s a sense impression,"
 that’s all.  When the mind object 
"meets mind consciousness the two come together, tha"
t’s mind contact.  From mind 
contact you get 
#
.  That’s all it is. 
"So when you understand what these things are, you s"
ee there’s nobody in here.  Even 
"if you can’t know that is true for yourself, becaus"
e you have not seen it with wisdom 
"yet, at least you’ve heard it with faith.  Try it o"
ut.  Imagine there are no other monks 
here.  Imagine that things are just not there.  Ima
gine that.  Put yourself in that 
"position, "
and 
then 
meditate 
from 
that 
perspective 
o
f 
"non-self, "
seeing 
that 
as 
an 
imaginary place where you meditate.  Start your med
itation with that perception.  
Start your walking meditation with the thought that
 there’s nobody else here.  The 
"Buddha said that the ‘controller’, the ‘doer’, the "
"‘knower’, is just a process, not a "
"person, not a thing, not a being.  So just walk, ju"
"st sit, and see what happens.  When "
"you start with that perception, that perception of "
true 
Dhamma
", it’s amazing how easy "
it is to meditate. 
It’s only because of delusion that meditation is ha
rd.  It’s only because of not seeing 
things clearly or forgetting that you get frustrate
d and lost in your meditation.  If you 
put that 
Metta
Panna
" right in the beginning, as a perspective from wher"
"e to start, then "
how can you fail in you meditation?  There can be n
o failure at all. because there’s no 
one 
to 
fail. 
So 
how 
can 
you 
even 
call 
it 
"failure, "
or 
good 
"meditation, "
or 
bad 
255
meditation? 
All 
this 
doing 
and 
measuring 
and 
contr
olling 
is 
cut 
off 
by 
that 
perspective. 
"When you train yourself to look at your meditation,"
" your walking meditation, your "
"sleeping, eating, or whatever else you do, from tha"
"t perspective, then you keep the "
"perspective of nobody in here throughout the day, "
Metta
Panna
".  When eating, it’s just "
"food going into the body, that’s all.  There’s nobo"
"dy tasting this food, just tastables "
tasted by the tongue:  the two coming together and 
making contact.  The contact 
"generates a feeling, that’s all it is.  Keep those "
perspectives.  Cold is just body feeling:  
when that body comes into contact with cold air 
#
 arises as a result.  It’s just the 
"process, that’s all.  Big deal!  Pain in the body i"
s just body consciousness and body 
object coming together.  There is contact and becau
se of that there is feeling; that’s all 
it is.  Look at life like that.  Look at each momen
t like that. 
Remember 
Metta
Panna
.
  It makes life so much easier when there is no one
 in here.  
And if you do that – 
Metta
", "
Metta
", "
Metta
"; no self, no controller, no doer, no knower, "
"nothing in there, just emptiness, just a process – "
imagine what would happen if you 
then sit down to watch the breath:  it would be so 
"easy to do, because there’s no one "
"doing it.  Just the same, too often we get involved"
 in something and we just mess it 
"up.  If we let the tree grow by itself, it grows ve"
ry well.  But if we start to mess around 
"with it, pulling it this way, bending it that way, "
"making it like this or that, we usually "
mess up.  When we get involved with nature we usual
ly mess it up.  Certainly that’s 
the case with meditation. 
When we get involved in trying to do a little bit o
"f controlling, it doesn’t go well.  If "
"you try to watch the breath with control, the breat"
h is never smooth.  When you just 
"leave the breath alone, when you are busy doing som"
"ething else, then you don’t "
control it at all and the breath is so smooth and n
"atural.  For many people, when they "
"first start breath meditation, they start by watchi"
ng the breath and they are controlling 
it at the same time.  That’s why it gets uncomforta
ble.  They can’t see themselves 
"controlling.  People have asked me, “When I watch t"
"he breath, it’s so hard and "
"painful.  When I don’t watch the breath, it’s nice "
and peaceful.  What’s going on?”  I 
"tell them that when they are watching the breath, t"
"hey are controlling it, because "
256
"they’ve got into that habit.  Whatever we watch, we"
 get involved with; we control it as 
"if it was ours.  Whatever we feel is ours, whatever"
" we sense is ours, we feel we have "
"to do something about it, we have to control it. "
"When you think, ‘This is not mine, nothing to do wi"
th me’; it is the same as the simile 
"that the Buddha gave about the grass, sticks, and l"
"eaves in the Jeta Grove (SN 35, "
101).  Somebody collects them and burns them.  Who 
cares?  Because they do not 
"belong to you, you don’t care.  It is the same with"
 your meditation.  Does your 
meditation belong to you?  Does your mind belong to
 you?  Does your 
#
", will or "
consciousness belong to you?  Can’t you look at you
r mind and the body like the 
grass and leaves outside?  They don’t belong to you
.  They are not yours. 
"So, why are you striving so hard in this meditation"
?  What are you doing?  Who is 
doing it and why?  When you actually look at it fro
m the perspective of 
Dhamma
", "
from 
Metta
Panna
", you can understand what your mistake is.  You are"
 controlling 
things.  You are building up through striving and c
ontrolling this huge ego of a ‘self’.  
You become the meditator.  You become the one who s
trives.  You become the 
person who’s putting all this effort into your medi
"tation.  When you do that, you find "
you get frustrated because you can see that 

 is so uncertain.  Whatever you want 
"it to be, it becomes something else, something diff"
erent.  You just can’t do it.  You 
can’t succeed in your meditation.  You try for year
"s and sometimes you get it right, "
"but often you get it wrong.  So, what are you doing"
" wrong?  You are ‘doing’, that’s "
"what’s wrong.  Leave it alone, don’t do anything – "
"disengage, detach, renounce! "
Renunciation 
The second factor of the Eightfold Path is Right In
"tention, "

$
.  Right 
intention is 
#
$
", the intention to renounce.  What a beautiful word"
"that is, ‘to renounce’.  Some of you are monks, hav"
e you renounced yet?  Many 
"people say they are ‘renunciants’, but in fact they"
 have only renounced some things.  
Maybe you have renounced some things.  Maybe you ha
ve renounced TV and sex?  
There 
are 
many 
other 
things 
you 
could 
yet 
renounce.
Renounce 
your 
body.  
"Renounce your mind.  Renounce your meditation.  So,"
 just let go! 
257
"Whatever the mind wants to do, that’s fine, because"
" it doesn’t belong to me.  “Mind, "
"you are just like the twigs, grass, leaves, and sti"
"cks of the Jeta Grove, you don’t "
belong to me.  You are nothing to do with me.  You 
"are not mine, because the Buddha "
"said there is nothing that is mine, there is nothin"
g that belongs to me.” 
"If we can abandon and let go of all this, it doesn’"
t mean we just abandon meditation 
and 
sleep 
all 
day. 
We 
abandon 
sleep 
as 
well. 
We 
a
bandon 
everything. 
The 
abandonment becomes the movement of the mind that f
rustrates 
'
 the controller.  
#
 (giving up the world) is the metal stake through t
he heart of 
'
 the 
demon.  It kills 
'
", because "
'
" can’t stand renunciation.  We give up, renounce, "
"abandon.  With that renunciation in our meditation,"
 we sit there and just renounce 
"everything:  “this isn’t mine, nothing to do with m"
"e”.  That renunciation, non-doing, "
"non-controlling, takes away the movement of mind.  "
The reason why the mind is 
"restless and tired, the underlying cause of the hin"
"drances, is seen and abandoned.  The "
"hindrances just unravel.  Sensory desires, where ca"
n they come from?  Ill-will is gone.  
Restlessness is just doing things.  Worry is about 
the past.  Who cares about the past?  
That’s all gone.  Sloth and torpor just fades away 
because the cause of sloth and 
torpor is ‘doing’. 
"We are tired, we think a lot.  We do the work in th"
e office or the work of being an 
"abbot.  The more we do, the more tired the mind bec"
omes.  That is the nature of the 
"mind.  When we don’t do anything, the mind gets so "
bright.  When I am on retreat 
there are days when I just sit there doing nothing 
in the mornings and afternoons.  All 
the energy starts to build up and I can feel it.  T
hese energies build up because I am 
just sitting there doing nothing.  I just watch.  A
ll the energy of my life is just going 
into ‘knowing’. 
Be very careful not to allow any of that energy to 
go into controlling or doing 
"anything.  As an abbot, I have to do that controlli"
"ng for the rest of the day, but there is "
"a time for non-doing, non-controlling.  There is a "
time when I meditate; then I am not 
"an abbot, I am not in-charge.  That is the time whe"
n I completely let go and abandon 
everything. 
258
As the Buddha said in the 
/
"
"
" (SN 48), if we make this abandoning the "
"main thing, make it our "

", our mind state, we attain "
samadhi
", we attain one-"
"pointedness of mind.  That’s what the Buddha said, "
and the Buddha didn’t say things 
that don’t work.  We make abandoning our practice b
y abandoning the thought that I 
am 
in 
control 
of 
this 
meditation. 
We 
abandon 
all 
o
f 
this 
doing 
"business, "
this 
"measuring, this judging good and bad.  “I am going "
"to abandon all of that”, and then, "
"the Buddha says, we get "
samadhi
", we get one-pointedness of mind. "
"Try it!  It works, if you’ve got the guts to go aga"
inst 
'
.  The trouble is we still 
want to control a little bit.  We still want to be 
the one who is doing this.  We want to 
be the ‘me’ who gets the 
jhanas
".  We can’t do that, but when we disappear, get out"
 of 
"the way, give up all hope, all wanting, then real l"
"etting go, real renunciation, real "
#
", just happens.  That’s what is needed.  We can use"
Metta
Panna
 to help us 
push that letting go button.  We fill our minds wit
h non-self. 
The Buddha’s teaching in the 
 
"Sutta"
 (SN 22.59) clearly says that the 
five 

" are not mine.  So, what is this thing we are tryin"
g to control?  We are 
trying to control things that just do not belong to
 us.  Get out of the way!  No wonder 
you get frustrated.  No wonder suffering comes.  We
 are trying to control things that 
aren’t ours.  What do we expect but suffering.  We 
are doing things that are absolutely 
stupid.  This delusion is so intense with many of u
s.  You keep on meditating and then 
"you complain to me that it’s not working, and you a"
re fed up.  How stupid can you 
be?  How can there be suffering for us if we disapp
ear and there’s no one left?  It’s 
"not suffering anymore; it’s just cause and effect, "
"the world coming and going, the five "

" going around.  Now they’re happy, now they’re sad."
  There’s no mental 
suffering 
left 
when 
we 
let 
go 
and 
disengage. 
We 
di
sengage 
from 

", "
we 
disengage from the world.  The five 

 are just the world of the five 

", "
nothing to do with us; they’re 

" that’s all.  It’s just like the weather – storms, "
"rain, wind, and then sunlight and peace again.  It’"
s cold and then it’s hot again.  You 
can’t control these things.  So why don’t you shut 
up and just stop arguing with 
"nature?  Stop arguing with the nature of your body,"
 the nature of you mind.  You 
"know what I mean by arguing?  It’s the argument, wh"
"ich keeps on saying, “Come on, "
"get in there, do some meditation”.  “That’s not goo"
d enough.”  “That was a good 
259
"one.”  “Come on, the next one will be a good one.” "
" “Come on, meditate longer.”  "
“Don’t sleep so much.”  “Do it this way”.”  You are
" arguing with nature, with your "
non-self.  Forget all of that.  Abandon!  Let go!  
Sit there and do nothing and you’ll 
find that the mind does start to become still. 
Abandoning the Hindrances 
The five hindrances are the cause for the lack of 
samadhi
.
  The lack of 
samadhi
 is not 
caused by lack of effort.  For most people in the W
"est, we make too much effort.  We "
"just don’t know how to let go, how to relax.  Lack "
of 
samadhi
 is caused by the 
"hindrances being too active.  So, put your focus on"
" what those hindrances are, how "
"they are caused, where they come from and why.  The"
 hindrances are the fuel for 

", delusion.  The Buddha said that delusion does not"
" have a cause, but is fuelled "
by 
the 
hindrances. 
The 
more 
the 
hindrances 
are 
pre
"sent, "
the 
more 
delusion 
is 
"solidified, strengthened, and sustained.  So abando"
n those hindrances by abandoning 
"the underlying cause of the hindrances, which is ‘d"
oing’ and controlling coming from 
"the sense of a self, and you will find that delusio"
n vanishes.  Like the mist in the 
"morning, it just dissipates and clears.  That happe"
ns when you start abandoning 
hindrances through the reflections of 

", "
Metta
2
 and even 
"dukkha"
" (impermanence, "
"non-self, and unsatisfactoriness).  Keep those clea"
rly in your mind and the hindrances 
won’t have much of a chance. 
"When the hindrances aren’t present, there is nothin"
g between the mind and the 
jhanas
.  
You know that!  That’s what the 
"suttas"
 and the Kruba Ajahns say; you have heard that 
from me many times.  Many of you know from your own
 experience that when the 
"hindrances go, you get into deep meditation, even "
jhanas
.  So the hindrances are the 
"problem.  It’s not you, your ability or lack of abi"
lity.  It’s not that you aren’t trying 
"hard enough, or meditating hard enough.  Look at wh"
ich hindrances are present; focus 
"on them, understand them, get to know them.  They a"
re the enemy.  They are the ones 
"that need to be overcome, so understand how to over"
come them.  Craving and ill-will 
arise from doing things all the time.  Present mome
nt awareness and silence will 
undermine craving and ill-will.  When we get into p
resent moment awareness and 
"silence, craving and ill will are almost dead.  Our"
 restlessness is almost gone as well.  
"The sleepiness that many of you complain about, don"
’t worry about it.  Don’t worry 
260
about anything because worrying is just more contro
lling.  That’s old 
kamma
:  you’ve 
done too much and the mind is not bright.  Mindfuln
ess is weak simply because we 
have not been putting energy into the right place. 
 So just allow it to be.  Be with sloth 
"and torpor.  If we really leave it alone, it just v"
anishes.  It’s a marvellous experience to 
have 
that 
happening. 
Just 
be 
"patient, "
don’t 
do 
any
thing. 
Be 
kind 
and 
be 
"compassionate.  Don’t control, let go. "
The Buddha said in the 
 
"Sutta"
", “If the mind with sloth and torpor were "
"mine, then I could tell it not to be this way.  But"
" because the mind isn’t my ‘self’, I "
can’t control this mind”.  So leave it alone; allow
 it to be and don’t get involved.  
Don’t go making more delusion.  After a short while
", it’s fascinating to see sloth and "
torpor dissipate like the mist in the early morning
 or like darkness when the sun 
comes out.  You don’t have to wish the darkness awa
y in the morning.  You know if 
"you just wait, soon due to cause and effect and the"
" laws of nature, the sun will come "
up.  The sun comes up and you start to see clearly 
without your flashlight.  This is 
actually what happens with the vanishing of sloth a
nd torpor.  When this happens you 
get 
this 
"beautiful, "
peaceful 
strength 
of 
mindfulnes
s 
– 
mindfulness 
which 
doesn’t 
"move; it’s just there, just watching.  It doesn’t m"
ove because there’s no illusory self 
pushing it backwards and forwards.  This house-buil
"der – the controller, the doer, the "
"illusion of a self which thinks, “I am in control, "
I am in charge of this whole process 
of meditation” – is completely taken away. 
"Just be still, and wait in that stillness.  You are"
" not asking for anything, you are not "
"expecting anything.  You don’t want anything, becau"
se all expecting and wanting is 
the movement of the mind that takes you away from s
"tillness.  You are into peace, "
"into stillness.  If you get peace and stillness, th"
at’s good enough.  You just sit there 
"watching, and the peace will consolidate.  The stil"
lness becomes even more frozen.  
Just watch as all these stages of meditation happen
.  The stages of meditation are not 
something that we make happen.  They are just sign 
posts on a journey.  It’s just like 
when I’m sitting in the van going into town.  I don
’t do the driving; I just watch.  Now 
"we go through Serpentine, now through Byford, now t"
"hrough Armadale, now through "
Perth and into Nollamara.  They’re just stages on t
"he journey.  We watch, literally "
"doing nothing, being still one hundred per cent, be"
ing peaceful.  We see present 
moment awareness.  Now there’s silence.  We didn’t 
do that; the silence came by 
261
itself.  And then the breath comes up.  We didn’t d
o that; the breath just came.  It is 
just the territory we are passing through.  Now the
 breath is beautiful.  It’s OK.  
"That’s neat, but we don’t do anything.  Now the "
Citta
 comes up.  We never 
"looked for it, we never asked it to come; or told i"
t to go away; it just happens 
naturally.  The 
Citta
 is just so brilliant and beautiful.  Then we are i
n 
jhanas
 and 
we keep on going.  All these things just happen nat
"urally, all by themselves.  We "
didn’t do a thing.  All we did was to maintain our 
"peace.  We kept the stillness, and so "
the hindrances never had a chance.  
'
 the controller is completely confounded.  
"We went in a different direction, the direction of "
"a Buddha, not the direction of the "
world.  We went according to 
Metta
".  There’s no one in here, so how could we do "
anything?  We didn’t follow delusion; we followed w
"isdom, the path of the saints.  "
That’s how we meditate.  That’s how we get this bea
"utiful, powerful mindfulness. "
Once we get into this way of meditation it is so ea
sy.  It’s an easy thing to do with so 
much joy.  There’s no pride because there’s no self
".  There’s no saying, “I am a great "
meditator” or “I am a terrible meditator”.  There’s
 no frustration when sometimes the 
meditation doesn’t work; it’s just cause and effect
", it’s not our meditation.  You’re "
"content, peaceful, and still.  You keep doing the w"
ork which is no work.  Peacefulness 
"and stillness, these things happen by themselves.  "
It’s just like the worker who goes to 
work everyday and on Friday receives his pay packag
e.  He doesn’t expect the pay 
package every day.  Nature is that way.  You can’t 
get paid every moment.  But you 
can be at peace with every moment; you can be still
 and content with every moment.  
You can renounce doing and controlling every moment
; and confound 
'
 every 
"moment.  You just say ‘no’ to the controller, ‘no’ "
to 
'2
" and let go, do nothing.  No "
"one is in here.  There’s nothing!  That way, we can"
 really get into this meditation.  We 
find that this is so easy.  Anytime you get that po
"werful meditation, it blows your "
mind away. 
Stepping Over the Stream 
Follow that path.  Sit in your hut.  You may have b
een meditating for years and still 
"you haven’t seen it, and then suddenly you let go a"
"nd my goodness, you bliss out.  "
That is how it is.  It’s so easy!  This is how you 
get into the 
jhanas
 like the great 
"monks and nuns of old, and the great monks of today"
.  Delusion is the problem; not 
262
seeing clearly.  Sometimes people get insight and b
ecome full 

 in just one 
moment.  They get that insight after the 
jhana
", that’s the point.  Even for an "
&
", "
jhanas
 are so easy.  Why are 
jhanas
 so easy for an 
&
", let alone for an "

?  

 are easy 
for 
them 
because 
they 
see 
‘non-self’. 
Th
ey 
are 
not 
controllers 
anymore.  Ill-will and the 

 of sensory desire just disappear.  They see that t
here’s 
no one in there – no self.  That’s what makes the m
editation easy. 
Remember that this meditation of non-self has two i
mportant things that go together:  
concentration (
samadhi
) and insight (
vipassana
"), they are not separate things.  Ajahn "
Chah always said that 
vipassana
 and 
samatha
 (calm) are two sides of the same coin.  
"When we have insight and we use that insight, that "
knowledge and understanding of 
the 
"suttas"
", we recognize "
Metta
", non-self.  If there is nobody in charge, then who"
 is 
meditating?  If there is someone meditating then th
e hindrances are just around the 
corner.  You are undermining it already; you are fe
eding those hindrances.  The 
hindrances in turn are feeding the delusion and it 
keeps on going.  One day you will 
"give ‘giving up’ a try by not doing anything, just "
sitting there with no expectations 
and no measuring. 
People sometimes come to me and say they tried that
 and it didn’t work.  What do you 
mean it didn’t work?  It didn’t work because you wa
nt it to work.  Why do you want 
anything?  Give up all wanting.  Give up all these 
"expectations and this measuring, "
and then it happens.  When you don’t want something
", then it comes.  So, give it up, "
"abandon, renounce.  That’s what the Buddha said we "
should do.  You’ve heard that 
before and you know it’s true.  Stop messing around
 by trying hard.  Go back to your 
"huts, get inspired, and just sit there, and remembe"
r that there’s no one in here who is 
going to do anything.  You just stop. 
The story of the little novice comes to mind.  Ajah
n Chah was giving such a long talk 
"and the little novice thought, ‘When is Ajahn Chah "
going to stop?’  ‘The Rains 
"Retreat has been going on for four weeks, when is t"
his Rains Retreat going to end?’  
‘When am I going to get 
Citta
?’  Stop for goodness sake – stop wanting.  That 
novice stopped.  He was just a little novice who ha
d not been meditating for any 
longer than some of you.  The little novice just st
opped and went into a 
jhana
.  He 
263
came out afterwards as probably the happiest novice
 in all of Ubon.  He was blissed 
out.  He had pressed the ‘letting go button’.  If h
"e had been smart, he would have "
understood lots about 
Metta
.  He would also have understood how to ‘bliss out’
", how "
jhanas
"happen, and how to get into them. "
"All of you who are still driving your meditation, s"
teering it this way and that way with 
"your foot still on the pedal, let it go.  Our new m"
onastery car has cruise control you 
press a button and take you foot off the pedal; thi
s is like 
jhana
 meditation.  It’s all 
cruise control.  Press the ‘letting go button’ and 
take you feet off the pedals.  Then 
your car just goes smoothly along the freeway to 
!!
.  That’s what happens when 
you let go. 
"So, this is what we’re supposed to be doing.  Do it"
!  Stop!  We find that the mind goes 
into 
samadhi
" by itself; it goes in and in, because peace starts"
 to build up.  That peace 
is happiness and happiness is power.  We get into t
his ‘letting go’ business.  But be 
"careful, because sometimes if you are not used to a"
"bandoning, you can get into "
controlling again.  Some people get 
Citta
" and they think, “Wow”.  Then they try "
"to make it this way and that way, and they wonder i"
f it is the right or wrong 
Citta
.  
Stop that!  Just be at peace whatever happens.  You
" can get the most stupid, ridiculous "
Citta
", but just be at peace.  Who cares?  It’s just natu"
"re, that’s all.  Things arising, "
"things passing away, they are nothing to do with yo"
u.  So it’s just the same as the 
"grass and leaves in the Jeta Grove, they are not me"
", not mine.  Here we are just sitting:  "
"stupid and beautiful things happen in our mind, but"
 they are nothing to do with us.  
Beautiful 
Citta
" arise, but they’re not ours.  Leave them alone, an"
d then the 
Citta
" will stay with you.  If you try to own them, grab "
"them, possess them, they "
"disappear.  Leave them alone and they just develop,"
" grow, and blossom.  You will go "
"into this wonderful place of non-self, where the ‘d"
oer’ has gone and the potential to 
do has also vanished. 
The 
potential 
to 
do 
has 
completely 
vanished.  
That 
is a 
signpost 
of the 
jhanas
", "
especially 
the 
second 
jhana
. 
"Oh, "
what 
bliss! 
Nothing 
to 
do 
and 
you 
can’t 
do 
anything.  Imagine the peace and stillness – nothin
g moves.  The energies just keep 
"building up, just bliss upon bliss upon bliss.  The"
 energy of stillness is now so strong.  
264
There is just so much happiness.  That happiness is
 the power of the mind.  We come 
out of those power stages and we still maintain lot
s of power.  Want to remember past 
"lives?  It’s easy.  Psychic powers, this is where t"
hey come from.  Use that super-power 
mindfulness. 
You 
can 
remember 
what 
has 
gone 
on 
in 
your 
jhana
and 
see 
the 
"beautiful, profound teachings of the Buddha, how tr"
ue they all are.  We see how it is 
that the Buddha is such a fantastic teacher.  He ta
"ught and taught, banging on people’s "
"heads all the time, but still people often don’t se"
"e it.  There it is, in black and white, so "
"obvious and clear.  And what do people do?  “Right,"
 I am going to do Enlightenment 
"now.  Right, I am going to strive now.  I am going "
to struggle.  I am going to get this.  
"I am going to do…  I, I, I”.  Just abandon all of t"
hat silly stuff if you want to walk in 
the footsteps of the Buddha.  Otherwise you can be 
"here for 30, 40, 50, 60 years and "
still be going in the wrong direction. 
It’s just a path to Enlightenment. The Buddha’s sim
ile is crossing from this shore to 
the other shore.  This shore to the other shore is 
narrower than the stream which runs 
through our monastery.  You can step over from one 
"side to the other side, it’s so "
narrow.  The trouble is people keep going up and do
wn the banks in the same old 
direction.  Going up is wanting and craving.  Going
 down is wanting to get rid of 
"things, ill-will.  Now wanting now wanting to get r"
id of; desire and aversion; going up 
and down in the same way.  Not seeing the other way
 of going at right angles to the 
way you are used to go.  It’s a way of acting which
 you have never tried before – 
going at right angles to everything you have been c
onditioned to or done in the past.  
It’s doing something that is really original:  stop
ping.  And then we find that we can 
just step over the stream and we get into 
jhanas
 so quickly.  If you understand what 
"that step is, you understand how to let go and how "
to get 
!!
.  Do that plenty of 
times and you know that the way across the stream i
"s by abandoning, letting go, "
"renouncing, non-self, freedom, liberation. "
Conclusion 
"So, there it is for you.  Don’t mess around.  Don’t"
 do anything.  See if you can be the 
"courageous ones, the ones who do things that no oth"
er people do.  Don’t go in the way 
of the ordinary person.  Go the way of the 

 – the way of those who have 
"abandoned their ‘self’, the empty ones, those who a"
re free.

18  BETWEEN THE OBSERVER AND THE OBSEREVED 
15
th
 of June 2005 
The Buddha said that anyone who fulfils the 
anapanasati
 meditation also completes 
the four 
		
. 
 So 
that 
means 
that anyone 
who 
wants 
to 
do 
		
meditation 
can 
just 
carry 
on 
watching 
the 
breath. 
Sati		
meditation 
is 
anapanasati
 meditation.  It is useful to remember that 
anapanasati
 according to the 
Buddha 
equals 
		
. 
Even 
the 
first 
four 
stages 
of 
anapanasati
fulfil 
&
", the mindfulness of the body.  The Buddha said you"
 don’t need to do 
anymore.  But what does that truly mean? 
This 
evening 
I 
want 
to 
explore 
the 
meaning 
of 

. 
There 
are 
two 
parts 
to 
mindfulness that you should always bear in mind.  O
ne part is to understand that 
mindfulness is the power of the mind to see what’s 
going on.  It is part of the 
"brightness of the mind, the power of the mind to be"
" alert, to be aware, and to pick up "
what is going on.  Many people make the mistake of 
thinking that mindfulness is just 
"mindfulness, and they don’t understand and apprecia"
te that it has different degrees of 
intensity and power.  The normal mindfulness that p
eople carry around in their daily 
lives is so weak that they hardly see anything at a
ll.  Ordinary mindfulness is the 
mindfulness of the ordinary person going about thei
r daily business; sure they’re 
"aware, but they only see a portion of what’s out th"
ere.  One of the reasons for that is 
because their mind is not empowered yet.  It’s like
 going through life 
in semi-
darkness.  All they see are silhouettes and shapes;
" life has no texture, no detail.  "
They’ve missed too much of what’s going on out ther
e.  It’s called dullness of the 
mind. 
When you’ve experienced a 
jhana
 your mind is empowered and you understand what 
"mindfulness can be.  It’s so sharp, so penetrating,"
 that it’s like a big searchlight.  
"Whatever it looks at, it picks up everything.  I’ve"
 noticed that when I’m shaving in the 
"morning, if there is not much light, I can’t see my"
" stubble, but if there is a bright light, "
if the light in the bathroom is in the right positi
"on, I can see so much stubble on my "
"cheeks and chin.  That’s a little example of how, w"
hen there is little light you can’t 
"see what’s really there, but when you put your glas"
ses on and there is a big light you 
266
see so much detail.  It was always there but before
 you couldn’t notice it.  That 
stubble 
stands 
for 
the 
defilements; 
they 
are 
the 
st
ubble 
on 
your 
citta
making 
it 
unbeautiful and ugly. 
"So, that is the power of mindfulness.  Another impo"
rtant thing is where you focus that 
"mindfulness, where you direct it.  Some people say "
you can be mindful of anything.  
You can be mindful when you are sweeping the ground
", and when you are eating.  "
Some people even say you can be mindful of sex and 
all these other crazy ideas.  But 
this is only being 
aware
 of the object of your consciousness.  You can be a
ware of 
"sweeping, you can be aware of laying a brick, you c"
an be aware of putting food into 
"your mouth, but that is not where mindfulness shoul"
d really be put.  I’m going to be 
really controversial here.  
Mindfulness should not even be on your body
", that’s not the "
point of what we are doing. 
We all know the Buddha’s teaching on meditation if 
we read the 
"suttas"
.  According to 
the Buddha – in essence – meditation is all about o
vercoming the five hindrances – 
"suppressing them, smashing them – to get to the "
jhanas
", so that you can see the way "
things 
truly 
are. 
Meditation 
is 
suppressing 
the 
fi
ve 
"hindrances, "
but 
what 
has 
mindfulness to do with the five hindrances?  The pa
th can also be described as 
abolishing and smashing the 
 #
"; that is greed, hatred and delusion, or "
 !
", "

and 

".  The Kruba Ajahns always talk about greed, hatred"
", and delusion.  Here we "
don’t mention those things enough.  Certainly in my
 days as a young monk every talk 
"would drum it into you:  greed, hatred, and delusio"
n.  There wasn’t a talk where it 
"wasn’t mentioned ten, twenty, or thirty times. "
The Right Place for Mindfulness 
"The point is, where do greed, hatred, and delusion "
live?  Where do the five hindrances 
live?  Do they live in your body?  Do they live in 
the food you eat?  Do they live in 
the bricks you lay or in the broom or the leaves th
at you are sweeping?  This is an 
important point not only to your success as a monas
tic and to your harmony with 
"friends and other monks, but also to your progress "
in meditation.  Those hindrances 
"do not live in the broom, nor do they live in your "
citta
.  They live between you and 
those objects.  It’s that space between the observe
r and the object that needs watching.  
267
It’s not what you are doing but how you are doing i
t that is important
.  That is where 
'
 plays.  That is where the defilements live.  That 
"is the playground of greed, "
"hatred, and delusion.  Too often people put their m"
indfulness on the object or they put 
their mindfulness on the observer.  They don’t look
 at the middle – in between them – 
"at ‘the doing’, ‘the controlling’, ‘the ill will’, "
and ‘the aversion’.  That’s the reason I 
told somebody today the story of Ajahn Sumedho.  Wh
en he was first in Wat Pah 
"Pong he was having a hard time, and Ajahn Chah aske"
"d him, “Is Wat Pah Pong, "
suffering?  Is Wat Pah Pong 
"dukkha"
", Sumedho?”  Ajahn Sumedho wasn’t an Ajahn "
then.  It was of course obvious to Ajahn Sumedho th
at Wat Pah Pong is not suffering. 
"So, what is suffering?  Is the "
citta
 suffering?  The suffering was how Ajahn Sumedho 
was regarding suffering.  At that point he was addi
ng it onto the experience.  And if 
we don’t put mindfulness in its right place then we
 miss that.  We think it’s Wat Pah 
"Pong’s fault, so we want to leave that monastery.  "
We think it’s our fault so we want 
to destroy ourselves or get into a guilt trip.  Thi
s is wrong mindfulness; we’re putting 
it in the wrong place.  It’s not the monastery’s fa
"ult, and it’s not the fault of that monk "
who is upsetting you.  You are putting mindfulness 
in the wrong place if you put all of 
your focus on the object and think that is the caus
e of suffering.  If you think the way 
to find liberation is to put mindfulness on the obj
ects of your senses or to put it on 
"who’s watching or what’s watching, that will never "
get you anywhere.  We have to 
put the focus of our mindfulness on the space betwe
en the observer and the observed.  
"That’s where you find the play of greed and hatred,"
" desires and aversions, wanting "
"and disliking, and that’s where you start to make s"
omething of this world which is not 
inherent in it. 
In the very early days when the villagers had just 
"discovered generators, amplifiers "
"and loud speakers, there were big, noisy parties cl"
ose to Wat Pah Nanachat in Bung 
Wai village.  It was so loud that it would be like 
having a ‘ghetto blaster’ playing loud 
music right inside your hut.  You couldn’t sleep an
d meditation was very hard.  The 
noise would go on until three o’clock in the mornin
"g, and by the time they had "
"quietened down, that was the time the bell went for"
 you to get up.  So we hardly slept 
when those parties were on.  First of all we compla
ined to the villagers and said to the 
"headman of the village, “Look, we are monks and you"
 are supposed to be looking 
268
"after us, yet there is this loud music all night.  "
Please turn it down or at least stop at 
twelve o’clock to give us two hours sleep.”  But th
ey would never listen to us.  We 
thought they might listen to Ajahn Chah.  So we ask
"ed Ajahn Chah, “Can you please "
tell those villagers to turn the music down for a c
ouple of hours.”  They would 
"probably have listened to Ajahn Chah, but all Ajahn"
" Chah said was, “It’s not the "
"sound that disturbs you, it’s you disturbing the so"
und.”  That was a powerful teaching 
on mindfulness:  the world never disturbs you; it’s
 you disturbing the world.  It’s what 
you put in between you and the world that creates t
he problem.  It’s not the fault of 
"the world, and it’s not your fault; it’s the distur"
bance that your delusion puts in the 
middle. 
Looking at the Hindrances 
"When you put your mindfulness in the middle, then i"
t’s not what you are doing that 
"matters but how you are relating to it.  So please,"
 put your mindfulness into the 
relationship that you have with the objects of mind
 in every moment.  When you 
"know where mindfulness should be put, the path of m"
"editation, the path of Liberation, "
becomes very clear to you.  You are looking directl
y at the hindrances; you are 
looking directly at the defilements. 
Desire is your relationship between the 
citta
" and what you are experiencing, and the "
"same for ill will ‘I want, I don’t want’, craving, "
that’s where the attachments are.  It’s 
"the link, the unwholesome link that you make with t"
he objects of your mind from 
moment to moment that causes delusion to grow and g
row and grow. 
The hindrances are the food of delusion.  So it’s n
"ot what is going on in this moment, "
it’s not what you are experiencing.  But don’t misu
nderstand this to mean that you can 
be mindful of sex.  This is missing the point.  If 
you are mindful of what’s between 
"you and that act, you will see that there is cravin"
"g there, there is fear, there’s a lot of "
wanting.  If there wasn’t that wanting and that des
"ire, you wouldn’t be able to do "
"anything like that.  If there is peace, tranquillit"
"y, letting go, stillness, kindness, loving "
"kindness, there would be no possibility of that sex"
uality ever arising in your mind.  
Mindfulness is focused on the wrong thing; just lik
e Ajahn Sumedho’s mindfulness 
"when focused on Wat Pah Pong and all its faults, wa"
s focused on the wrong thing.  
269
"That’s why Ajahn Chah said, “It’s not Wat Pah Pong’"
s fault; it’s the way you are 
"relating to it, the way you are looking at it, the "
way you are regarding it”. 
I have been practising that in my life for a long t
"ime now, especially when I have to "
"do things every moment – when I have to do a job, t"
"ravel, talk to people, relate to "
"people, answer stupid questions, in particular when"
" I am tired.  Whatever it is, it’s not "
the experience that is the cause of suffering to me
", it’s how I look at it, and how I am "
relating to this thing I am being asked to do.  It’
s what’s in between the observer and 
"this thing, this task at hand.  Even this talk now,"
 it’s not the talk itself but how I am 
relating to giving this talk that I am focusing on:
  I am making sure that it is a pure 
"relationship.  The mindfulness, the awareness of th"
at can actually see where craving 
"comes from, where desire comes from, where pride co"
"mes from, where ill will comes "
from. and where fear comes from because that is its
 breeding ground.  If I’m tired 
"when I start meditating, the tiredness is the objec"
t of the mind.  It’s what is between 
me and that tiredness that matters.  Am I getting a
ngry and upset at that tiredness?  
Why am I so tired?  If you are angry or upset you a
re actually feeding the hindrances.  
It’s not the tiredness that is the problem – tiredn
ess is natural –but the disturbing of 
"the tiredness.  So, I have learned from Ajahn Chah’"
s teaching:  it’s not the sound that 
disturbs you; it’s you disturbing the sound.  The p
roblem is not that life or 

disturb you; it’s the disturbance that you put in b
etween the observer and the observed 
that is the problem. 
Once you start to look at that you find out how eas
y it is to meditate.  I don’t know 
what you do when you sit down and you close your ey
"es, but don’t just look at the "
"object in your mind, look at how you are looking at"
 it.  Are you actually creating 
"peace, are you creating freedom?  Or are you just c"
"reating more desire, more wanting, "
"more ill will, more frustration, or more fear?  Loo"
"k at where those things arise from, "
and once you get the idea of putting your mindfulne
ss in that space between the 
"observer and the observed, you will see the play of"
 all the defilements.  Where are 
they coming from?  They are coming from the stupidi
ty of the mind.  It’s only 
because you don’t look in the right place that delu
sions can grow.  Once you spot that 
area which is the cause and source of these defilem
"ents and hindrances, you can put "
your mindfulness there and see this whole process h
appening. 
270
"When you start to see that, it’s so easy.  Whatever"
" you have to experience, even if it’s "
"a sore throat right now, a disappointment, or somet"
"hing that doesn’t go right, who "
cares!  It’s not the event you have to experience; 
it’s how you are experiencing it.  So 
"even if it is pain or things I don’t like, I make s"
ure I watch between the observer and 
that unpleasant experience and put peace and freedo
m there.  I never put craving 
"there, or desire, or wanting it to be different.  I"
 never put ill will there or the thought 
“Why me?  This is not right”.  I never put control 
"there, thinking I can do something "
"about it.  It’s about ‘non-doing’, putting a piece "
of ‘non-doing’ between me and the 
object that I am looking at.  It says in the Buddha
"’s second sermon, the teaching on "
"non-self, the Anattalakkhana Sutta (SN XXII. 59), t"
hat if these objects of the mind 
"were yours to control, you could say to them, “May "
"you be like this, may you be like "
that”.  These objects are 
Metta
":  not me, not mine, not a self; “you can’t do anyt"
hing 
"about them”, said the Buddha.  So leave them alone,"
 let them go.  Whether it’s 

", "
"bodily things, material things, or whether it’s fee"
"lings, perceptions, mental formations, "
or 
"consciousness, "
leave 
them 
alone. 
They 
just 
aris
e and 
fall according 
to 
their 
"conditions.  It’s not me, it’s not mine, it’s not a"
" self; it’s just an empty process, "
"nothing to do with me.  So, I can put that freedom "
"between myself, as the observer, "
and the object. 
This is just one way of looking at it.  By saying t
he observer is not a self or an 
"essential me, and by putting that peace between the"
" observer and the observed, there "
is no possibility for the hindrances to grow.  The 
hindrances are suppressed by that 
means.  By focusing my mindfulness there rather tha
"n on my breath or whatever else, "
I’m suppressing the hindrances.  When the hindrance
"s are suppressed, especially "
"desire and ill will –the wanting, controlling, doin"
g – I also suppress all of the other 
hindrances.  Sloth and torpor always comes – as you
’ve heard me say before – 
because you have been controlling so much.  You’ve 
been doing so much your mind 
"is actually tired, and worn out.  It wants to rest;"
 it wants to turn off because it has no 
energy left.  So if sloth and torpor is in front of
 me I just put peace between myself 
and the sloth and torpor.  I do not put one of the 
first two hindrances between me and 
"that sloth and torpor; I don’t put desire, ill will"
", or fear there, and I have no sense of "
shame because I’m tired.  It’s just the body that’s
 all.  It’s just the mind that’s all.  It’s 
the five 

" doing their thing, nothing to do with me.  So I ne"
ver feel any sense 
271
of self with the sloth and torpor that comes up fro
m time to time.  I make peace with 
"it, I allow it to be, and I let it go.  I don’t fig"
"ht it, and by not fighting it I’m not "
cultivating 
the 
first 
two 
hindrances. 
Because 
I’m 
not 
cultivating 
the 
first 
two 
"hindrances, mindfulness starts to grow in intensity"
.  And because I am not feeding this 
"‘doer’, the mindfulness gets all the energy, the kn"
ower gets all the energy.  The 
"knower is mindfulness, and I’m energizing mindfulne"
ss. 
"Sloth and torpor don’t last very long these days, I"
 work so hard and sometimes can’t 
find time to sleep.  I should be the monk nodding m
ost in this monastery due the 
"amount of work I do, but I find I can go on retreat"
s and sit in front of hundreds of 
people meditating and I feel awake.  The reason I c
an do that is because I don’t feed 
"the defilements.  Mindfulness is right there, not o"
"n the sloth and torpor, not on the "
"knower, but in between them.  I want to see what I’"
m doing with the sloth and torpor.  
Am I reacting with controlling?  Am I just being on
e of the allies of M

"ra, the ‘great "
controller’?  I don’t do that; I put my mindfulness
 between the sloth and torpor and 
the 
"observer, "
making 
sure 
I’m 
being 
kind 
to 
the 
slo
th 
and 
torpor. 
Kindness 
overcomes the ill will.  Too often when you have sl
oth and torpor it is aversion that 
"feeds it.  It is the thought, ‘I don’t want it’, th"
at actually feeds sloth and torpor and 
"makes it last longer, because it is taking the ener"
gy away from knowing. 
"It is the same with restlessness and remorse, when "
the mind is thinking all over the 
place.  How are you relating to that?  What are you
 doing with it?  Put the energy of 
mindfulness between the knower and that restlessnes
s.  Don’t put your mindfulness on 
aversion or on desire – ‘I don’t want to be restles
s’ or ‘This restlessness is good.  I am 
"thinking of all these fantasies and plans, about "
Star
Wars
 or whatever’ – but notice 
instead how you are regarding that thought pattern 
in your mind.  If you see ill will or 
"desire, those first two hindrances, stomp on them, "
stop them.  If you see them as soon 
"as they arise, then it is very easy to stop these t"
hings. 
"If you are not looking in the right place, you can’"
t stop them.  So once you put your 
"mindfulness in the correct place, between the obser"
"ver and the observed, between the "
citta
" and the restlessness, it’s very easy to see why th"
ese things are going on.  We can 
very often say that restlessness comes from discont
ent and that discontent comes from 
"either ill will or desire, wanting something else, "
"wanting something more, not wanting "
272
"this.  So if we see where that discontent arises, t"
"hat is, between you and that restless "
"object, then you can stop it.  It’s fascinating to "
"see how soon restlessness disappears, "
sometimes within seconds; you can just cut the thou
ghts that easily.  But don’t use 
"force and effort, because that’s aversion.  You can"
’t cut restlessness and remorse by 
"being heedless, by waiting for them to stop, becaus"
e underneath you want these things 
"to carry on, you desire them, and you want them to "
happen.  Look at what’s between 
you 
and 
that 
"thing, "
and 
then 
you 
see 
what’s 
feeding
them. 
So 
you 
put 
your 
"mindfulness there, and then restlessness doesn’t la"
"st very long.  Nor does remorse, "
because remorse is always reacting to the past with
 desire and ill will. 
"It is the same with doubt, another form of restless"
ness.  Look between you and the 
object that you are aware of and put peace in there
", put acceptance in there, put "
patience in there. and you’ll find out later you do
n’t need to ask that question right 
now. 
Tranquillity of Body and Mind 
"So, these beautiful qualities called patience, free"
"dom, loving kindness, letting go, and "
"peace, are the opposites of the first two hindrance"
"s, but you cannot put them in if you "
don’t know where they go.  You have to insert these
" qualities like a pill, or an "
"injection, between the observer and the observed.  "
"Once you can see that space, you "
can put these things in there.  Mindfulness sees th
"at place, right skilful effort inserts "
"that peace, that letting go, into that space, and t"
he hindrances get suppressed.  As the 
"hindrances get suppressed, mindfulness grows in int"
ensity simply because you are not 
feeding 
the 
restlessness 
or 
the 
sloth 
and 
torpor. 
Mindfulness 
becomes 
brighter.  
You’re not doing anything so the energies of the mi
nd are not wasted.  Mindfulness 
"gets brighter and brighter, and you can see much mo"
re of what I am talking about.  
You’re more clearly aware of the space where mindfu
lness can be most effective.  
You find the object of your mind starts to become s
"till, peaceful, and beautiful.  Your "
meditation is going well; it’s moving in the right 
direction. 
Don’t try to control things or you’re putting your 
effort in the wrong spot.  You are 
trying to control the object when you should be con
"trolling what’s in between, in the "
sense of stopping the hindrances from arising.  The
 right effort is making sure you 
don’t do anything stupid.  We do stupid things all 
the time because we are not looking 
273
in the right place.  If we don’t do anything stupid
 we find this meditation becomes so 
"simple, "
so 
"powerful, "
and 
so 
deep. 
It 
doesn’t 
matte
r 
what 
you 
start 
off 
with.  
sometimes I don’t even watch the breath; I just wat
"ch the present moment, whatever’s "
happening now.  How am I watching it?  By making su
re I make peace with this 
moment and by putting stillness into it.  I make su
re those five hindrances don’t get 
"involved, especially the first two hindrances, beca"
use they’re the key ones.  They are 
the hindrances that underlie the other three.  By w
atching out for those first two 
"hindrances, by being mindful, whatever object I’m w"
atching just gets get brighter and 
"brighter.  Whatever I see, I see in more detail.  I"
"t becomes more peaceful, and because "
"I see it in more detail, it becomes more beautiful."
The object of the mind is not so important.  You ma
"y even watch an ugly skull, and "
"you may think, ‘why would a skull ever turn into an"
 object that I can use for 
jhanas
?’  
"But once your mindfulness grows and gets strong, th"
at skull can turn into a 
Citta
.  
It becomes the most beautiful skull you have ever s
een in the world.  You can do that 
with a piece of shit as well.  I’ve never done this
" meditation, but it could obviously "
"happen.  I don’t mean to offend anybody, but if you"
 just put a bit of shit before you 
"and watch the space between you and that object, ma"
"king it still and peaceful, while "
"visualizing it, after a while your mindfulness gets"
 so strong that even that shit will 
turn into a 
Citta
.  Because your mindfulness is so strong whatever y
ou look at 
becomes incredibly beautiful.  Some of you have had
 that experience; it’s a common 
meditation experience.  The most unlikely objects c
an turn into beautiful 
Citta
.  
Why does that happen?  It’s nothing to do with the 
object – it’s not Wat Pah Pong that 
is suffering or Wat Pah Pong that is the path to 
!!
", it’s just the suppressing of "
"the five hindrances, overcoming those defilements, "
the 
 #
", and making the mind "
very strong. 
Once you get into this practice the mindfulness get
s strong.  It sees where it should be 
focused.  It focuses there and gets stronger.  It s
ees the place where it should attend 
more and more and it becomes a self-supporting proc
ess.  As it becomes still it 
becomes more powerful.  As it becomes more powerful
 it becomes even more still.  
"You have got this whole process, which is the path "
to 
!!
 that is repeated again 
and again in the 
"suttas"
".  Once you get joy coming up, which is the strengt"
h of 
274
"mindfulness, you get "

", more joy, and then "

", the tranquillity of the body "
and the mind.  All these things happen simply becau
se you are looking in the right 
"place.  Things start to quieten down, you are not m"
"oving anything, you are not doing "
"things, and you are not disturbing anything. "
The hindrances disturb the whole process; they crea
te not just sloth and torpor but 
also restlessness and doubt.  Without the first two
 hindrances you see that mindfulness 
gets strong; you see where you are disturbing the w
hole process.  You get 

", "
and as mindfulness gets stronger and stronger you g
et 
"
"
", bliss, and that turns into "
samadhi
", into "
jhanas
. 
It’s an easy path; so if you haven’t got those 
jhanas
" yet, why not?  Are you putting "
your 
mindfulness 
in 
the 
correct 
place? 
Is 
the 
mind
fulness 
getting 
stronger 
and 
"stronger, more and more powerful?  What is the prob"
lem with your meditation?  
"Sometimes you say, “I’ve been watching the breath f"
"or years, why isn’t it working?”  "
It isn’t working because of how you are watching th
e breath.  You’re watching the 
"breath with controlling, with aversion, with wantin"
g something.  It’s not the breath’s 
"fault or Wat Pah Pong’s fault, it’s the way you are"
 regarding Wat Pah Pong and it’s 
the way you are regarding the breath.  So look at h
ow you are watching the breath.  
Certainly that was very clear to me.  When I was wa
"tching the breath, when I was "
"trying to get somewhere, it would never settle down"
.  It’s obvious to me now that I 
was feeding the hindrances; I should have been watc
hing out for the hindrances rather 
than the breath.  Now I know how to watch the breat
"h with peace and tranquillity, "
"without expecting anything, showing loving kindness"
" to this breath, however it is.  It’s "
good enough for me; this is good enough!  Remember 
all those great teachings like 
Ajahn 
"1
"
"’s, ‘just being in the beautiful breath’.  It’s "
how
 you’re breathing in the 
breath and 
how
 you are breathing out the breath:  that is Ajahn 
"1
"
’s great 
teaching and that’s the important part.  You put yo
ur mindfulness right there; it’s not 
"what you’re breathing in, but how you’re breathing "
in now. 
If you are watching your body and doing body medita
"tion, it is how you are watching "
your body that matters.  You may be going through t
"he thirty-two parts of the body, "
but how you are relating to those thirty two parts?
  What are you doing it for?  Why 
275
are you doing it?  What’s between you and that exer
cise?  Unless you investigate you 
will never get to the goal of this path.  Remember:
"  hindrances, hindrances, hindrances "
– 
they 
are 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
Buddha’s 
teachings. 
We 
have 
to 
suppress 
those 
"hindrances, and to eventually eradicate them fully."
  The hindrances weaken not just 
"wisdom, they also weaken mindfulness.  You can unde"
rstand how they do that:  any 
"desire, craving, controlling or ill will takes the "
energy away from the mind and 
reduces the natural brilliance of the 
citta
.  The radiance of the 
citta
 is what you might 
call the sign of strong mindfulness.  When you expe
rience that strong mindfulness 
you understand the sort of mindfulness which is nec
essary for Enlightenment.  This is 
"why the Buddha said to empower that mindfulness, ma"
inly through 
samadhi
", and then "
you will see things as they truly are.

"When you see things as they truly are, you can see "
"the playground, the place where "
"these hindrances arise, where the defilements grow,"
 and you understand what delusion 
is.  Once you see the fuel source it’s just so easy
 to stop it.  Once mindfulness is 
"strong and directed to the right place, you see how"
'
 works.  ‘
'
 I know you!’  
You can see 
'
 in that space between you and what you are experie

where 
'
" lives.  If you notice that, you can let go.  By kn"
owing it’s 
'
", then "
'
 just disappears.  Once you can see that space betw
een you and what you are 
"experiencing, "
make 
that 
space 
"beautiful, "
"pure, "
peac
"eful, "
"compassionate, "
"free, "
"liberating; don’t allow any greed, hatred, or delus"
ion there.  And then the path is open 
for you.  It is the path to 
!!
. 
"Keep that up; maintain mindfulness in that place, a"
nd maintain the effort to keep that 
space pure of the hindrances.  If you keep it pure 
from the first two hindrances the 
"other three will also be kept in check, and you fin"
d that whatever you watch becomes 
so peaceful and that the mindfulness grows more ale
"rt, more powerful, and more "
happy.  It doesn’t matter what you are watching.  S
"ometimes I’m sick, and even "
recently I’ve had a bad cold.  Still I’ve been able
" to perform at my top level, for the "
"last couple of weeks, doing all this work and trave"
lling.  The reason I can do that is 
that I put the attention in that place between me a
nd what I am experiencing.  I make 
that pure and then this cold can’t bother me.  By d
oing that you can keep on going:  
276
"you can meditate, you can teach, because the cold i"
s not a problem anymore.  It only 
matters how I react to that irritation of the body.
"  If I keep putting peace there, putting "
"freedom there, if I keep putting compassion there, "
"if I keep putting non-controlling, "
non-aversion there – If I keep that place empty and
 pure – it means that the energies 
of my mind are really strong.  When the energies of
 the mind are really strong there is 
"brightness, "
there’s 
"happiness, "
and 
that 
happiness 
a
nd 
brightness 
is 
the 
power 
of 
mindfulness.  That mindfulness being so powerful ca
"n even take that cold that cough, "
and make it into a beautiful object.  This is how w
e use mindfulness.  And when that 
mindfulness is so strong that the five hindrances h
ave gone we gain the 
jhanas
", and "
now mindfulness is incredibly powerful.  That’s whe
n we start to understand that this 
"body, these feelings, this "
citta
", these objects of the mind, are not me, not mine, "
not a 
self. 
First of all we empower our mind and make mindfulne
ss stronger by obliterating the 
five hindrances.  The mindfulness is not just stron
"g; it’s a powerful, brilliant, still "
"mindfulness.  The five hindrances have gone, and yo"
u can take up any object and see 
"so deeply into it.  It’s blissful, and it’s powerfu"
l.  Sometimes you wonder why it has to 
be so blissful and then you understand that bliss c
omes from the energy of the mind.  
"Without that bliss, without that power of mindfulne"
"ss, not only would it not be able to "
"penetrate, but it would not be able to overcome the"
 inherent fear of seeing something 
that is going to destroy your basic delusions. 
The power of mindfulness is so important because of
" the fear of losing your ‘self’, of "
losing your ego.  Your sense of identity is so stro
ng that it is probably one of the last 
barriers to overcoming 

", one of the last barriers that you have to overcom"
e to 
become an 

.  The fear of complete disappearance is a barrier 
that very few 
people get over.  One of the ways you can get over 
that barrier is with the power of 
"mindfulness and its bliss, because bliss is an incr"
edibly great energy.  It empowers 
you:  you are just so blissed out that nothing can 
make you afraid; you just go right 
over those barriers of fear.  Who cares if I disapp
ear; who cares if there’s nothing left 
afterwards.  The bliss is so strong you just go rig
ht through.  This is mindfulness 
"being so empowered, so courageous, so strong, that "
"you go against all your illusions, "
"preconceptions, and habitual views.  Mindfulness is"
 just so powerful that all those 
277
things you want to believe cannot exist and all the
 things that you are too afraid to 
accept open up nevertheless.  You just go right ove
r them or right through them.  
That’s how Enlightenment happens.  That’s what insi
ght truly is. 
"All the really good insights, the ones that are wor"
"th something, are just like the "
biggest kick up the butt you have ever had; but it’
"s a beautiful, blissful kick up the "
butt.  What’s happened?  My god something’s differe
nt!  You are shocked and moved 
you into a new way of looking and thinking.  This i
"s the power that is necessary.  So, "
"with right mindfulness, the first job is actually t"
o empower it and make sure you are 
placing what little mindfulness you have in the rig
ht spot.  You can’t afford to waste 
your 
mindfulness. 
Do not 
be 
concerned about 
what 
y
ou are experiencing: 
the 
"problem is not this monastery, the food, the body, "
or these words.  Don’t put your 
mindfulness 
there. 
Put 
your 
mindfulness 
on 
how 
you
are 
reacting 
to 
your 
experiences.  What are you doing with them in this 
very moment?  Are you at peace 
with them?  Even if you don’t like what’s happening
", even if it’s wrong, that’s not the "
point; the point is just to be at peace with it.  W
hen someone calls you a pig or a 
"donkey, when someone says you are the most stupid, "
"lazy, arrogant, proud monk in "
"this whole monastery, it doesn’t matter.  What matt"
ers is what is between you and 
those 
words. 
Put 
peace 
"there, "
put 
compassion 
and 
e
mptiness 
there; 
then 
the 
hindrances will not arise.  The world will no longe
r move you.  There will always be 
"peace no matter what happens, even if you are being"
 tortured.  Whatever you are 
experiencing put peace and tranquillity between you
 and that feeling.  Make peace 
with it.  It’s just nature to have extreme 
#
.  If you put peace and tranquillity 
"there, the hindrances can’t survive and even tortur"
e becomes beautiful.  In other words 
it just disappears; it’s not torture anymore. 
When mindfulness is in the right place the mind bec
"omes incredibly strong, brave, "
and courageous.  The 
jhanas
 just happen:  you can’t stop them because you’ve s
een 
the hindrances that stop 
samadhi
" happening.  As mindfulness grows, the hindrances "
can’t survive.  You have this incredible anti-virus
 that is focusing on just the correct 
"spot and when you hit that spot, the place between "
"you and the experience, it’s "
amazing what happens.  The hindrances can’t survive
 for very long.  The 
 #
 run 
"out of food, mindfulness gets strong. and bliss sta"
rts to come up.  Stillness happens 
278
and restlessness cannot survive.  There is powerful
" mindfulness, bliss, and absolute "
stillness.  When that builds up it is called 
jhana
. 
A good description of 
jhana
" is incredible bliss, stillness, and intense mindfu"
lness.  
You 
are 
building 
up 
these 
things 
so 
that 
you 
are 
ma
king 
them 
into 
a 
jhana
.  
Afterwards when you come out of that 
jhana
" and a little bit of the stillness has gone, "
"you see that the mind can move, but not very much. "
 The mindfulness is now so 
"strong, so penetrating, and so courageous that you "
see where those hindrances come 
from.  You understand that they come from this delu
"sion of ‘me’ and the ‘doer’, "
thinking that you’re in control of all of this.  Yo
u can focus on the Anattalakkhana 
Sutta:  the five 

" are not me, not mine, not a self.  If they were I "
could make 
"them like this, make them like that.  I could tell "
"my body, ‘please, don’t have a "
"cough’, ‘please, don’t get sick’, ‘please, don’t sl"
"eep so much’, ‘please, be fit and don’t "
get old’.  You can’t do that.  You can’t do that to
 your 
#
" either:  ‘please, only "
"have pleasant feelings, no coughs, no bad sounds fr"
"om other people, and no criticism’.  "
You can’t do that.  ‘May I have a monastery that is
" nice and warm, not too cold, one "
where I don’t have to work too much.’  You can’t do
 that!  Let go for goodness sake!  
When you see that there is no one in here controlli
"ng any of it, that there is only "
"emptiness – no me, no mine, not a self, no ‘doer’, "
"no ‘knower’, just a process with no "
essential me – that’s freedom.  It’s wonderful:  at
" last there is no one in here, no one to "
"get reborn to suffer, to give talks, to travel to S"
"ingapore, or to give ordinations.  There "
is no one to listen to these people ringing up ever
"y evening with their problems, no "
one who has to get up in the morning and go through
 it all again.  It’s beautiful to 
know that there is no one left in there.  So you ca
n say that this is your last life.  End it 
"all, that’s wonderful; just bring along with you as"
 many people as you can. 
Conclusion 
The trick to make right mindfulness grow is to put 
it in the right spot.  See more 
clearly and get empowered.  When you are empowered 
through the 
jhanas
", you can "
put your mindfulness onto the five 

", the six sense bases, the body and the "
"mind, and you see through it so easily.  Once you s"
"ee through it, it’s not just that the "
"five hindrances are suppressed, they are smashed to"
" smithereens, and they can’t arise "
again.  That way your mindfulness is always just ri
ght there in the space between the 
279
seeing and the seen.  There is no attachment left n
ow; in its place it is just this 
"process, this dance of "

", cause and effect, cause and effect.  When you see"
 the 
process of 
kamma
 you can undo it all:  through the ending of delusi
on comes the 
ending of the 
kamma
 formations.  You stop making hindrances between yo
u and the 
objects.  There is no 
kamma
" being made, you don’t do anything – no desire, no "
"aversion, no doing – you are just making natural pe"
ace in every moment between the 
observer and the observed.  No 
kamma
 formation is what is meant by 
$

", the cessation of "
$
.  That means there is nothing to give rise to a ne
w 
"life, a new consciousness; the "
**
" in the next life won’t arise, and neither will the"


.  The objects of consciousness in the next life ar
"e ended, done with.  A "
good job done! 
So this is mindfulness put in the space between you
 and what you are observing.  You 
will never get upset at anything that happens to yo
u in this monastery again.  You will 
never have craving for anything in this monastery. 
 You get food and you just eat it 
with no desire or aversion.  When you give up desir
"e and ill will, sloth and torpor "
"won’t have any fuel, restlessness and doubt will be"
" gone, and you will get into deep "
"meditation, "
jhanas
", Enlightenment, the whole works. "

19  PERFECT STILLNESS 
29
th
 June 2005 
Today’s talk is on the final factor of the Eightfol
"d Path, which would be accurate to "
"call the culmination of the Path, "

samadhi
.  There is only one definition given 
by the Buddha of 

samadhi
 and that is 
jhana
.  The Perfect Teacher consistently 
and repeatedly explained the final factor of the Pa
th as one or more of the four 
jhanas
.  
"Never, not even once, did the Buddha utter the word"
s 

samadhi
(momentary 
"concentration), "
"
"
samadhi
 (neighbourhood concentration) or 
vipassana
jhanas
.  
These apocryphal terms were coined much later than 
the time of the Buddha.  A 
"disciple of the Buddha, one who faithfully follows "
"his teachings, must of necessity "
repeat the Buddha’s explanation that 

samadhi
 means the four 
jhanas
", only the "
four 
jhanas
", and nothing but the four "
jhanas
. 
I maintain that the 
jhanas
 were rediscovered by 

1
 for this age.  They 
are 
crucial 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
Path. 
The 
on
ly 
people 
who 
say 
that 
Enlightenment is possible without the 
jhanas
 are those who have never experienced a 
jhana
.  If you have the experience of 
jhanas
" you know their power, importance, and "
"value, which is why the eighth factor of the Eightf"
old Path is 

samadhi
.  It’s an 
important factor of the path. 
"However, because Buddhism has only recently come to"
" Western countries, people are "
still struggling to understand the importance of th
e term 
jhanas
.  In past times they 
"thought, "
"‘Yeah, "

These days I really shy away from calling 
samadhi
 ‘right concentration’.  I’ve been 
calling it ‘right letting go’ for a long time now a
nd this evening I’m going to give it 
"another name, ‘perfect stillness’ or ‘right stillne"
ss’.  The reason I say that is because it 
is the stillness of the mind that not only gives ri
se to 

samadhi
", the "
jhanas
", but "
it’s also a beautiful description showing the way t
o get into these stages.  It’s very 
important people experience these stages and discov
er how easy they are.  If we give 
"these stages the right name, a name that describes "
them at least with some of their 
"important features, even if not perfectly, that wil"
l make it easier. 
"It becomes quite clear why some people, even some m"
"onks, do not attain those stages "
in 
their 
"lifetimes, "
if 
they 
are 
trying 
to 
attain 
co
ncentration. 
The 
very 
word 
concentration in the Western world means some ‘doin
"g’, some force, or work.  We are "
told at school to concentrate as if it is something
 that you do through an exercise of 
will.  When we understand what 
samadhi
" is, what "
jhana
" is, then we understand what a "
stupid idea that is.  It goes in completely the opp
osite direction of what’s needed to 
gain 
samadhi
. 
The experience of 
samadhi
 shows you the way out of 

.  It shows you what 
Enlightenment is.  It shows you the doorway to the 
‘deathless’.  So it’s very apt to call 
the 
jhanas
" the doorway to the deathless.  Yes, we practise al"
l the factors of the 
"Eightfold Path, but it is essential that they culmi"
nate in the 
jhanas
.  The 
jhanas
 are the 
"doorway, and through them you get the insights and "
wisdom that carry you all the 
way to cessation.  But first of all you have to att
"ain those stages of stillness, the "
jhanas
themselves. 
When we investigate these states of stillness it be
comes quite clear that every time we 
do something we are disturbing the mind.  We’re dis
turbing the process and making it 
tremble; we’re making the mind wobble.  We are doin
g exactly the thing that stops 
the attainment.  That is why when we talk about the
se stages – the culmination of 
which is the stillness of the mind – it becomes qui
te evident and clear that the 
obstructions to the path and the obstacles to the 
jhanas
 arise because we are always 
getting 
"involved, "
"interfering, "
"controlling, "
and 
man
"aging, "
even 
by 
just 
having 
destinations or goals. 
282
Have You Come Here to Die? 
At 
one 
retreat 
that 
I 
gave 
recently 
I 
"said, "
“Try 
an
d 
meditate 
without 
having 
a 
destination”.  The people asked me what I meant by 
"that.  They said, “We can’t do "
that; we’ll fall asleep and the mind will just go a
"ll over the place.”  I said, “Give it a "
"go and see what happens, but be consistent througho"
ut the whole meditation.  For the 
whole nine days have no destination”. 
If people have no destination they feel lost.  Why 
do they feel lost?  Because at last 
they have nothing to do and they can’t get into the
 ‘doing’ business.  They can’t get a 
"handle on something to aim for or to do, so it conf"
"ounds the ‘doer’, it confounds the "
"‘controller’, and underneath all of that is the con"
founding of the sense of ‘self’.  This 
is why the meditation seems so hard. 
"In the first year of my life at Wat Pah Pong, Ajahn"
" Chah used to ask, “Have you come "
to Wat Pah Pong to die?”  Obviously he didn’t mean 
physical death; he meant the 
death 
of 
the 
‘self’. 
It 
was 
one 
of 
those constant 
refrains 
that 
you 
hear 
in 
any 
monastery.  You’ll also notice that with me: I’ve g
"ot phases and fashions I go through, "
little teachings which are repeated over and over a
"gain for about three or four months, "
and then they change and I get into another fashion
.  I will go back to that teaching 
after a few years and repeat these old things – the
y are all still valid – but I put them 
into a different perspective. 
“Have you come here to die?”  That’s what it feels 
like when you start meditating 
properly.  There is something inside you that dies 
or comes close to death.  That’s the 
"aspect of the ‘self’ called the ‘doer’, the ‘maker’"
", the active participant in life that "
"always wants to manage, to work things out, so that"
 you can describe it to yourself or 
"tell your friends.  Even the will to know, to under"
"stand, is part of this ‘doer’ business.  "
That’s why it gives rise to doubt. 
Each one of the hindrances keeps the mind active an
d stops it from being still enough 
to see that the five hindrances are all about doing
 something.  Obviously the first 
"hindrance of sensory desire, craving, wanting somet"
"hing, is all about going to some "
"sort of destination, someplace you want to get to. "
" Aversion, the second hindrance is "
283
"about not wanting to be here in the first place, an"
d that creates ‘doing’.  It’s being 
"averse to this moment, to the wandering mind – bein"
g averse to anything.  ‘I don’t 
"want to be here, I want to be somewhere else.’  The"
" third hindrance, sloth and torpor, "
is the result of doing too much.  You’ve burnt out 
"the mind.  You’re just too tired, and "
the mind has no energy because it’s all been wasted
 in doing things.  When people 
"start ‘doing’, when they start struggling and striv"
"ing to get out of sloth and torpor, it’s "
just more doing and it stirs up the mind.  I’m sure
 you think you’ve got to stir the 
mind up to become alert again.  But you don’t reall
"y stir up the mindfulness, instead "
"you stir up more craving.  Sure, that brightens up "
the mind and you don’t have sloth 
"and torpor, but you have restlessness instead. "
In a previous talk I said it was a great insight fo
r me to see that I was always 
oscillating between sloth and torpor and restlessne
ss.  I’d be slothful in the morning 
because Thailand is such a hot country for a Wester
n monk.  The food was terrible 
and there was no nutrition in it.  No wonder we had
 low energy levels; it was a 
physical problem.  At three o’clock in the early mo
rning when we had to get up we 
hadn’t had enough sleep and we didn’t get enough nu
"trition.  We were hot and sticky, "
"not used to that environment at all.  Physically, o"
"f course we were tired.  So, what did "
I do?  I struggled to get through that tiredness:  
"‘Come on Brahm, get your act "
together!  Be more mindful’.  And because I was con
trolling and managing and 
"forcing, yes, I would break through the sloth and t"
"orpor, but then I would be restless "
thinking about all sorts of things.  I was oscillat
ing between the two.  When I got 
"restless I’d calm down, stop the thoughts, and then"
 I’d just go into dullness again.  
Some of you may recognize that oscillation between 
dullness and restlessness. 
This oscillating between those two hindrances all c
"omes from ‘doing’, from trying to "
control.  That’s the reason I’ve had incredible suc
cess on meditation retreats when I 
"tell people, “If you feel sleepy go and rest”.  The"
"y say, “Oh, but I should fight my "
sloth and torpor.  I can’t go and rest.  That’s bei
"ng lazy”.  I say, “Listen, go and rest”, "
and because Malaysians and Singaporeans are quite f
aithful and have a lot of trust in 
"me they do that, and they always get good meditatio"
ns afterwards.  They usually only 
rest in the first few days and afterwards they have
 all this energy. 
284
At the last retreat I taught in Ipoh we had some in
"credible results.  One lady, who was "
"already sitting for four, five, or six hours at a t"
"ime, sat for eight and a half hours on "
"the last day.  It was just so easy, she had so much"
 stillness that she didn’t want to 
move.  That was because she had stopped ‘doing thin
gs’.  She had stopped making the 
"mind move.  Stillness was her goal, not, seeing "
Citta
" or holding on to the breath, "
not attaining 
jhanas
or Enlightenment.  She had a meditation that had no
 destination.  
"The aim is not getting somewhere, it’s being here. "
Being here and being still
. 
"The last of the hindrances is doubt, always ‘wantin"
g to know’.  That is just another 
‘doing’.  Knowledge is almost like control:  measur
ing is how we find out where we 
"are in life.  And that ‘doing’, measuring, and ‘wan"
"ting to know’, makes the mind "
move.  Be quiet!  You’ll 
know
 later on.  Don’t interrupt the lecture; just wait 
and don’t 
do anything.  This is the path of 
samadhi
.

 I Know You 
When 
you 
don’t 
do anything 
you’re 
not feeding 
the 
h
indrances. 
This 
is 
where 
mindfulness should be used in your meditation.  It 
doesn’t matter what you are 
experiencing – you may even be thinking of sex – th
e point is to make sure you don’t 
do anything.  Don’t get upset.  Don’t encourage it.
  Don’t get into aversion.  In fact 
don’t get into anything at all.  If you put peace i
nto this letting go by putting stillness 
"between you and whatever you are experiencing, thin"
gs start to slow down and stop.  
"It’s the hindrances that are the problem, not what "
they have created.  It’s the creating 
power of these hindrances that causes more sufferin
g and a lack of stillness for you. 
"So, if you put your mind in the right spot and watc"
h the play of the hindrances – the 
"doing, craving, wanting, the trying to get rid of t"
"hings, the talking to yourself the "
"trying to understand things, and then getting sleep"
y and upset about it – you can see 
where the five hindrances live.  You find their pla
"yground, their home.  Once you see "
"where they are playing around, you can knock them t"
o bits very easily.  You can kick 
their arse!  When you do that to those five hindran
ces they hurt and they stop.  You 
"kick them by telling them, ‘Shush, I’m not going to"
 do anything.  I’m just going to 
watch’.  Do you remember how the Buddha and the gre
at monks defeated 
'
?  
They didn’t get 
'
" and kick him.  They just said, “"
'
 I know you”!  They saw 
285
where 
'
 was playing.  They saw the area that is just betwe
en you and the object 
"you’re watching now, the area where the hindrances "
"and the defilements live, and they "
"said, “No”.  They were just still, without ‘doing’ "
anything.  
Look at the metaphor of having a destination.  Cons
ider how long in your life you 
have been trying to get somewhere.  We’ve all had t
"hese destinations, these goals.  "
It’s only a few weeks now until the Rains Retreat b
egins.  How many of you are 
trying to get things out of the way so that you are
" ready for the Retreat, trying to get "
your projects finished and all of your letters writ
ten?  How many of you have goals 
"and are thinking, ‘When I’ve got all of this done, "
then I can stop’.  But what happens 
as soon as the Rains Retreat starts?  You have anot
her goal:  ‘Now I am going to get 
some 
jhanas
"’, ‘I’ve got to do this exercise’, ‘I’ve got to wri"
"te this book’, ‘I’m going to "
read that book.’  Always setting goals – when you’v
e got goals you’ve got something 
to ‘do’.  Isn’t it amazing? 
"If you put yourself into a hut and say, “I’ve got n"
"othing to do, absolutely nothing.  All "
"those letters I am supposed to write, who cares?  I"
’ll put them in the bin and burn 
"them all.  I’m doing absolutely nothing, having no "
"goals, no destinations.  I’m not just "
"saying this, I’m doing it.  I’m not reading any boo"
ks and I’m not going to write any 
letters so that I can ‘
do’
samadhi
”.  You’re missing the point again! 
"This sense of self, this delusion, is so sneaky tha"
t most of the time we let go of one 
"thing, only to do something else.  We are always st"
"riving to go somewhere, always "
"active, "
always 
doing 
something 
and 
because 
of 
that 
we are 
missing 
the 
path to 
samadhi
. 
Sometimes you sit in your hut and that’s good enoug
h.  Whatever happens next who 
"cares?  You think, ‘I’m just going to be aware of w"
hat’s happening now and do 
absolutely nothing about it.’  Even if your hut is 
"a mess, sit there and do nothing about "
it.  Even if your mind is a mess do nothing about i
t.  Just do nothing.  If you 
understand what I mean by this you’re ‘making’ incr
edible peace.  You’re ‘making’ 
"stillness, and after a while when you attain the "
jhanas
 you understand what the whole 
286
process is about.  You also understand why people d
on’t get 
jhanas
", why they don’t "
"even get into deep states of meditation, and why th"
ey don’t even watch the breath. 
You should know from the 

a
 
"Sutta"
 that if the five 

" were ‘me’, "
"if they belonged to me, if they were a self, I woul"
d be able to tell these five 

", "
"‘Oh, may my body be so; oh, may my "
#
 just be the 
"
"
 of deep meditation; 
"oh, may my perception be of the light of "
Citta
"; oh, may my "
$
" be still; oh, "
may 
my 
consciousness 
of 
the 
five 
senses 
disappear 
a
nd 
may 
I 
only 
have 
the 
"consciousness of the mind; oh, may I get the "
jhanas
 and become Enlightened’.  The 
"Buddha said you can’t do that, it’s impossible.  So"
 can’t we understand what the 
Buddha is saying and stop it? 
"That’s actually what the Buddha said, “Stop it; sto"
"p it!”  Monks, stop it.  Lay people "
"and visitors stop it.  Stop doing things, stop goin"
"g places, and trying to achieve things.  "
If one really stops all this running around one see
s the meaning of 

.  

"is the perpetual wandering, the perpetual moving, t"
he perpetual journey.  Always 
walking on and thinking that when you get to the ne
"xt step or the next goal, you will "
be able to rest there and do nothing for evermore. 
 But that journey is endless.  You 
are 
always 
going 
"somewhere, "
"walking, "
"travelling, "
an
d 
trying 
to 
get 
somewhere.  
"That’s not been just in this life, it’s been going "
"on for countless lifetimes, and you’ve "
never ever stopped.  There is an old English phrase
", ‘In the journey of life, please "
remember to stop and smell the roses’.  What I mean
 by that is in your lifetime please 
stop and smell the 
jhanas
.  That is what happens when you stop.  You smell t
he four-
petalled 
jhanas
":  the first, second, third and fourth "
jhana
 because you have stopped 
trying. 
Many meditators have told me that because they have
 taken this advice to stop – 
which goes against the grain – and have actually gi
"ven up, let go, and abandoned "
"everything, they get into the deep states of medita"
tion.  It works.  It’s true!  This is 
how I meditate.  I sit down and I don’t do anything
.  All my mindfulness is directed to 
making sure I don’t forget and start doing things. 
 That’s the nature of the delusory 
self.  The thing we are trying to uncover and see i
s a fallacy.  Whenever you think you 
"exist, or assume you exist and perceive that ‘self’"
", that is the cause of doing things.  "
287
When the ‘me’ illusion is active we always interfer
e with things:  that’s what the ‘self’ 
"does, that’s a ‘me’ – its function is to interfere."
"  That is why this sense of ‘non-doing’, "
"of stillness, goes against the grain.  It goes agai"
"nst the grain of what the ‘self’, what "
"the illusion, really wants. "
Give Up Hope 
The ‘self’ is that which controls the whole purpose
 of being.  To be is to do.  You 
have got to do something otherwise you feel that yo
u are dying.  In the last retreat 
some people who experienced 
samadhi
 said they thought they were dying and they 
"were afraid.  So I said, “Well done, die some more”"
.  It’s fun dying.  You die to the 
body and the body disappears.  Die to the five sens
es and you can’t hear or see 
anything.  It’s as if you were a dead corpse.  You 
"die to the will, to everything.  "
Imagine what we are saying here.  When there is no 
will the body is not moving.  It’s 
not reacting any more.  You poke it and it doesn’t 
respond.  If you were in a 
jhana
 and 
someone opened your eye lids and shone a light into
 your eye it wouldn’t respond.  
You’re dying to the world.  That’s what Ajahn Chah 
"meant when he asked, “Have you "
come here to die?”  When the ‘doer’ dies so does a 
"large part of consciousness, "
temporarily.  That’s what stillness means.  That wh
ich moves the world has now 
temporarily gone.  Lots of things have disappeared 
and you’ve died.  If anyone 
"remembers their past lives, that is what it is like"
 to die.  It is so similar to the dying 
process.  After the pain and the trouble of the dyi
"ng process the five senses disappear, "
just as the five senses disappear in deep meditatio
n. 
With the death experience you still have a little b
it of will left; that’s the problem.  If 
you can let that go you get into the 
jhana
 realms.  That ‘doing’ is what keeps you 
active 
and stops 
you 
from 
being 
reborn 
into 
the 
jhana
realms 
or even 
going 
to 
!!
.  There are a lot of similarities.  So once one un
"derstands what stillness is, "
"what the defilements are, and what the hindrances a"
"re, it should become obvious how "
to get into 
jhanas
. 
Don’t try and sit through pain.  That’s doing somet
hing again.  That’s just some sort 
"of attainment, some sort of Brownie badge, or Scout"
 badge that you can put on.  
"“There, I’ve sat through pain!”  We are not here to"
 get attainments.  We are here to let 
288
go of everything.  Letting go is what some people c
"all attainments, but in truth, in "
"reality, it’s a non-attainment.  You haven’t done a"
nything.  You have stopped doing 
anything.  You wonder why people praise you for the
se things.  You haven’t done 
anything.  It’s true!  If you get into a 
jhana
 you haven’t done anything.  That’s what 
makes it so beautiful and wonderful.  You are going
 in completely the opposite 
direction to what is supposed to be praised in the 
"world, that is, getting attainments or "
getting medals. 
You don’t deserve any medals.  You don’t deserve an
y praise because you’ve attained 
"these states due to ‘selflessness’.  So, if you wan"
t to attain those 
jhanas
", do nothing.  If "
you want to do ‘nothing’ give up your sense of ‘sel
f’.  Give up your pride.  Give up 
your ego.  Die to your ‘self’ and completely abando
n everything.  Be someone who 
has no destination. 
Christianity gets it wrong when it says that on the
 doors of Hell there is a big sign 
saying ‘GIVE UP HOPE ALL WHO ENTER HERE’.  In medit
ation ‘GIVE UP 
"HOPE’, and you will have everything you ever wanted"
":  joy, bliss, happiness, and so "
much stillness.  It’s in the stillness that you exp
erience the power of 
samadhi
.  You 
may not have got into 
jhanas
" yet, but those who have experienced deep meditatio"
n 
"states, notice the stillness in them.  The more sti"
ll you are the less the mind moves and 
the more happiness you have.  The more peace you ha
"ve, the more power the mind "
has.  You can feel this is going in the correct dir
ection. 
Perhaps that was one of the reasons I was able to d
evelop deep 
samadhi
", because even "
the first time that I meditated I felt that somethi
ng there was right.  The peace was 
becoming still and things stopped moving; I felt th
at I was on the correct path.  
Fortunately I had good teachers who even in those e
arly days encouraged me in that 
"way to stillness.  So, don’t do anything.  Just see"
 how much you can not do.  Catch 
any movement of the mind that might try to do somet
hing or get somewhere. 
"You are sitting down, and you are on a journey of l"
ife.  You are not moving and you 
are not looking forward to any destination.  You ar
e not holding anything from the 
past.  You are practising a ‘no destination’ medita
tion.  ‘This is absolutely good 
289
"enough, and so I don’t want to move.’  You build st"
illness upon stillness upon 
"stillness, always seeing the cause of any vibration"
 or trembling in the mind.  Anything 
that stops the mind settling into this deep meditat
ion is all coming from the illusion of 
‘self’.  You want to get 
jhanas
 because you think that is going to make you a bett
er 
monk.  That’s an ego trip again.  ‘You’ want to get
 Enlightenment.  Its ego again.  
‘I’m 
Enlightened!’ 
‘I’m 
an 

!’ 
‘I’ve 
got 
the 
jhana
what 
have 
you 
got?’  
‘You’ve only got second 
jhana
", I got that years ago.  I’ve attained third "
jhana
!’  All 
that sort of stuff that sometimes comes up is ego. 
 That is the reason we don’t start 
"shouting out our attainments in public, because it "
doesn’t make sense.  They have 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
an 
ego 
or 
a 
‘self’. 
Ego 
is 
the 
complete 
opposite 
of 
these 
attainments.  Who’s attaining these things?  No one
 is.  It’s just a disappearing from 

", a stillness, a vanishing.  The whole Eightfold Pa"
th is a vanishing act.  You 
are disappearing more and more and more. 
How can you disappear by being still?  Haven’t you 
ever noticed that when things are 
still 
they 
disappear? 
When 
your 
body 
is 
still 
it 
s
oon 
vanishes 
from 
your 
consciousness.  Consciousness is called 
**
 in 
Pali
 because it discriminates.  The 
prefix 
Vi
" implies it’s two, the same as the Latin word "
bi
.  It means ‘two things’:  
an 
object 
has 
to 
move 
both 
backwards 
and 
forwards 
for 
consciousness 
to 
know 
it
.  
"Consciousness needs something to compare with, and "
anything that is perfectly still 
eventually stops consciousness.  That’s why conscio
usness can only know movement 
and change.  

 is 

", impermanent, but when "

" stops, "
!!
 or 
cessation is 

", which is permanent.  When things stop nothing mov"
es; there is 
"stability.  So, the path into this meditation is to"
 sit there and not do anything. 
Many monks know that when they start to develop 
jhanas
 they tend to force the mind.  
First of all they try and sit for long periods of t
ime.  They strive and strive to watch 
their breath.  But all monks know that at the very 
end they have to start letting go and 
stop ‘doing’.  In fact it’s even better to stop ear
"lier, from the very beginning, instead "
of wasting time.  That’s what experience has taught
 me.  Years ago I’d meditate and 
"really watch the breath, really force my mind onto "
the breath and then when I had the 
breath I would let go.  I eventually realized that 
I was wasting too much time.  Now I 
"let go straight away when I first sit down, not doi"
"ng anything, just making peace with "
290
the moment.  It doesn’t matter what I am experienci
"ng, what thought is in my mind, "
what sound is around me.  As Ajahn Chah famously sa
"id, ‘It’s not the sound that "
"disturbs you, you disturb the sound’.  It’s not the"
" thoughts that disturb you, you "
disturb the thoughts.  It’s not the pain that distu
"rbs you, you disturb the pain.  It’s not "
the 
five 
senses 
that 
disturb 
"you, "
you 
disturb 
the 
f
ive 
senses. 
It’s 
not 
even 
the 
hindrances that disturb you – they’re old 
kamma
", once you see them – it’s you who "
disturb the hindrances.  You make the hindrances gr
ow and give them power.  If you 
"say, “Five hindrances, I know you”, you don’t distu"
"rb them.  Just say, “I know you.  I "
see you.  I’m not going to do anything.  I’m not go
ing to move because of you”.  Then 
the mind doesn’t move and the mind starts to slow d
own and stop.  It’s a wonderful 
process just to sit there and watch. 
You have all these thoughts because you have respon
sibilities and perhaps you have 
"been talking too much, so just sit down and stop.  "
First of all the past and the future 
disappears because you have stopped in time.  That 
"means there are no minutes, "
"hours, days, or years.  Is it morning or afternoon?"
  Who cares!  Stop the clock with 
‘present moment awareness’.  All those thoughts in 
"the mind, just leave them alone, "
and in a few minutes they stop.  Understand where t
he thoughts come from:  you are 
"prodding the mind, poking it, making it move.  And "
those thoughts are what a moving 
mind sounds like.  It’s as if you’re wearing one of
 those plastic anoraks.  When you 
move it sort of rustles.  That’s what you do with t
he mind:  there is a sort of rustling in 
the mind.  It’s because you are moving it.  If you 
shake a tree you hear all the leaves 
and twigs moving.  All these thoughts are the resul
t of shaking the mind.  If you leave 
the tree alone it will be absolutely still.  It doe
sn’t make any noise at all.  That’s what 
happens with the mind.  You just stop:  don’t do an
ything and the thoughts slow down 
completely.  They finish and vanish.  If you try to
 stop the thinking by ‘doing’ it just 
goes on and on forever. 
The Stages of Stopping 
"So, those of you who have been trying to stop the m"
"ind thinking, please understand "
your fault.  Stop trying to do anything.  Stop ‘doi
"ng’; just watch, make peace, let go, "
and practise contentment.  That’s good enough.  Don
"’t even think, ‘I must stop’, "
because that’s more ‘doing’.  Just understand what 
stopping means and stop.  When 
"you stop, the thoughts go.  Sometimes I don’t even "
need the breath anymore.  The 
291
vehicle 
of the 
breath just 
stops. 
The five 
senses 
stop and 
I 
get 
straight 
to 
the 
Citta
.  Sometimes I go through the breath but the breath
 comes up anyway.  I 
don’t do anything; I don’t make the breath happen. 
 I don’t look for the next stage of 
"meditation, and I don’t try and watch the breath or"
 put it in one particular place or 
make it this way or that way.  It comes up by itsel
f.  You watch but you are not doing 
anything. 
In order to allow the five physical senses of seein
"g, hearing, smelling, tasting and "
"touching to disappear in breath meditation, you tak"
"e one of them, and then only a part "
"of one of them, for example the sense of the physic"
"al touch of the breath, and you "
ignore all the others so that they can disappear.  
When the breath is the only part of 
"the five senses that you have left, allow that to d"
isappear too.  The breath is like a 
halfway house between the five senses and no senses
:  we just have a little bit of one 
of 
the 
senses. 
It’s 
only 
a 
"method, "
a 
means 
of 
prac
"tise, "
and 
all 
other 
types 
of 
meditation are the same.  It’s just a way of turnin
"g off the five senses, a way of "
"stopping them.  The way you stop is by not looking,"
" listening, feeling, or doing "
anything. 
After 
a 
while 
you 
stop 
scratching 
and 
yo
u 
stop 
moving. 
The 
body 
disappears; it’s finished.  When it’s gone the 
Citta
 come up.  And what do some 
meditators do when 
Citta
" come?  ‘Ah, that’s the "
Citta
.  Now I can really get 
it together.  I can make them expand.’  For goodnes
s sake leave them alone!  You’ve 
come so far; don’t spoil it now.  Stop completely. 
" Don’t say anything, just watch. "
A 
Citta
 may seem like a big deal:  it’s so powerful; it’s 
the biggest bliss in the 
"world.  So what!  Big deal!  It’s not ‘me’, not ‘mi"
"ne’, not a ‘self’.  It’s nothing to do "
with me.  It’s just a phenomenon in life that comes
 and goes.  So don’t get attached to 
it; don’t get involved with it.  When you don’t get
" attached and involved with it, you "
don’t interfere with it.  Non-interference means st
"opping, not doing anything.  So, "
when these 
Citta
" come up, please don’t do anything.  Please remembe"
r to look 
between you and the 
Citta
.  See what’s going on there; make sure you don’t s
poil 
the whole process that’s come up.  Because things h
ave disappeared and you’ve 
"stopped, your mind is still.  If the "
Citta
" is moving around, it means that you are "
moving around.  The 
Citta
 is a reflection of your mind.  If your mind is sti
ll 
292
"moving up and down, the "
Citta
" is also moving.  So be still, don’t do anything.  "
Don’t spoil the stillness. 
Doing 
nothing 
works 
almost 
like 
friction. 
It’s 
sto
pping 
all 
the 
movement 
by 
"becoming slower and slower, more and more still.  I"
t’s like Ajahn Chah’s famous leaf 
on a tree simile.  When the wind stops the leaf kee
ps on moving but less and less and 
"less.  So, don’t go blowing on that "
Citta
" and, using that simile, don’t do anything.  "
Leave it alone for goodness sake!  
"Don’t even make an effort to leave it alone, that’s"
more 
‘
doing
’. 
Please understand what stillness is: it’s a 
complete
 letting go.  Understand that it’s 
nothing to do with you: it’s not a self and it’s no
t under your control – it’s non-self.  
"Because you do nothing, the "
Citta
 stops moving.  It stays there.  You don’t have 
"to start thinking, ‘ah, now I can go into "
jhanas
’.  Stop it!  Stillness is like the simile of 
the magnifying glass and the sun.  If the magnifyin
g glass moves backwards and 
forwards the focus never becomes still enough to li
ght a fire.  If your 
Citta
" is still, "
"it will grow by itself.  If you do nothing, leaving"
" things completely alone, if the mind "
"doesn’t interfere or go anywhere, if the mind is co"
mpletely at peace – not looking for 
a destination and being as still as a statue – the 
Citta
 will come and it will grow by 
itself.  It will get brighter and brighter and more
" and more powerful, because the "
energy is going into the mind.  And then the 
jhanas
" happen, and wonderful states of "
happiness arise.  The thing that has really been st
"illed is the ‘doer’, the sense of "
activity. 
The full stilling of the ‘doer’ begins in first 
jhana
.  But on one sense the first 
jhana
shouldn’t be called a 
jhana
", because there is still a wobble there, "


", the "
movement of the mind onto the object and the holdin
"g onto the object.  However, it is "
so close it deserves to be a 
jhana
. 
The second 
jhana
 is when it really all happens:  full 
samadhi
", the perfection of "
samadhi
.  When the ‘doer’ has completely gone there is no 
potential to move.  That’s 
"a great way of describing it.  Not just ‘no doing’,"
" but no potential to do, no potential to "
move.  Now you really are stuck in stillness.  You’
ve stopped!  What does ‘you’ve 
293
stopped’ mean?  It means you can’t move; you can’t 
interfere any more.  All your 
powers of interference and involvement are complete
ly removed from you.  You have 
been disempowered.  Of course that very prospect is
 very scary because in that 
experience you’ve lost a lot of your sense of self.
  You are actually experiencing 
Metta
.  
Anatt

" is the emptiness of the ‘self’, and you understand"
" what that means, it "
"means that ‘will’, "
$
", is nothing to do with a being, it’s nothing to do"
 with me.  


$
:  it’s delusion that creates the 
kamma
" formations, the doing "
business.  And that doing business in turn creates 
consciousness.  Conscious activity 
keeps the five bodily senses and the sixth sense of
 the mind going.  That is standard 
Dependent Origination.  When delusion I being uproo
"ted, the "
kamma
 formations are 
stopping and consciousness is disappearing.  It’s f
ading in front of your attention. 
When things stop it’s amazing how much disappears. 
 The 
jhanas
 are like a machine 
stopping.  Craving stops and the five hindrances al
l stop.  These 
jhanas
 are stages of 
"stopping – right stopping, right stillness.  So ins"
"tead of calling it letting go, because "
that’s 
been 
a 
bit 
overused 
"now, "
we 
can 
call 
it 
stop
"ping, "
"finishing, "
not 
moving 
anymore.  If you do that you’ll see the whole stupi
dity of the journey of 

", "
"always going somewhere, trying to get somewhere, or"
" achieve something, thinking, ‘if "
"I do this, I’ll get that’.  It’s all craving and at"
tachment business. 
You can see that happening in people’s lives.  They
 are working so hard to pay off 
"their mortgages, so that once they’ve payed off the"
"ir mortgages, they can build a "
bigger 
house 
and 
have 
another 
mortgage. 
They 
call 
it 
investment. 
It’s 
not 
"investment, it’s stupidity.  It’s all ‘doing’, and "
it just creates this world of 

", of "
constant wandering.  Ajahn Chah used to say – I thi
nk it is also in the 
"
"

" – that the dog with mange is always running, think"
"ing, ‘If I get into the forest "
then the mange will go’.  It doesn’t go and then it
" thinks, ‘If I go into the city it will "
"go’.  It doesn’t go.  I thinks, ‘If I go into the w"
"ater it will go’, but the mange is still "
"there.  You think, ‘If I ordain as a novice then my"
 itch will go’.  It doesn’t go.  ‘If I get 
into 
jhanas
" then it will go’, but you never get into "
jhanas
 that way.  The itch is what 
stops you.  That itch is called craving and that cr
aving is always wanting and desiring.  
"It moves you, and that movement of the mind is what"
 prevents the stopping of the 
mind. 
294
"So, look upon your life as a journey.  When you sit"
" down and meditate, stop going "
"anywhere, have no destination, nothing to prove, no"
" more Brownie badges, no more "
"things you want to get, no wanting at all, complete"
" letting go, making stillness your "
"only goal.  Say to your self, “I will be still.  I "
am still!”  You’ll be afraid because it is a 
complete letting go of control.  Giving up and aban
"doning this ‘doer’, this ‘controller’ "
"inside, is like dying.  You become as still as deat"
h and things do die.  Allow that to 
"happen and don’t interfere, completely abandon ever"
ything.  Allow stillness to grow 
and grow and grow. 
Take away the wind of craving and the leaf gets mor
e and more still.  Keep on being 
"still and that stillness grows so incredibly still,"
 so motionless that the whole world 
"seems to be trembling, seems to be like an anthill,"
 or in chaos moving backwards and 
forwards like a chicken with it’s head cut off.  In
"side, you are absolutely still.  The "
sense of ‘self’ is dying.  The sense of ‘self’ is d
"isappearing.  The ‘doer’ has stopped, "
and after awhile all the stages of meditation that 
I’ve often described just happen.  
"You don’t make it happen.  You just sit and watch, "
and all the stages come up one 
"after the other in their right sequence, until you "
stop completely.  If that stopping 
continues for long enough you enter the 
jhana
 realms. 
Even from 
jhana
 to 
jhana
 things disappear.  The difference between the firs
t and 
second stage of 
jhana
 is the stopping of the movement of the mind onto t
he bliss and 
the holding onto that bliss.  That last little bit 
of ‘doing’ is almost like an echo of what 
was there before.  You only notice that when you ha
ve been in the first 
jhana
" many, "
many times and can compare it to the second 
jhana
.  Once you are out of the 
jhana
 it 
becomes obvious what those two different 
jhanas
 were.  You can see everything 
stopping.  Even the bliss and ecstasy stop as you m
ove from the second 
jhana
 through 
the third 
jhana
", to the fourth "
jhana
. 
"Things are stopping and just disappearing, flaking "
off you like the snake giving up its 
"skin, "
only 
in 
this 
case 
within 
the 
skin 
there 
is 
no
thing 
"left, "
and 
you 
go 
to 
the 
immaterial attainments.  These are just more states
" of stopping; the mind is stopping, "
‘knowing’ is stopping.  It’s an incredible experien
ce to see consciousness just unravel 
295
and completely stop and to see the incredible power
ful emptiness inside.  Nothing is 
left.  This is what 
samadhi
" is, and this is how you get into those incredible "
states of 
stillness called 
samadhi
. 
When you understand what 
jhanas
 are you understand why 

samadhi
 is just 
"complete, absolute nonsense.  "
)
 means momentary or temporary.  You can’t 
have momentary stillness.  If it only lasts for a m
oment it is not still.  That’s why 
when people say they go into 
jhana
" for ten minutes, I say, “"
Come off it
", that’s not "
possible!”  You are so still in these states of dee
p meditation that you can’t move for 
hours sometimes.  You are stuck there like the lady
" on the retreat in Ipoh, eight and a "
half hours in 
samadhi
.  I knew she was doing a lot of meditation.  I che
cked up on her 
"after I had my meal, and she was sitting in the hal"
"l completely relaxed, not moving.  "
"She hadn’t changed for hours, couldn’t change for h"
ours.  She was just like a statue.  
This is what happens in 
jhana
:  the mind and the body become so still.  This is 
called 
samadhi
.  The more still you are the deeper that 
samadhi
" is.  So, if that is what "
samadhi
" is, can you understand "
now that any type of ‘doing
’ whatsoever – any 
"interfering, poking, or prodding is just shaking up"
 what you should be leaving alone?  
You know now what the problem is.  Don’t shake your
" mind, don’t rock it.  Leave it "
"alone.  Allow stillness to build up powerfully, and"
 you too will experience those huge 
"long sits, hour after hour after hour.  So what’s t"
he point of all this?  The point of all 
this is that from all that stillness you understand
 and see through the ‘sense of self’; 
you understand


The most powerful insight of Buddhism is to see tha
"t there is no one in here.  Sure, I "
"say there are two halves to the sense of self, the "
"‘doer’ and the ‘knower’, but really it "
is the ‘doer’ that feeds the ‘knower’.  Because we 
are doing things consciousness 
keeps on going.  It is 
$
 that creates the consciousness.  So when you actua
lly 
"stop that part of the mind, the active/reactive, cr"
"aving part of the mind, the other one "
is 
fatally 
flawed 
as 
well: 
consciousness 
can’t 
sur
vive 
long. 
This 
is 
why 
consciousness starts to die in the 
jhanas
 and also why you go through those 
jhanas
 and 
immaterial attainments naturally.  It’s just consci
ousness stopping.  It is practically 
imperceptible in ‘neither perception nor non-percep
"tion’, and then finally goes into "
296

.  

" means cessation, the stopping of things:  the comp"
lete stopping of 
"time, consciousness, and all that is perceived and "
felt.  
Panna#
:  all that 
"is perceived and felt has completely ceased, there "
is nothing left.  That is actually 
"experienced.  So when you come out of that state, t"
here is no argument anymore.  
There is no misunderstanding about what the Buddha 
was talking about.  Nor is there 
any doubt anymore about the path into 
samadhi
", its importance, and its necessity. "
It’s essential to at least experience a first 
jhana
 and to actually see things stopping; 
"because if you can’t stop that much, how on earth d"
o you think you can understand 
what this ‘doer’ business is and what the ‘self’ is
"?  If you haven’t uncovered it yet, it "
"means you haven’t got close enough, and you haven’t"
 actually seen the process yet.  
You are still a ‘doer’.  Anyone who hasn’t got into
 a 
jhana
" is still a ‘doer’, just a "
"controller, still on the journey.  They haven’t sto"
"pped, nor have they reached any "
destination.  They are just into 

", wandering around – if not in the world then "
from monastery to monastery – wandering around in t
heir minds from thought to 
"thought, idea to idea, concept to concept, goal to "
"goal, destination to destination. "
"There is never an end to destinations, never an end"
" to goals, so just stop the whole lot "
"in one go.  Stop, give up, and abandon, and then yo"
u’ll understand what 
jhana
 is.  
You’ll understand why it’s called 

samadhi
" – right, correct, perfect stopping.  "
"You’ll understand why we practise renunciation, why"
" we have all these precepts, why "
"we let go of possessions, and why we stop doing thi"
ngs.  You understand why we 
have huts in this monastery and why we try and make
 this monastery so that there are 
very few jobs and duties.  If the whole thing falls
 apart you do nothing:  be a person 
who completely stops.  If you can be a ‘stopper’ in
 this meditation then you can get 
into 
jhanas
.  I far prefer that to having the most beautiful h
uts and beds and sewing 
rooms and all that sort of stuff.  We need more 
Ariyas
" in this world, not more "
"
	"
"(monks huts).  We need more Stream Winners, Once Re"
"turners, Non Returners, and "

.  We need more 
jhana
" attainers, not more brooms. "
Get the priorities right.  We have all this time in
" the monastery, so just sit down and "
"stop.  Once you get the hang of it, it is the easie"
st thing in the world to do – sit down 
and stop.  Don’t try to get all those other things 
"out of the way first of all, stop first.  "
297
There is no end of things to get out of the way.  Y
ou will die before you get all your 
jobs and projects out of the way.  Look at this mon
astery.  This monastery has been 
going for twenty-one years and it’s still not finis
hed.  It never will be.  There will 
"always be something to do here, so don’t think, ‘oh"
", once I get this monastery correct, "
once 
I learn 
this 
"chant, "
once 
I 
understand 
the 
+
", "
or 
once 
I’ve 
learned 
the 
%
", then I’ll meditate’.  Don’t waste time; just stop"
" now!  When you sit here, "
stop.  Just sit here and watch and all these amazin
g things happen.  That’s the way to 
get into 
jhanas
" – not by trying to get there, not by doing things."
  Understand that 
‘doing’ prevents stillness building up.  By stoppin
"g, stillness arrives and grows like a "
"fire, like a flame. "
When stillness really takes off it’s the flame of 
jhanas
.  The mind is so still it 
generates incredible states of mind and gives you a
ll the necessary data you need.  
You understand you got there by stopping the ‘doing
"’ – no craving, no "
$
.  
Things have disappeared and consciousness is peacef
ul.  This is bliss.  All this rushing 
"around that I have been doing, all this wanting and"
" craving, that was the wrong way.  "
You get the message at last about what renunciation
 truly is and why people are 
"monks and nuns.  When you get that message, then yo"
u are sweet for the rest of this 
life. 
You know what 
jhana
s
 are.  You know how to give up craving and how to s
top the 
cycle of 

" with right stillness.  When you get that still, th"
e whole universe 
stops.  You are on the way out of

it was even more essential than the Four Noble Trut

statement of the

scussions I had on my tour of the 
United States there was much talk about such things
".  As many of you will know, the "
Christians 
in 
the 
United 
States 
have 
been 
forcing 
t
he 
issue 
of 
what 
they 
call 
"‘intelligent design’, wanting to explain the origin"
 of this universe as ‘God-caused’.  
Because they are running the debate in the U.S. and
" they have a huge influence there, "
"they are deceiving many people.  Because of that, a"
s a Buddhist monk travelling in 
"that country, I was often asked about the Buddha’s "
"response to this, and in particular "
people wanted to know the Buddhist view with regard
 to the origins of the world. 
"Christians are often very materialistically minded,"
 only seeing nature as basically the 
four elements.  The result of that is to not really
 understand or include the nature of 
"the mind.  So, often the debate is just on material"
 things.  But I’m going to extend it 
"beyond that, into the mind, into the nature of the "
mind.  As a physicist before I 
"became a monk, the one thing that I do know is that"
 the nature of form – what we call 
the four elements – is that it is empty of everythi
"ng.  As many of you would know, the "
mat that you sit on is not solid:  it is made up of
 atoms and 99.9999% space – it’s 
mostly empty.  And if you could look inside that at
om you would see that it is just this 
smear of potential places where electrons can be fo
und.  It is basically empty; there is 
just a tiny speck in the middle called a nucleus.  
When you look into that nucleus you 
find that it is full of holes as well.  Basically t
here is nothing there except 
fields of 
energy
".  There is nothing really solid, just the emptines"
s of phenomena.  Scientists 
would agree with that straight away. 
The reason I bring this up is because when people t
alk about the creation of the 
"material universe, they usually say, “How on earth "
can you create something out of 
"nothing”.  It’s a valid point, because in fact you "
can’t create something out of nothing.  
That’s why people think there has to be some sort o
"f creator, a of ‘God figure’, to "
make that irrational jump from nothing into somethi
ng.  The point I am making is that 
because there is nothing in this material world to 
"begin with, just these plays of "
"energy, it’s just an illusion.  It is just a wrong "
"way of thinking, a culturally induced "
300
"delusion, to think of things as being solid and to "
think that there is actually matter 
here.  
The four elements are just ways of perceiving
. 
"As many scientists know, "
"
**"
", the emptiness of any essence, of any solidity, or"
"thing-ness in the matter which we see and feel, is "
an established fact of science.  
"Because there is nothing actually here, the arising"
 of this universe out of nothing 
"becomes plausible.  Sure, something cannot come out"
" of nothing, but a zero sum (rise "
& fall) can come out of nothing and that is what th
is universe is.  I use that as an 
example 
so 
that 
you 
can 
understand 
what 
that 
famous
saying 
of 
Assajji 
means:  
"‘whatever arises, that causal arising out of nothin"
"g, can also cease into nothing. "
You realize there is nothing here to begin with.  A
"s you probe into it, you penetrate "
"the illusion of a self, a soul, an entity, in the f"
ive 

" of being, just as a physicist "
probes into matter and takes it 
"apart, "
"analyses it,"
 and sees that there is nothing 
substantial there.  The four elements are 
Metta
 (non-self).  The sense of 
Metta
 being an 
"essence, "
a 
thing 
in 
"itself, "
something 
persisting 
wh
ich 
is 
always 
"there, "
that 
is 
impossible
.  It’s basically a delusion to think that there is
 something in this universe 
"which is solid and persistent, which will be there "
for ever and ever.  Scientists have 
proved 
that 
again 
and 
"again, "
and 
it’s 
really 
irrati
onal 
and 
untenable 
to 
believe 
otherwise. 
"Of course, when we start looking into our mind at t"
he five 

", emptiness is "
"what we are also expected to see, and it is somethi"
ng 
"
"
 saw straight away.  
"Origination from nothing is just an empty process, "
and because it is an empty causal 
"process it is also subject to cessation, to disappe"
"aring, to vanishing – to going back to "
"an original source, if you want to say that.  Empti"
"ness to begin with, emptiness in the "
end – anything else becomes completely irrational a
nd untenable.  Even the idea of an 
"eternal ‘consciousness’ that doesn’t change, is tan"
tamount to being no consciousness 
at all.  
+**
" or consciousness needs change, needs some contrast"
" to give it life, as "
any psychologist would know.  This is rational.  Yo
u have to know from your own 
experience that whatever is stable disappears:  you
" cannot see it, perceive it, or know "
"it, because the nature of knowing is contrast or di"
scrimination. 
301
"Now, this might just be words, but the practice of "
our meditation reveals the truth of 
what I’ve just said.  To see things disappear is th
e very heart of the meditation 
"process.  When we say to ‘calm’ things, it means to"
 calm things to the point of 
disappearance.  The Buddha once said that 
!!
 is 
!!#
$

", ‘the "
"quietening of all the formations’, that is, the cal"
ming all of the movements and all of 
the makings.  Everything is calmed down to absolute
" stillness.  Of course, people "
"might have some theories about what stillness is, b"
ut the experience in the 
jhanas
", "
when the mind starts to experience deep states of s
"tillness, shows that stillness means "
that things disappear. 
"As many of you here know, I learnt my first "
Pali
 from the 
+
 and I value that 
study.  I was forced to do it because in the early 
years of our tradition very few monks 
knew the Vinaya and there were some silly things be
ing done by us.  We thought we 
were being strict according to the 
+
", but in fact we didn’t really understand what "
we were doing and we had no real guidance.  The boo
"k available at that time, the "
‘
"+
"
"’, was a brave attempt, but it was written by a pri"
nce of Thailand who 
in fact got many things wrong.  And since he was ro
"yalty, no one was willing to "
"question it, and so the mistakes lasted for over a "
century and they are still there.  I 
learnt to read 
Pali
 from the 
+
.  That’s a wonderful place to start to learn P

"li, "
because in the 
+
 you see the common usage of those words in the dow
n to earth 
"practical actions of life, which is what the "
+
" is all about.  It’s not theories, it’s "
"what people actually do, and there you have the gro"
und of language.  All language 
"starts with the world of seeing, touching, hearing,"
" smelling, and tasting.  It then gets "
adapted to the metaphysical world of thoughts and t
"heories, ideas and philosophies, "
even religious philosophies. 
When you ground your understanding of language in t
he physical world that is where 
you 
find 
the 
deeper 
"meanings, "
and 
then 
you 
can 
appl
y 
those 
meanings 
to 
the 
metaphysical 
stuff. 
In 
the 
+
I 
came 
across 
the 
seven 

samatha
dhammas
 at the very end of the 
%
" rules, and I gained the understanding that "
to 
samatha
 things means to deal with them and settle them so 
that they are not 
business anymore.  They are dealt with and they dis
appear from your agenda.  They 
literally vanish; they are not there anymore.  That
’s how I understood the word 
302
samatha
 and also the word 
"
"
 because the two are used synonymously in that 
section of the 
+
.  That understanding of the meaning of those words
 in ordinary 
usage gave me the insight into what the path of med
itation is.  It is to calm all the 
"business down, to settle it, so that it all disappe"
ars. 
You can see that the idea of settling things into d
"isappearance, into "

", into "
"cessation, is the whole theme of our monastic life."
"  Sure, we build huts in order to "
"settle the problem of accommodation, so the problem"
" is finished, dissolved, and we "
don’t have to do that anymore.  We build our halls 
so that we don’t have to do that 
anymore.  We eat our one meal of the day so that fo
r the rest of the day we don’t have 
"to do it anymore.  It’s all about calming, settling"
" the business of our lives, so we can "
"all disappear, so that we have no business to do.  "
"When we settle things down, it "
means the business disappears. 
I spend a lot of time settling other peoples busine
ss.  I settled some funeral business 
"this afternoon.  A person dies, we do the ceremony,"
 and then we don’t have to think 
"about it any more.  Unfortunately, some people crea"
te business.  As a monk I try not 
"to make more business, but often other people make "
that business for me.  So settling 
business is my duty as the senior monk.  But I look
 to those early years when I made 
very little business – the years when I could just 
sit down and meditate without having 
anything to think about or anything to worry about.
  I understood what progress I 
could make in my meditation by doing hardly anythin
"g at all:  by living simply, not "
"making business, doing projects, or writing letters"
.  I even neglected my family; the 
first time I visited them was after seven years as 
"a monk.  I didn’t write to my friends, "
except maybe once a year at Christmas.  Simplifying
 my life meant I was 
samatha
-
"ing, calming, lessening, and quelling all the busin"
ess of my life.  I understood that the 
"path of being a monk was that of a renunciant, livi"
"ng outside of the world, not "
"worrying about what other people think of you, not "
even your family.  That’s not what 
should run your life as a monk.  What runs your lif
e as a monk is something else:  it is 
the ability to leave the world and not engage in it
", not to make your life more "
complicated but to simplify it.  This is one of the
 things that I stress to each one of 
you.  If you live in this monastery your life is on
ly as complicated as you make it.  
And your success in meditation will be inversely pr
oportional to your complexity.  
303
How many things are you doing and what do you spend
 your time on?  Because we 
take on responsibility some of us have to deal with
 complexity.  Many of you do not; 
"you make it for yourselves.  Be careful, "
samatha
" things.  End things, don’t start things. "
I remember Ajahn Chah always said he liked the endi
"ng of things, never the starting "
of things.  So see if you can end as much as possib
le.  Don’t end one project and start 
two; end one project and start none.  Be a simple l
iving person who does very little.  
The only project that you have to do is to come out
" in the morning, do your chores, "
"eat, and then go back to your hut and literally end"
 things.  That is the path of being a 
monk.  When you find that path and you practise thi
s idea of 
samatha
"-ing things, "
quelling 
"things, "
renouncing 
"things, "
you 
find 
that 
t
hings 
disappear. 
You 
are 
"experiencing a vanishing in your life, a vanishing "
of concerns for the world. 
Often 
people 
are 
too 
concerned 
with 
their 
families.
That 
is 
an 
"attachment, "
an 
obstacle.  It’s okay to look after your families to
" some extent, but in your early years, "
"try to move away as much as possible, to cut them o"
ff; in other words you say ‘no’ for 
"a while.  I have done that for many years, and it’s"
 wonderful to be free of my family.  
Even when I visited them there was no attachment fo
"r my mother, or my brother, or "
anybody else.  If they die tomorrow my faculties wi
ll not change.  If they died right 
now I would never be sad.  This is detachment.  And
 it is wonderful to be able to see 
that in a person.  When I went to visit them recent
"ly, I was at ease with these things.  "
They have lived good lives but they are going to di
"e one day.  So, there is a quelling "
and calming of the business of your family duties. 
 There is a quelling of the other 
things you want to achieve in life.  What do you wa
"nt to achieve but calm, peace, "
"emptiness, stillness, and things disappearing; beca"
use if the objects of your mind 
don’t disappear you won’t disappear.  You are what 
you do.  You are your projects.  
That 
is 
what 
makes 
this 
idea 
of 
a 
‘self’ 
and 
gives 
rise 
to 
more 

", "
more 
"wanderings, again and again and again.  If you want"
 that you are just asking for 
"dukkha"
", again and again and again.  As the great "

" said, ‘it’s only "
"dukkha"
arising and 
"dukkha"
 passing away’; nothing more than that.  Don’t add 
more to what 
the great 

" said, because that’s all there is:  "
"dukkha"
 arising and 
"dukkha"
 passing 
"away, nothing more.  See if you can allow "
"dukkha"
" to finish once and for all, so that "
there is nothing left:  
#
!!
 – 
!!
 with nothing remaining.  I am just 
304
quoting the 
"suttas"
 here; they are the final reference of our traditio
n.  We understand 
this because the more we follow the teaching of cal
"ming things down, of simplifying, "
the more things vanish and the more peace and happi
ness we experience. 
There is a beautiful quote from the J

"taka Tales that, although it is found nowhere else "
"in the suttas, fits in so well with what the Buddha"
" said elsewhere, as well as fitting "
one’s experience.  The Buddha said that the more yo
u abandon the five senses the 
more 
you 
experience 
"
"
", "
happiness. 
If 
you 
want 
to 
have 
complete 
"
"
(
"#
"
) you have to abandon the five senses completely.  
What the Buddha is 
saying here is not just about subduing the senses w
"hen you sit cross legged, it’s "
actually about ‘letting go’ of the these things at 
"all times in your life, disengaging "
"from the world of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, a"
nd touches.  What other people say is 
"only sound, that’s all.  No need to argue with it, "
"no need to get involved in it, no need "
"to think, ‘that’s a nice sound’.  The correct "
Dhamma
 is that it’s just sound and that’s 
all.  Please let it go; don’t involve yourself with
 that world.  Don’t involve yourself 
"with the world of tastes:  beautiful coffee or tea,"
" too hot or too sweet, nice food or not "
so nice food.  It’s just a lot of suffering. 
What’s the point of trying to find the nicest food?
  It just leads to a lot of suffering.  
"You put it in your mouth and eat it, gobble it down"
".  If you have a choice that’s fine, "
but if you haven’t any choice just eat what you’ve 
got.  It’s only a couple of seconds 
of taste and then it’s all gone.  What’s the big th
ing about desiring food?  The desire 
for food lasts for such a long time before you eat 
it but the actual experience is just a 
few 
"minutes, "
and 
then 
it’s 
all 
gone. 
It’s 
all 
just
"delusion, "
"make-believe, "
and 
anticipation – that’s all desire for food really is
.  It is the same with the coffee 
afterwards – in fact you do not really taste the co
"ffee anyway, you are all talking to "
each other.  So what’s the point:  you could have r
ubbish coffee and you wouldn’t 
know.  You’re not mindful of what you are drinking.
The point of all this is that we should try to aban
don this sensory world.  Even the 
"jokes and all the talking is just sound, that’s all"
.  Someone tells a funny story or a 
lively story but it’s just sound.  The more you aba
ndon the five-sense world and the 
"body, the more happiness you get.  What we are doin"
g is calming the five-sense 
305
"world.  When we are speaking we don’t speak loudly,"
" or harshly, or hurriedly.  We "
"speak softly, calmly, almost to the point that soun"
"d disappears.  We move softly, "
"calmly, and slowly, so that we almost disappear.  T"
he whole monastery goes calmly 
"and slowly, so there is nothing left.  We’ve built "
our huts and our walking paths and 
now they disappear.  That’s what they are there for
.  As it says in the reflections on 
using your huts:  it’s just for the enjoyment of so
litude (
  
"), solitude "
and calmness for the practising of 
samatha
".  Eventually, sitting in your hut, your hut "
just disappears from your consciousness.  You are n
ot there to look at your hut and 
make it look beautiful; you just have to keep it cl
ean enough for it to disappear from 
your consciousness.  You eat enough for the idea of
 food to disappear from you 
consciousness.  You wear robes or a blanket if you 
"are cold, so that the whole idea of "
clothing disappears from your consciousness.  You d
o it for the sake of disappearance.  
"That’s what we mean by the path of calming, the pat"
h of emptiness and disappearing. 
"We do reflections on the body, ‘the body contemplat"
ions’.  Why?  Why is that an 
important meditation?  It has a purpose.  The purpo
"se is for your body to disappear, so "
that it’s 
samatha
"-ed, so that it’s not a problem any more.  In fact "
it just disappears 
from your agenda.  That’s the purpose of doing body
 contemplation.  If you can’t sit 
down and get into 
jhanas
 – 
which are the sign that the body has disappeared wi
th its 
five senses – there is still some holding in there.
  You are still attached to the body; 
you still can’t let it go. 
It’s fascinating to see why you can’t get into a 
jhana
.  It’s not through lack of effort; 
it’s not through not putting in the hours.  The hou
rs are important but that’s not the 
crucial thing.  Sometimes people can meditate for t
"heir whole lifetime, eight hours ,or "
"ten hours a day, and still not get into these state"
s.  Why?  It’s because there is still 
"something they are unwilling to let go of, unwillin"
"g to renounce, and because they are "
"unwilling to let go and renounce it, it never disap"
pears.  They just cannot 
samatha
 it; 
"they can’t calm it down into disappearance.  So, th"
is is why the more we understand 
the emptiness of these phenomena – what we call the
 material world – the more we 
see that there is so much that we add on to what we
" see, so much we add on to what "
we hear. 
306
I was talking earlier this evening about the cultur
"al conditioning that we have, because "
I have received a paper from some scientist about t
he nature of what used to be called 
#
 lights.  They have a scientific explanation:  they
 are just phenomena with causes 
"and effects, they are not "
#
", they’re not heavenly beings.  But it’s amazing ho"
w 
people want to add on these heavenly beings.  I was
 reading newspaper while waiting 
for the funeral this afternoon.  I only half read t
"he article, but some scientist had with "
great effect been debunking all these ‘weeping Virg
ins’ and ‘blood coming out of 
"statues’ in Catholicism, by finding a good explanat"
"ion for it.  Nevertheless, even "
"though there is a fascinating and good explanation,"
" if people want to believe, they will "
add on to the experience what they want to see.  Th
is is the problem:  our attachments 
to ideas and views stop us from seeing the truth. 
There is a famous story from the early years of Wat
" Pah Pong, when Ajahn Chah was "
a young monk.  On the day in the week when everyone
" goes to the monastery, this "
man was coming to the monastery in his car but the 
rain was pouring down and he got 
stuck in the mud.  He was worried about how he was 
going to get to the monastery 
because it was raining so hard.  He wasn’t willing 
to get out of the car and get wet 
"himself, but then he saw Ajahn Chah coming out of t"
"he forest.  Ajahn Chah, this great "
"monk with such humility, got behind the car and pus"
hed it out of the mud.  Ajahn 
"Chah’s robes were all wet and muddy, and his face w"
as splattered with mud.  He 
"thought, ‘Ah!  That’s what you call a great monk.  "
It doesn’t matter how much respect 
"he’s got in the neighbourhood, he is willing to giv"
e an ordinary layperson a push in 
"the mud, even though he is going to get all wet and"
" dirty.  That’s a real monk, not like "
some of these monks who sit up there and expect to 
be treated like kings or royalty’.  
This guy was so impressed.  When he got to the hall
" just one or two minutes later, he "
saw the 
%
 being recited with Ajahn Chah sitting in the middl
"e, dry with no "
"mud on him.  ‘Wow!’ he thought, ‘psychic powers, an"
d I’ve seen it’.  Of course many 
of you know what the true story was.  Ajahn Paitoon
", a relation of Ajahn Chah who "
"was a novice at the time, looked very similar to Aj"
"ahn Chah, and as a novice he "
wasn’t in the 
%
 recitation.  He had seen this man coming and being
 a kind 
monk he pushed the man out of the mud.  But because
 of his physical resemblance to 
"Ajahn Chah, in the dark and in the rain, it was eno"
"ugh for this guy to say, “No, that "
was Ajahn Chah”.  And no matter how many times Ajah
"n Paitoon has said, “That was "
307
"not Ajahn Chah, that was me”, this guy never accept"
"s it, and he will never admit that "
he was wrong.  He wants a miracle so much and that’
s the miracle he has.  That story 
went all round Ubon.  I think it’s still part of th
e history of the great teacher Ajahn 
Chah. 
"We make so much of things that aren’t really there,"
 simply because of belief.  That’s 
"why in regard to views, no matter where we hear the"
"m, we always have to doubt them "
and challenge them.  It doesn’t matter which monk s
"ays these things, don’t believe "
them.  The only thing you can trust is either the 
"suttas"
 or your own experience – not 
"other monks, not me, not any other Kruba Ajahns, no"
"body, just the "
"suttas"
 and your 
own experience.  If you really want to challenge th
ings you have to be courageous and 
iconoclastic.  Iconoclastic means challenging sacre
"d cows, no matter where they come "
from.  This is how we deepen our experience.  When 
we see what we are attached to 
"and what those things are, they disappear, they "
samatha
.  They only arise from a 
"cause.  The causes are delusion, our sense of ego a"
"nd self, and that’s what we protect.  "
When people are challenged they get defensive and a
ngry.  That’s a sign that we’ve 
"added a ‘self’, a ‘me’, to that idea.  We’ve formed"
 the ‘I believe’ connection that’s the 
cause 
of 
so 
many 
arguments 
and 
of 
so 
much 
obstructi
on 
on 
the 
path 
to 
things 
disappearing and settling. 
It’s important to have some degree of right view in
 order to attain 
jhanas
.  Without 
right view it’s difficult to get 
jhanas
 simply because there is something that one keeps 
"holding onto, that one attaches to as ‘me’, as ‘min"
e’.  Because of that one is unwilling 
to abandon and let go to the point of entering 
jhanas
.  A lot of times the attachment 
comes from wrong view:  there is an ‘I’ in there so
"mewhere, a ‘self’, a ‘me’, holding "
on to something.  I’ve explained before that attach
ment is like a hand.  The hand has 
"two ends to it, the end which grasps and the end wh"
ich initiates the grasping.  One of 
the greatest insights that helped me on the path wa
"s not to look at the end that grasps, "
but to look at the end that initiates the grasping.
"   That is, not to look at what I was "
grasping but at who or what was doing that grasping
".  When you look at that, then you "
can actually unravel grasping.  It’s always the min
"d doing this, the ‘me’, the ‘ego’, the "
‘self’; it is the mind that wants to exist
6
"  The craving ‘to be’, "
!tanha
", is holding on "
to things and making things exist.  When you strike
" down that idea, that view, the "
308
"opposite is true.  The less ‘self’ you have, the mo"
re things are allowed to disappear.  
"The more you can renounce, the more things disappea"
r. 
The 
jhanas
 are the first stage of disappearance.  It’s tough 
to allow things to disappear.  
"People just don’t want to let go of their bodies, t"
"houghts, or hearing.  Why is it that "
sound disturbs you in meditation?  As Ajahn Chah fa
"mously said, “Sound does not "
"disturb anyone, you disturb the sound”.  That’s a p"
owerful teaching.  What it means is 
that the ‘self’ wants to hear and that’s why it lit
erally goes out and looks for sounds.  
The mind wants to have a body to cling onto and tha
t’s why it looks for feelings in the 
body and won’t allow this body to disappear.  The m
ind gets attached even to the 
breathing and that’s why it won’t let the breath di
sappear and vanish.  As soon as the 
"breath vanishes you think, ‘Ah!  I’m not breathing’"
", and you want to breathe again.  "
Even when nothing is happening and you get into a s
"ense of stillness, the mind freaks "
out.  You think if nothing is happening it means th
at you are about to disappear.  This 
"is the fear, the movement, the trembling, that caus"
es the five senses start again and 
this body to exist.  It is the attachment of this m
"ind to the body, the delusion that this "
"is mine, and if I let these things go, ‘Ah, what wi"
ll happen?’  It’s fear of the 
Dhamma
or fear of meditation. 

gets 
you 
past 
these 
attachments 
through 
two 
causes
: 
either 
through 
understanding or through the sheer pleasure of it. 
 The understanding allows you to 
"see that there is no one here, so you just let go n"
"aturally.  The pleasure, the bliss of the "
"deep meditations, can be so peaceful that – even th"
"ough you don’t agree with this, "
"even though it doesn’t make sense, even though it s"
cares the shit out of you –the 
"attachments don’t matter, its just too joyful and t"
"oo blissful, so you just go right "
through.  This is actually where the mind can disen
gage from the body.  When the 
"mind disengages from the body, the body disappears."
  That’s called 
jhana
.  When I 
"say it disappears, I mean not just the body but als"
"o the echoes of the body, the echoes "
of the five senses.  Things like space and time are
 all connected to this body.  The 
body 
moves 
and 
thus 
creates 
space/time. 
The 
mind 
m
oves 
because 
of 
craving 
"craving, craving for something in this five-sense w"
orld.  You’re disturbed by sound 
because you are interested in sound; you are actual
"ly attached to hearing, that’s all it "
"is.  You’re attached to feeling, to the body; you’r"
e attached to the breath.  You see 
309
"these things disappear, you’ve "
samatha
-ed them.  At last you don’t have a body:  you 
"can’t feel it, it’s gone.  You can’t hear sound, an"
d you can’t even think.  The mind has 
"become so still, its ability to control the world t"
hrough thought has disappeared and 
vanished.  You’ve 
samatha
-ed it.  When you’ve 
samatha
-ed it the body vanishes from 
your existence. 

-ed means that it has 

"-ed temporarily – it’s gone.  People say, “But "
it’s still there”.  That’s not the point.  If you a
"re not observing it, it’s gone.  That’s "
basic quantum theory if you want to be scientific a
bout it.  You need an observer to 
create reality.  That’s the experience you have in 
the deep meditations.  The body 
simply is not there and you don’t give a damn about
 it.  If you can achieve that state 
you know that ‘body contemplation’ has done its wor
"k.  Its purpose is to let go, to "
"allow things to vanish, to see a world, "
kama 
", disappear.  You’ve heard me say "
before that it’s very important to experience thing
s vanishing and disappearing. 
"To understand this, the best simile is the simile o"
f the tadpole leaving the water as a 
frog.  Only when the tadpole has left the water as 
a frog can it really know what water 
is.  Before then it may have had theories about wat
"er, it may have heard about water "
from this monk or that monk or this Kruba Ajahn or 
"that book or whatever, but it will "
not know what water is.  When the tadpole becomes a
" frog and leaves the water, it "
"knows from its own experience, not just from belief"
s or theories.   It now sees what 
it’s like when there is no water left.  It’s a powe
rful insight which changes the whole 
way the frog looks at life.  This is what happens w
hen you gain the 
jhanas
.  You’ve 
samatha
-ed the body and the five senses and they’ve disapp
eared.  You know what 
Nirodha
 means now; you know what the body is.  You won’t u
nderstand the body by 
just contemplating it up and down if it hasn’t yet 
disappeared; all you will know are 
"the changes of the body, not the essence of a body."
  In the same way the tadpole might 
know the colours in the water and might know the co
"ld or the heat in the water, but it "
won’t know the essence of the water until it’s disa
ppeared. 
Body contemplation reaches its fulfilment when the 
body disappears; that’s its job.  
Its purpose is to get you into 
jhanas
", nothing more than that.  When the "
jhanas
 happen 
then you will have an opportunity of knowing what t
he body is and what the five 
310
senses are.  Before that it’s just theory and belie
"fs; it’s not substantial, and it will "
never get you anywhere.  It will just make you argu
e more with other people.  That’s 
what is meant by being attached to views not experi
ence.  When you get into 
jhanas
they will be the foundation that gives you the data
 for Enlightening insight.  At least 
you’ve known that what arose from a cause has now c
"eased.  The body has gone, you "
"understand that.  That is how the Buddha taught, an"
d you gain incredible faith in the 
"teachings of the Buddha, faith based on your own ex"
perience.  When you see your 
mind disappear you understand what the teachings re
ally mean.  You understand that 
the whole purpose of going through the 
jhanas
 and the 

 (immaterial) attainments 
is to see the whole world of the mind disappear. 
"In the medieval period of Christianity, long after "
"the time of the Buddha, some of the "
Christian ascetics started to talk about union with
 God.  What does that mean?  If any 
of you experience a first 
jhana
 you’ll understand what that means.  Many of us wer
e 
brought up in a Christian tradition and can look at
 the experience of a first 
jhana
 and 
understand why anyone from that Christian tradition
 would interpret and perceive that 
as union with God.  That union is 
#&&
", the oneness of mind.  The God perception "
is the incredible 
"
"
" of that state, the incredible power and bliss.  I "
remember as 
a young man how I used to go to rock concerts.  The
re was this guy called Eric 
Clapton playing for ‘The Queen’.  People would shou
"t, “He’s God.  Eric Clapton is "
God.  He’s God.  He’s God”.  The reason they would 
say that is because they 
developed incredible bliss.  You can really get hig
h on that music.  This is an example 
that ‘God’ is what gives you enormous happiness and
 power.  It’s very easy to see 
why Christians and even Hindus take those experienc
es as ultimate reality:  the same 
"consciousness, unchanging, and pure and blissful. "
If you experience those states and you know them fr
"om your own experience, you’ll "
also 
understand 
why 
those 
states 
that 
occur 
just 
be
fore 
the 
jhanas
were 
called 
!
citta
 by the Buddha.  The five hindrances have been over
come and the 
mind is incredibly radiant.  That’s the 
Citta
", brilliant and bright.  You may even "
apply that description to the first 
jhana
".  You still have a bit of a wobble there, enough "
"to see or get a handle on the mind state, on the ob"
"ject of your mind in that experience, "
and it is 
!
" (very bright, radiant) for sure, powerful and pure"
.  The great thing 
311
about these experiences is that when you come out o
f the meditation you are able to 
understand the framework of the incredible teaching
s of the 
"suttas"
.  You understand 
that the 
!
citta
 – 
"so pure, so still, so powerful – is also subject to"
 change.  It 
arises from a cause and is subject to an ending.  P
eople who don’t understand that – 
like the Christians – will take those experiences t
o be the ultimate.  This is where 
people get the mistaken idea of a persisting consci
ousness.  They have the experience 
of those 
jhanas
", but they do not have enough understanding of the "
Dhamma
 to really 
"penetrate and understand that this too will pass, t"
"hat this too is a causal thing, this too "
is just made up of elements which are of the nature
 to cease.

"’s statement, ‘All those "
dhammas
 that are of the nature to 
"arise, or come into being, the Buddha taught their "
"cause and he taught their ending, "
"their cessation, their going out of existence’.  In"
jhanas
 you have the experience of 
"things ending, of the five-sense world and thoughts"
 ending.  You understand what the 
Dhamma
 is.  One of the greatest experiences from calming 
down during the 
jhanas
 is 
the ending of ‘will’.  What a powerful experience t
hat is:  to see that this part of the 
mind that has always been there – the potential to 
"will, to choose, to argue, to make "
"your own decisions, to move the mind whichever way "
you want:  that potential which 
"creates the words that come out of your mouth, whic"
h creates the movement of the 
"body, which is the driving force of your life, that"
 whole movement that is so essential 
to your perception of a ‘self’ – completely disappe
ars.  Will goes when you see that 
happening.  You can never again think that an 

 after 
%!!
 can move to 
"do anything.  Doing is suffering; moving, speaking,"
" going, coming, and all trembling "
is suffering.  I don’t mean trembling out of fear; 
I mean the trembling that moves you 
"out of stillness, out of this wonderful nothingness"
" – that is suffering, "
"dukkha"
.  When 
you see in this way that all the arising of comings
 and goings and speech or whatever 
"is all suffering, it is because you’ve experienced "
the second 
jhana
.  You’ll know for 
"sure what the end is:  it’s the end of will, the en"
d of craving.  The end of doing things 
means that the world stops.  Not just the external 
world but also the internal world.  
"The mind stops.  The mind is that which moves, it i"
s the house builder. 
312
The mind creates; this is what it does.  Sometimes 
we know things for what they are; 
sometimes we know things by their function.  And th
at is what the mind does.  In 
Pali
citta
" (mind) also means, variegation, colour, and beauty"
.  It creates this world of 
‘beauty’.  It’s interesting to understand and get t
o the heart of the way words are used 
in 
Pali
.  The original meaning of the word often reveals s
ome deeper facets of what 
the word truly means.  When the mind stops ‘willing
"’, when it stops moving, then the "
mind starts to disappear.  The second 
jhana
 is in one sense a very powerful turning 
"point in the mind:  because ‘will’ has stopped, not"
hing is moving.  After a time the 
second 
jhana
 settles down into the third 
jh

na
 and the third 
jh

na
 settles down into the 
fourth 
jhana
.  Things change as the whole world starts to vanis
"h, and space vanishes.  "
The first 

jhana
 is the perception of infinite space.  In the secon
d 

jhana
space vanishes.  How do these things happen?  It’s 
just that the whole concept of 
space has no meaning anymore; the idea of a mind or
 body in some sort of space has 
no meaning anymore.  Because the mind is still in t
he equanimity of the fourth 
jhana
"and is completely one-pointed, that concept vanishe"
s. 
All that is left is consciousness.  That consciousn
"ess has no bounds, no limits, and is "
"infinite and nothing at the same moment, which is a"
 sign that consciousness itself is 
on the edge of extinction.  As consciousness exting
uishes there is nothing left.  The 
"mind knows nothing, which is why the third "

jhana
 is called the perception of 
nothingness.  At this point the 
citta
 is vanishing.  You experience this.  It is no long
er 
a theory that you argue about; you experience it fr
om your own meditation.  When 
you come out of that state afterwards you can see s
o clearly.  The frog is now not just 
"out of the pond onto the dry land, but it’s jumping"
 up into the air.  Even the land is 
disappearing.  With the consciousness disappearing 
you perceive nothing; because 
"you perceive nothing, perception is dying.  You can"
’t watch nothing for too long 
before perception turns off.  When you perceive the
" end of perception, this is what is "
meant by the state of ‘neither perception nor non-p
erception’.  You perceive the 
ending of perception that’s why it’s called non-per
ception.  It just depends on what 
angle you look at it from.  When you perceive the e
"nding of perception, perception "
"finally ends and the mind is gone, deceased, ended,"
" poof, gone. "
313
You 
understand 
that 
all 
these 
dhammas
which 
arose 
from 
a 
cause 
now 
end 
in 
cessation.  You understand those words of Ven.

"samudaya"

"come from a cause, "
!

", must one day cease.  One day, sooner "
"or later, it must happen.  It’s that acceptance and"
 embracing of the possibility of 
cessation which shows that there is an ending and w
hich makes 
!!
 possible.  
Like the shipwrecked sailor floating on the surface
" of the water, you can see dry land, "
the 
only 
place 
where 
you 
can 
be 
saved. 
Whenever 
th
ere 
is 
"movement, "
"doing, "
"speaking and existing, there is suffering.  The Bud"
dha said that even a small amount 
of shit on your finger stinks.  In the same way jus
t a small amount of existing is 
suffering: 
everything 
should 
be 
"abandoned, "
should 
be 
let 
go 
of. 
When 
one 
understands this one understands the path to libera
"tion, to freedom.  Anyone who "
resists this sort of teaching and wants to keep som
ething somewhere – a last piece of 
Dhamma

a 
last 
piece of 
"being, "
whether 
you 
call 
it 
mergin
g 
with 
"God, "
original 
"consciousness, original mind, or whatever, and I do"
n’t care what any other person 
"says – that is delusion, wrong view. "
"When you see things ceasing, you see much deeper th"
an that.  You see the ending of 
things and the ending of things is the most beautif
ul experience.  You can’t get better 
or further than ‘nothing’.  Wherever there is somet
"hing left, there is something more "
"to do, something more to "
samatha
2
 something more to bring to complete cessation and 
freedom.  The reason people can’t let go of the bod
y is the same reason they can’t let 
"go of their minds:  attachment, clinging.  They Wan"
t to find some little corner of 

 for existence where they can still become enlighte
"ned, enjoy it forever and "
come back to teach other people about it.  That is 
wrong view.  It’s almost the same as 
the Mah

y

na concept about being a Bodhisattva and always bei
ng able to come back 
again 
to 
help 
other 
people. 
That’s 
completely 
miss
ing 
the 
point.  
The 
point 
is 
"cessation, "

", "
!!
", the ending of things, the complete "
samatha
 of the whole 
"universe, of existence.  The Buddha found that out,"
 and he said it was hard to see 
"beings in this world, caught up in clinging and att"
"achment, being able to see this deep "
teaching.  It’s true that sometimes we are not cour
ageous enough.  Sometimes we 
"believe others too much, instead of suspending all "
of those views and just trusting in 
the 
"suttas"
.  Stop messing around! 
314
Get into the 
jhanas
", the real "
jhanas
", not the fake ones.  Even today there are many "
people who go around teaching and they know that th
e 
jhanas
" are important, but "
because they have not had that experience themselve
"s, they are dumbing down the "
jhana
 states of mind.  States that are less than the ful
l attainments are being called 
jhanas
. 
The argument about the importance of 
jhanas
 has been won at last.  Even in the 
"United States, talking with people like Jack Kornfi"
"eld and Joseph Goldstein, I think "
that they now understand that you have to get into 
jhanas
 to get anywhere with your 
insight practice.  So when I met them they were pum
ping me for information about 
the 
jhanas
. 
I have taught 
jhanas
" over all these years, keeping a consistent standar"
d for what they 
"are, never wavering in my description of them, expl"
"aining them again and again, and "
putting them in the context of the

why they are important.  I have explained how they

"When you develop the deep meditations, the "
jhanas
", again and again and again, when "
"you look upon them with your own wisdom, challengin"
"g every view, challenging "
"whatever you have heard from any teacher, you will "
see just an incredible emptiness 
315
of both body and mind and the whole universe.  You 
"see that because of that, it can "
"finish, it can end.  You see what a scientist sees:"
  the complete emptiness of the 
"material which makes up this cosmos, this universe "
of solar systems and planets and 
monasteries and whatever else.  You can see it as a
ll empty.  All that is left is 
consciousness. 
You see this physical world as empty and you know h
ow it came out of emptiness.  It 
"arose because of a cause, which means that one day "
this whole universe will vanish in 
the same way.  This mind comes from a cause and one
" day it too will vanish, but "
"unlike the physical universe, it does not re-arise."
"  Most minds take a long time, but as "
soon as you see the 
Dhamma
 and become an



translate that as ‘will be destroyed’.  Why?  Becau

been destroyed.  All those three cravings 
kamatanha
", "
!tanha

have been destroyed.  Craving for sensory pleasure 
is what drives worldlings; the 
craving ‘to be’ is what drives monks. 
"In the end all cravings, including the craving to d"
"estroy things, are nothing more than "
the craving ‘to be’.  The craving to destroy comes 
from thinking there is an existing 
thing that you now want to annihilate.  Please unde
rstand the difference between 
annihilation and cessation.  These are two differen
t words chosen carefully by the 
Buddha.  Annihilation means destroying something th

the

 word.  
-#
" means to destroy, to cut something to bits.  You c"
an’t cut what 
wasn’t there to begin with; you can’t destroy ‘noth

process is different.  The word for an ‘empty proce

"to vanish, is "
