By Marianne Williamson
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
"It is our light, not our darkness"
that most frightens us.
"We ask ourselves,"
"“Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?”"
"Actually, who a"
re you 
not
 to be?
You are a child of God.
Your playing small
does not serve the world.
There's nothing enlightened about shrinking
so that other people won't feel insecure around you.
"We are all meant to shine,"
as children do.
We were born to make manife
st
the glory of God 
that is within us.
It's not just in some of us;
it's in everyone.
"And as we let our own light shine,"
we unconsciously 
give other people permission to do the same.
"As we're liberated from our own fear,"
our presence automatically liber
ates others.
