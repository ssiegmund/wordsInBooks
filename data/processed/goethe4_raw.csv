Who rides at night through wind so wild?
A
solitary father with his child;
He keeps the boy warm in his arm
Holds
him securely away from harm.
“Why’
s 
your face so full of fear?”
“Father 
you see
the 
Elf king
near?
The 
Elf king
 wearing crown and cape?”
“My son it’
s the fog that makes 
that
shape.”
“Beloved child with me you must come
L
ovely games can be begun;
On the beach 
lie
flowers of colours untold
M
y mother will 
bring
you 
garments 
of 
gold.”
“F
ather
father can
’
t yo
u hear
What the 
Elf king
has
promised me

dear?”
“Be calm stay quiet

dear child
Through scrawny leaves the wind 
blows
wild
.”
“
Fine
boy 
will you
go with me?
My daughters await you
joyfully;
They
lead the night
ly
gathering
And with you they’ll 
sway and dance and sing.”
“My father
 don’t you see over there
The Elf
king
’
s daughters in that place of despair?”
“
My son 
my son 
I see it clearly:
Just o
ld willows looking
dreary.”
“I desire this fine young son
I will use force if 
you 
won’t
come.”
“My father
 now he’s 
grabbing
me
And I 
feel pain and misery.”
The horrified father rode
ahead
Clutching the boy mind filled with dread
R
eached
the courtyard

on he sped;
T
he boy 
he held
was still and
dead.
