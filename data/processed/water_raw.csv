This is Water
David Foster Wa

"There are these two young ﬁsh swimming along, and they happen to meet "
an 
older 
ﬁsh 
swimming 
the 
other 
"way, "
who 
nods 
at them and 
"says, "
"“Morning, boys, how's the water?” And the two young ﬁsh swim on for a "
"bit, and then eventually one of "
"them looks over at the other and goes, "
“What the hell is water?”
"If at this moment, you're worried that I plan to present myself here as the "
"wise old ﬁsh explaining what water is to you younger ﬁsh, please don't be. I "
am not the wise old ﬁsh. The immediate point of the ﬁsh story is that the 
"most obvious, ubiquitous, important realities are often the ones that are "
"the hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, "
this is just a 
banal platitude 
—
but the fact is 
"that, in the "
day
-
to
-
day 
trenches of 
adult 
"existence, "
banal 
platitudes 
can 
have 
life
-
or
-
death 
"importance. That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense."

A huge percentage of the stu
ﬀ
" that I tend to be automatically certain of is, "
"it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. Here's one example of the utter "
wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: Everything in 
my own 
immediate experience 
supports 
my 
deep 
belief 
that 
I 
am the 
absolute 
center 
of 
the 
"universe, "
"the realest, "
most vivid and important 
"person in existence. We rarely talk about this sort of natural, basic self"
-
"centeredness, because it's so socially repulsive, but it's pretty much the "
"same for all of us, deep down. It is our default"
-
"setting, hard"
-
wired into our 
boards at birth. Think about it: There is no experience you've had that you 
were not at the absolute center of. The world as you experience it is right 
"there in front of you, or behind you, to the left or right of you, on your TV, "
"or your monitor, or whatever. Other people's thoughts and feelings have to "
"be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, "
real 
—
you get the idea. But please don't worry that I'm getting ready to 
preach 
to 
you about compassion or 
other
-
directedness 
or the 
so
-
called 
“virtues.” This is not a matter of virtue 
—
 it's a matter of my choosing to do 
"the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard"
-
wired 
default
-
"setting, which is to be deeply and literally self"
-
"centered, and to see "
and interpret everything through this lens of self.
People who can adjust their 
natural default
-
setting 
this way 
are often 
described 
as being 
“well 
"adjusted,” which "
I 
suggest to you is 
not 
an 
accidental term.
Given the triumphal 
"academic setting here, "
an obvious question is how 
much 
of 
this 
work 
of 
adjusting 
our 
default
-
setting 
involves 
actual 
knowledge 
or 
intellect. This 
question 
gets tricky. Probably the 
most 
"dangerous thing about college education, at least in my own case, is that it "
enables my tendency to over
-
intellectualize stu
ﬀ
", "
to get lost in abstract 
arguments 
inside 
my 
head instead of 
simply paying attention 
to 
what's 
going on right in front of me. Paying attention to what's going on inside 
"me. As I'm sure you guys know by now, it is extremely di"
ﬃ
cult to stay alert 
and attentive instead 
of getting hypnotized 
by the constant monologue 
"inside your own head. Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come "
2
gradually to understand that the liberal
-
arts cliché about “teaching you how 
to think” is 
actually shorthand 
for 
a much 
"deeper, "
more serious 
idea: 
“Learning how to think” really means learning how to exercise some control 
over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough 
to choose what you pay attention 
to and to choose how you construct 
meaning 
from 
experience. Because 
if 
you 
cannot exercise 
this 
kind 
of 
"choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old cliché about "
"“the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.” This, like many "
"clichés, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great "
and 
terrible truth. 
It is 
not the 
least 
bit coincidental 
that adults 
who 
commit suicide with ﬁrearms almost always shoot themselves in the head. 
And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before 
"they pull the trigger. And I submit that this is what the real, no"
-
bull
-
 value 
of your liberal
-
arts education is supposed to be about: How to keep from 
"going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, "
"unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default"
-
setting of 
"being uniquely, completely, imperially alone, day in and day out."
"That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense. So let's get concrete. "
The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what 
"“day in, day out” really means. There happen to be whole large parts of "
adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. 
One 
such part involves 
"boredom, "
"routine, and "
petty 
frustration. The 
parents and older folks here will know all too well what I'm talking about.
By 
way 
"of example, let's say it's an "
"average day, "
and 
you get up in the 
"morning, go to your challenging job, and you work hard for nine or ten "
"hours, and at the end of the day you're tired, and you're stressed out, and all "
you want is to go home and have a good supper and maybe unwind for a 
couple of hours and then hit the rack early because you have to get up the 
next day and do it all again. But then you remember there's no food at 
home 
—
you haven't 
had 
time 
to 
shop 
this 
"week, "
because 
of 
your 
challenging job 
—
 and so now after work you have to get in your car and 
"drive to the supermarket. It's the end of the workday, and the tra"
ﬃ
c's very 
3
"bad, so getting to the store takes way longer than it should, and when you "
"ﬁnally get there the supermarket is very crowded, because of course it's the "
time of day when all the other people with jobs also try to squeeze in some 
"grocery shopping, and the store's hideously, ﬂuorescently lit, and infused "
with soul
-
killing 
"Muzak or corporate pop, and it's pretty much the last "
"place you want to be, but you can't just get in and quickly out: You have to "
"wander all over the huge, overlit store's crowded aisles to ﬁnd the stu"
ﬀ
 you 
"want, and you have to maneuver your junky cart through all these other "
"tired, hurried people with carts, and of course there are also the glacially "
slow old people and the spacey people and the ADHD kids who all block 
the aisle and you have to grit your teeth and try to be polite as you ask 
"them to let you by, and eventually, ﬁnally, you get all your supper supplies, "
except 
now it turns out there aren't 
enough checkout lanes open 
even 
though it's the end
-
of
-
the
-
day
-
"rush, so the checkout line is incredibly long, "
"which is stupid and infuriating, but you can't take your fury out on the "
frantic lady working the register.
"Anyway, you ﬁnally get to the checkout line's front, and pay for your food, "
"and wait to get your check or card authenticated by a machine, and then "
get told to “Have a nice day” in a voice that is the absolute voice of 
"death,"
and then you have to take your creepy ﬂimsy plastic bags of groceries in 
"your cart through the crowded, bumpy, littery parking lot, and try to load "
the bags in your car in such a way that everything doesn't fall out of the 
"bags and roll around in the trunk on the way home, and then you have to "
"drive all the way home through slow, heavy, SUV"
-
intensive rush
-
hour tra
ﬃ
"c, "
"etcetera, etcetera."
"The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work "
of choosing comes in. Because the tra
ﬃ
c jams and crowded aisles and long 
"checkout lines give me time to think, and "
if 
I 
don't make 
a conscious 
"decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I'm going to be "
pissed and miserable every time I have to food
-
"shop, because my natural "
default
-
setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about 
m
e
", about my hungriness and my fatigue and my desire to just get home, "
4
"and it's going to seem, for all the world, like everybody else is just "
in my way
", "
and who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most of 
them are and how stupid and cow
-
like and dead
-
eyed and nonhuman they 
"seem here in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that "
"people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line, and look "
at how deeply unfair this is: I've worked really hard all day and I'm starved 
and tired and I can't even get home to eat and unwind because of all these 
stupid god
-
damn 
peopl
e
.
"Or, of course, if I'm in a more socially conscious form of my default"
-
"setting, "
I can spend time in the end
-
of
-
the
-
day tra
ﬃ
c jam being angry and disgusted 
"at all the huge, stupid, lane"
-
blocking SUV's and Hummers and V
-
12 pickup 
"trucks burning their wasteful, selﬁsh, forty"
-
"gallon tanks of gas, and I can "
dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumper stickers always seem 
"to be on the biggest, most disgustingly selﬁsh vehicles driven by the ugliest, "
"most inconsiderate and aggressive drivers, who are usually talking on cell "
phones as they cut people o
ﬀ
 in order to get just twenty stupid feet ahead 
in a tra
ﬃ
"c jam, and I "
can think about how our children's children will 
despise us for wasting all the future's fuel and probably screwing up the 
"climate, and how spoiled and stupid and disgusting we all are, and how it all "
just 
sucks
", and so on and so forth..."
"Look, "
if 
I 
choose 
to think 
this 
"way, "
"ﬁne, lots "
of us 
do 
—
 except that 
thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic it doesn't 
hav
e
 to be a 
choice. Thinking this way is my natural default
-
"setting. It's the automatic, "
"unconscious way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of "
"adult life when I'm operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I "
am the center of the world and that my immediate needs and feelings are 
what should determine the world's priorities. The thing is that there are 
obviously di
ﬀ
erent ways to think about these kinds of situations. In this 
tra
ﬃ
"c, all these vehicles stuck and idling in my way: It's not impossible that "
some of these people in SUV's have been in horrible auto accidents in the 
past and 
now ﬁnd driving so traumatic that their therapist has all but 
"ordered them to get a huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to "
5
drive; or that the Hummer that just cut me o
ﬀ
 is maybe being driven by a 
"father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he's "
"trying to rush to the hospital, and he's in a way bigger, more legitimate "
hurry than I am 
—
 it is actually 
I
 who am in 
his 
way. Or I can choose to 
force 
myself 
to 
consider 
the 
likelihood 
that 
everyone 
else 
in 
the 
"supermarket's checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that "
"some of these people probably have much harder, more tedious or painful "
"lives than I do, overall."
"Again, please don't think that I'm giving you moral "
"advice, or that I'm "
"saying you're “supposed to” think this way, or that anyone expects you to "
"just automatically do it, because it's hard, it takes will and mental e"
ﬀ
"ort, "
"and if you're like me, some days you won't be able to do it, or you just ﬂat"
-
"out won't want to. But most days, if you're aware enough to give yourself a "
"choice, you can choose to look di"
ﬀ
"erently at this fat, dead"
-
"eyed, over"
-
made
-
lady who just screamed at her little child in the checkout line 
—
 maybe 
she's not usually like this; maybe she's been up three straight nights holding 
"the hand of her husband who's dying of bone cancer, or maybe this very "
lady is the low
-
wage clerk at the Motor Vehicles Dept. who just yesterday 
helped your spouse resolve a nightmarish red
-
tape problem through some 
"small act of bureaucratic kindness. Of course, none of this is likely, but it's "
also not impossible 
—
 it just depends on what you want to consider. If 
you're automatically sure that you know what reality is and who and what is 
really important 
—
 if you want to operate on your default
-
setting 
—
 then 
"you, like "
"me, "
will 
not consider 
possibilities 
that 
aren't pointless and 
"annoying. But if you've really learned how to think, how to pay attention, "
then you will know you have other options. It will actually be within your 
"power to experience a crowded, loud, slow, consumer"
-
hell
-
type situation as 
"not only meaningful but sacred, on ﬁre with the same force that lit the stars "
—
" compassion, "
"love, "
the 
sub
-
surface 
unity of 
all things. Not that that 
mystical stu
ﬀ
's necessarily true: The only thing that's capital
-
T True is that 
you get to 
decid
e
 how you're going to try to see it. You get to consciously 
decide what has meaning 
and what doesn't. You get to decide what to 
worship...
6
Because here's something else that's true. 
In the day
-
to
-
day trenches of 
"adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing "
as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is 
w
ha
t
 to 
worship. And an 
outstanding reason for choosing 
some 
sort of God or 
spiritual
-
type thing to worship 
—
" be it J.C. or Allah, be it Yahweh or the "
Wiccan mother
-
goddess or the Four Noble Truths or some infrangible set 
of ethical principles 
—
 is that pretty much anything else you worship will 
eat you alive. If you worship money and things 
—
 if they are where you tap 
real meaning in life 
—
 then you will never have enough. Never feel you have 
enough. It's the truth. Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure 
"and you will always feel ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will "
"die a million deaths before they ﬁnally plant you. On one level, we all know "
this stu
ﬀ
 already 
—
" it's been codiﬁed as myths, proverbs, clichés, bromides, "
"epigrams, parables: the skeleton of every great story. The trick is keeping "
the truth up
-
front in daily consciousness. Worship power 
—
 you will feel 
"weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to keep the "
"fear at bay. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart "
—
 you will end up 
"feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. And so on."
"Look, the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're "
evil 
or 
sinful; it 
is 
that they are 
unconscious. 
They are 
default
-
settings. 
They're 
the kind 
of worship 
you just gradually slip 
"into, "
day 
"after day, "
getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure 
value without ever being fully aware that that's what you're doing. And the 
world 
will 
not 
discourage you 
from operating 
on 
your default
-
"settings, "
because the world of men and money and power hums along quite nicely on 
the fuel of fear and contempt and frustration and craving and the worship 
of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that 
have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The 
freedom to be lords of our own tiny skull
-
"sized kingdoms, alone at the "
center of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But 
of course there are all di
ﬀ
"erent kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most "
precious you will not hear much talked about in the great outside world of 
winning 
and achieving 
and displaying. The 
really 
important kind 
of 
7
"freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and e"
ﬀ
"ort, and "
"being able truly to care about other people and to sacriﬁce for them, over "
"and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day. That is real freedom. "
"The alternative is unconsciousness, the default"
-
"setting, the “rat race” "
—
 the 
constant gnawing sense of having had and lost some inﬁnite thing.
I know that this stu
ﬀ
 probably doesn't sound fun and breezy or grandly 
"inspirational. What it is, so far as I can see, is the truth with a whole lot of "
"rhetorical bullshit pared away. Obviously, you can think of it whatever you "
wish. But please don't dismiss it as some ﬁnger
-
wagging Dr. Laura sermon. 
"None of this is about morality, or religion, or dogma, or big fancy questions "
of life after death. The capital
-
T Truth is about life 
befor
e
 death. It is about 
"making it to 30, or maybe 50, without wanting to shoot yourself in the "
head. It is about simple awareness 
—
 awareness 
of 
what is so real and 
"essential, "
so hidden 
in plain 
sight all 
"around us, "
that we have 
to keep 
"reminding ourselves, over and over: “This is water, this is water.”"
"It is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive, day in and "
day out.
